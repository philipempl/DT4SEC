Akbarian2021;HIGH;Therefore,in this paper, we propose a digital twin-based security framework for ICS that consists of two parts: attack detection and attack mitigation. In this framework we deploy an intrusion detection system in digital domain that can detect attacks in a timely manner. Then, using our mitigation method, we keep the system stable with acceptable performance during the attack. Additionally, we implement our framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks.  / Considering the vulnerability of industrial control systems to cyber attacks especially when they are controlled over the cloud, in this paper we proposed a security framework using the concept of digital twins. In this framework, we designed a residual generator in the digital domain that can detect attacks so quickly with the help of a decision system. To mitigate the effects of attacks, we added a local controller on the factory floor close to the plant, which is switched in to recover the;With digital twins, we have virtual replicas of physical systems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of the physical systems;Digital twin based intrusion detection   and mitigation has some advantages. As the digital twin is   deployed in the cloud, an intrusion detection system in the   digital domain (cloud) can include methods that require much   more computing resources than if deployed in the real system.   Also, our intrusion detection is implemented close to the   controller when we control the system over the cloud and   the controller is deployed in the cloud. Hence, the intrusion   detection has access to the signals that are sent to the cloud   for the controller and can evaluate whether they are healthy or manipulated. ;Smart Manufacturing;intrusion detection,attack mitigation;Cloud, Edge;ICS (Intrusion Control System) The ball and   beam system consists of a long beam which can be tilted by an   electric motor together with a ball rolling back and forth on top   of the beam.;Time data, state vector, measurement signal, control signal, process noise, measurement noise;DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;digital twin;N/A;Kubernetes, nginx, Prometheus, Model predictive control-based controller MPC;Monitoring, Simulation, Kalman Filter;N/A;YES;N/A;N/A

Brockhoff2021;HIGH;In the context of this paper, we aim to extend the process so that the DT application is produced automatically in a single integrated generation step.

They facilitate real-time management of energy consumption and production patterns, thus minimizing energy waste and im- proving efficiency. Moreover, DTs offer predictive capabilities, enabling accurate forecasting of maintenance requirements, resulting in reduced downtime and maintenance costs, thereby enhancing the reliability of energy systems. 2) Sustainability and Energy Transition: DTs have the potential to optimize the environmental impact of energy systems in smart cities by enabling efficient energy generation and consumption. They play a crucial role in the rapid adoption and seamless integration of RES, leading to a reduction in carbon emissions and ensuring sustainability, in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. DTs facilitate effective management of RES, such as solar and wind power, by predicting their energy output and performance under different operating conditions. This enables utilities to optimize the use of RES, minimizing reliance on fossil fuels, and reducing the overall carbon footprint of energy systems. In1) Integration Issues with other technologies: The inte- gration of DTs with other digital technologies in the context of energy applications presents huge challenges that must be ad- dressed. The two key challenges that emerge in this context are data interoperability and increased system complexity. These challenges arise due to the existence of diverse data formats and protocols across multiple technologies. Such diversity can also restrict the scalability of the system, thereby inhibiting the consideration of system expansion and growth. 2) Cost: DTs have the potential to offer significant benefits in the energy sector, however, their implementation poses a critical challenge due to cost considerations. The implemen- tation of DTs requires substantial investments in hardware, software, and expertise. The cost of implementing DTs is, therefore, a crucial factor that must be taken into account. As such, it is essential to evaluate the costs of implementing DTs against their potential benefits in order to make informed decisions regarding their use in the energy sector. 1) Standardization: One key limitation related to imple- menting DTs in the energy sector and smart cities can be the establishment of common technical specifications and protocols to ensure interoperability and compatibility among different systems and processes. Without standardized DT components and protocols, DTs may not reach their full potential in terms of improving efficiency and optimizing the performance of energy systems. 2) Security Concern: The implementation of DTs in the energy sector raises significant concerns regarding security, as the technology’s operation is susceptible to cyberattacks, data privacy violations, and physical security breaches. The security implications in the energy sector are multi-dimensional, neces- sitating a comprehensive approach to address these concerns. Such an approach must comprise a multi-layered framework that encompasses best cybersecurity practices, regulatory com- pliance with data privacy guidelines, and physical security measures.  3) Advancements in AI and ML: Advancements in AI and ML have been instrumental in facilitating the development of DT use-cases in the energy sector and smart cities. With the ability to process large and heterogeneous data from sensors in real-time, AI and ML algorithms enable the DT to perform accurate monitoring and control of the system, leading to online optimization, enhanced forecasting, and improved simulation capabilities."" this way, DTs are a valuable tool to promote sustainable development and mitigate climate change in smart cities."; 
Calo2018;LOW;In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed.;N/A;The devices can use such a model to determine whether or not they should allow access to any resource or service that is being requested of them.;Enterprise Organization;access control;Embedded;IoT Device;States depending on sensor data (unsafe/safe);DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;digital twin;N/A;N/A;Simulation;device state model;NO;N/A;Defining the right ?high-level guidance?:Access control policies were introduced as the general approach for simplifying the application of access control mechanisms to a divergent Blue Sky Session: Next Generation Security Services for Emerging Networks SACMAT?18, June 13-15, 2018, Indianapolis, IN, USA4 set of use-cases. We need to define a similar concept for ?high level guidance? which will be applicable to various scenarios and contexts in a general way. The semantics to be used for high-level guidance needs to be defined. While that semantics can be defined for each of the different generation approaches discussed in Section 3, an open challenge remains that of identifying the abstraction that will create the concept of the ?high level guidance? that will be applicable to a broad set of use-case scenarios regardless of the approach used to generate policies. (2) Defining the right discovery process: Generating the right access control policy requires each of the resources in the environment to be aware of the other devices in the environment. Given the lack of widely adopted standards for discovery of resources, and the many security exposures that may result from a flawed discovery process, new discovery techniques that can provide sufficient security in many dynamic contexts are needed. (3) Determining the situational context: The definition of the situational context, as well as its determination, remains a hard and open research challenge. Access control needs to account for not only the other resources that any given resource interacts with, but also for the resources that may indirectly use the information provided by that resource. Understanding the situation on the ground in sufficient detail to provide workable security is a challenge that can be solved on a case-by-case basis, but a general formulation remains an open challenge. (4) Policy deconfliction without human guidance: When access control policies are generated by the resources, they may conflict among themselves, or with other policies that are imposed on the system to meet other requirements, such as performance, reliability or availability requirements. In the presence of a human, such conflicts can be resolved and deconflicted using the human provided input. Similar algorithms, which can operate without a human in the loop, need to be developed. (5) Controlling emergent behavior: When resources create their own policies, there is a danger of uncontrolled emergent behavior [15]. Emergent behavior is behavior shown by a collection of systems which was not originally designed but happens due to the dynamic interactions among different intelligent systems. Such emergent behavior can be controlled, but the design needs to account for that. The control of emergent behavior in complete generality remains an open challenge, but there may be solutions that can be developed for specific domain of access control. (6) Learning-related challenges: The approach used by resources to learn their access control policy has to use some type of learning approach, which creates a generalization based on its past experiences, but such learning mechanism has its challenges. The set of experiences for access control in each use-case has only a few small data points to draw from, which means that either existing learning techniques that use only a few data points need to be used, or new learning techniques requiring small data for training needs to be actor may manipulate the data so as to force the device to learn an invalid model which could lead to generation of insecure access control policies. Solutions to such adversarial learning in uncontrolled environments need to be developed. (7) Increase in attack surface. The increase in complexity due to autonomous generation of policies by devices can lead to new types of security vulnerabilities and threats, e.g. the adversarial learning example given above. This could lead to challenges with established assurance processes in enterprise and government networks, and the right way to provide assurance for systems using dynamically generated access control policies need to be developed. (8) Power, computation and communication efficiency. While in the past several years there have been tremendous advantages in the computational capacity of small devices, devices that need to learn and manage their own policies may find themselves unable to use approaches that require specialized hardware, or significant computational power, e.g. learning mechanisms based on deep neural networks. For any solution developed with dynamic access control policies, system design should incorporate mechanisms that take into account the limitations on a resource, which usually manifests itself as limited amount of battery power, computational capacity or the ability to communicate at high bandwidth rates.

Dietz2020abc;HIGH;N/A;The Digital Twin (DT) is an assets virtual counterpart that enables enterprises to digitally mirror and manage an asset along its lifecycle This asset can be tangible as well as non tangible   rangingfrom turbines to services Enterprise ASSET ASSET LIFECYCLE DATA SOURCES  DIGITAL TWIN SEMANTIC TECHNOLOGIES DATA ANALYSIS INTERFACES AND Asset CONTROL;Here, a DT can play animportant role to mitigate or even avoid these risks bycomprehensively informing about the real-world assets status, history and its maintenance needs. Moreover, someDTs even provide a direct interaction with the asset.;Smart Manufacturing;security testing;Cloud, Embedded;Every Asset;N/A;DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;digital twin;N/A;N/A;Analysis, intelligence, simulation and other services;N/A;NO;DTs  require  substantial technical efforts from  firms. Especially the incorporation of heterogeneous data requires further  progress.  For  instance,  the  standardization  in  data acquisition needs to be accelerated. Also, issues with real-time data have to be focused on. For instance, the manual acquisition of real-time data has to be automated  to  enable  the  collection  of  full  historical  data instead of snapshots. Another great technical burden is the current decentralization. Interfaces, connections and the like need to be developed to enable a more holistic approach. Moreover, security concerns have to  be  addressed.  This  includes  version  management  and compatibility  checks  of  the  DT  versions  to  ensure  data integrity  as  well  as  access  management  to  allow  third parties to access (parts of) the virtual twin. At different levels, corporate challenges remain. While operational  challenges  mostly  overlap  with  the  technical challenges, the DT potentially implies major economic and organizational  transformations  at  a  strategic  level.  The strategic decision of DT implementation focuses on but is not  limited  to  the  degree  of  asset-centralization  of  an organization. The degree of reflecting the real-world  asset  varies  depending  on  the  use  case.  Consequently, this poses yet another corporate challenge in terms of  depth  of  detail  and  granularity.  Moreover,  the  study indicates  that  at  present,  the  term  ??Digital  Twin??  can  be misleading as it is applied for slightly different phenomena in  different  areas. Entangled with  the  complexity  of  DTs,  a  further  strategic  decision bases on the tradeoff between the cost of an asset versus the cost  of  the  DT  and  its  data  granularity  (e.g.  by  including sensors). However, with the general decrease in storage and sensor  cost,  the implementation  of  DTs  tends  to  become more  attractive.  Moreover,  the  emergence  of  novel business  models, including such where the organization does not possess  the asset but provides the service of establishing a DT, will  entail major privacy issues ? including the question of ownership of the virtual counterpart;Although  first  assumptions  about  the  effects  of  DTs exist, future research should analyze the concrete technical and  corporate  implications.  One  impact  of  DTs  concerns the  improvement  in  interconnectivity,  especially  within supply  chains,  where  research  should  not  be limited  to  a single  firm?s  perspective  but  rather  take  a  system-of-systems  approach.  Another  potential  for  enterprises  is  the closure  of  feedback  loops  along  and  the  coherent  linkage between the lifecycle phases of the asset. Here, the gain of new  insights  can  lead  to  a  win-win  situation  among  the involved  parties.  Currently,  very  little  is  known  about potential data-driven business models, their power of digital  disruptiveness  and  pricing  strategies  for  DT  services. Research can contribute by identifying the strategic role of DTs for firms and its position in digital transformation, not only from the perspectives of companies owning the DTsbut  also  from  third  parties  contributing  to  the  resources.

In this regard, (security) patch testing with digital twins might also be an interesting area to investigate.

The replication mode entails direct mirroring of the real-world counterpart including all its states.

To offer more and advanced attack scenarios, different high-fidelity domain-models (e.g., physical, logical, network) of a system might be merged into one digital twin simulation. Additionally, a combination of digital twins and deception technologies (e.g., honeypots) might provide input for CTI reports on attacks the SOC is currently not aware of. For systematic CTI generation and the usage of the STIX2.1 format, aspects of recommender systems are worth investigating. Comparing objects and relationship paths could assist the applicability assessment and lead to the most helpful CTI report generation.;Generally, the creation of digital twins is a complex task and organizations might put emphasis on different charac- teristics. Thus, not every digital twin might be suitable for security simulations as it is strongly dependent on whether the digital twin contains characteristics an attack is based on.

Thus, analog values that constitute stimuli must be converted to a binary representation, before they can be replicated in the virtual environment. However, considering that CPSs typically consist of analog-intensive components, further research in this area is worth pursuing.;While the results of this work are promising, there are still some challenges to be addressed to improve the state replication approach. For example, depending on the nature of the device or caused by inaccuracies of the specification, inferring the device?s characteristics based on the role definition may be infeasible. In this case, users are required to either add details about stimuli or explicitly label inputs as stimuli. Another possible option, yet more complex to implement, may be to develop a code analyzer that automatically inspects all programs, which are referenced in a CPS?s specification, for the purpose of stimuli identification. Furthermore, as our approach focuses only on states of software programs, support for replicating stimuli that manifest themselves in the form of analog signals is lacking. Thus, analog values that constitute stimuli must be converted to a binary representation, before they can be replicated in the virtual environment

Overcoming this challenge seems to be also relevant for digital-twin research in general, since data flows from a digital twin (back) to its physical counterpart can serve as a response mechanism.

CPS Emulation & Virtualization Tooling. One severe limitation is the emulation of field and control devices, such as programmable logic con- trollers (PLCs), since their hardware and software components are often proprietary and closed- source. However, the advent of PLCs with embed- ded Linux and the growth of open-source initia- tives could alleviate this situation. Nevertheless, suitable system emulator targets will be required. Trade-Off Between Fidelity & Cost. Another challenge is to balance the fidelity of an SEDT and the effort of implementation such that target use cases are sufficiently supported while costs and development time are kept under control. Naturally, high-fidelity SEDTs necessitate the in- tegration of sophisticated physical models and a (near-)complete coverage of components via em- ulations, which requires considerable implemen- tation effort or is simply infeasible. On the other hand, imperfections of models are inevitable, thus, care has to be taken that wrong assumptions or mismatches will not lead to a false sense of assurance and, subsequently, wrong decision- making. One promising solution to keep the costs and time for approximating the physics man- ageable is to combine the conventional physics- based approach with data-driven modeling if ap- proximating through learning is sufficient for the intended purpose. It is also worth noting that there are additional factors, which may be interrelated with fidelity or cost, that need to be considered when implementing SEDTs. For instance, higher fidelity SEDTs may generate significant network traffic, thereby potentially affecting network per- formance or even the CPS itself (e.g., in the case of polling for synchronization). Synchronization. Most of the described secu- rity use cases unlock their true value if SEDTs are synchronized with their corresponding CPSs. However, problems related to synchronization re- main challenging for the community. For exam- ple, defining an initial state for synchronization and identifying which system inputs serve as stimuli and, hence, need to be replicated in the virtual environment requires further investigation. Other important aspects to consider are real-time constraints and timing issues, which could lead to the state of the SEDT drifting from reality. To handle such synchronization errors, mechanisms to recover from state mismatches are required. Security Implications of SEDTs. While the promises of SEDTs may seem attractive, certain applications could also raise new concerns that potentially nullify the benefits. For instance, in the case of intrusion detection, the SEDT may be susceptible to the same vulnerability as its physical counterpart. Thus, attackers can poten- tially evade intrusion detection if malicious states are replicated, and the SEDT is equally affected by this vulnerability. It should also not go un- noticed that DTs, by themselves, may introduce additional cybersecurity risks [15]. Consequently, careful consideration should be given to securing the DTs and their connection to their physical counterparts.

The design of a specific implementation can be structured in several ways.We recommend a design based on virtual machines, dockerized applications, and specific connectors for a straightforward adoption and application of the capability modules. As we admit in the introduction, data is vital to generate wisdom. By bundling the data sources and types of data (stream vs batch) required to fulfil a particular capability module (e.g., the descriptive module takes batch data), analytical techniques can be instantiated. Thus, each capability module should be represented by one virtual machine. The virtual machines can be interconnected with dedicated bridges to accomplish the dependencies between the capability modules. Each of the virtual machines is running on Docker to establish containerized and modular applications. There are many open-source software and tools for security analytics applications that need to be categorized depending on their functionality, e.g., Suricata is an intrusion detection tool and is, therefore, available in the detective module. In this context, the security analytics repository is considered a collection of dockerized applications. Besides provisioning dockerized applications, the security analytics repositories need to yield connectors for each application to bind multiple applications? sinks and sources. Additionally, machine learning models can be shared across the security analytics repository and integrated into the desired capability module. Those machine learning models might be integrated into the predictive module (stream data) and the descriptive module (batch data). The different analytical techniques can be tagged inside the security analytics repository (e.g. for detective module) and ranked by other users. These mechanisms are resulting in transparency as to which methods are successfully contributing to the cybersecurity;(Besides the contribution, this paper exhibits two limitations. First, we do not specify any access control roles to our security analytics service, as we have only covered a single entity (security expert). Second, we excluded parts of the incident response. As the response opportunities to a detected or predicted threat increase with the complexity of IIoT systems, e.g., with software-defined networks for the ICS, a holistic sketch of interconnections within the archi- tectural module is almost impossible.)

We expect benefits of identify- ing additional use cases (e.g., execution of playbooks against a group of IoT assets) and formalizing playbook logic. Future work should assist security analysts from initial (automated) playbook creation based on manufacturers? course of ac- tion recommendations to playbook ? event matching and (prioritized) execution. Therefore, playbooks must consider organizational incident response processes and their under- lying principles.;N/A

Empl2023a;HIGH;In this paper, we introduce vulnerability playbooks based on open standards. Pushing the envelope of cybersecurity playbooks—steps organizations should follow when responding to cybersecurity incidents reactively—for ICS vulnerability management offers organizations a more transparent, repeatable process and faster, possibly automated actions. We have designed a process model to collect and transform security advi- sories in Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) format and generate Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) playbooks based on listed remediation advice. With a proof of concept, we demonstrate that structured CSAF documents can be seamlessly transformed into CACAO playbooks. For our industrial use case, we must also use unstructured security advice highlighting quality differences (compared to CSAF). Our generated 79 standard conformant CACAO playbooks with 485 identified actions hint at imbalanced advice toward patching. Preferably, vendors should include detailed technical remediation advice, provide APIs, and go beyond patching recommendations in their security advisories. Subscribers should structure their assets and use machine learning to normalize, generate, and prioritize CACAO playbooks. With CSAF and CACAO, we see two open standards for handling vulnerabilities. ;N/A;Structure of assets;Smart Manufacturing;Vulnerability management;cloud;Siemens and Cisco devices;Device data, CPEs, CVEs etc.;DIGITAL_PHYSICAL, DIGITAL_EXPERT, DIGITAL_DIGITAL;digital twin;CACAO, EPSS, CVE, CPE, CSAF, CVRF;MongoDB, Eclipse Ditto;analysis;user created;NO;Future research can focus on further integration of open standards and their various features. While we use match- ing terms to extract workflow actions, artificial intelligence (e.g., large language models) might be able to build techni- cal commands and add conditional workflow logic. Toward automated playbook execution, we also see the necessity to incorporate organization-specific factors as remediation measures could be deliberately kept vague to serve all archi- tectures and systems equally well. Additionally, our work is based on available ICS data. As a result, our vulnerability playbooks are specific to ICS. It is worth investigating vul- nerability playbook generation for IT assets. Future research could also compare more ICS advisories from plenty ven- dors to deepen the discussion on recommendations, but also measure the scalability of our vulnerability playbook gener- ation process in larger environments. Another crucial aspect for future research is to target complex and dynamic doc- umentation requirements in large scale ICS environments. ;We have a few limitations concerning the application and evaluation. Design decisions had to be made in implementing our application following our process model. Therefore, we extended the JSON schema of CACAO and CSAF to a small extent due to the choice of specific technologies. For exam- ple, in the CACAO schema, we had to exclude trailing dollar signs for the data type identifiers to maintain compatibility with MongoDB. In addition, the proposed NLP procedure is inaccurate in terms of contextual understanding, the dis- tinction between nouns and verbs, or sketchy texts. Our NLP implementation cannot accurately pinpoint the relationship between actions and targets. Additionally, we cannot iden- tify the target. In addition, our evaluation has some further limitations. First, it is partway biased due to a large num- ber of security advisories from Siemens ProductCERT and CISA ICS Cert. Hence, we cannot generally argue about the generated playbooks’ quality and completeness across all security advisories. We can only observe that structured data yield better results than unstructured. Second, we have only connected three CERTs as potential sources for secu- rity advisories (limited to the last 150 days) based on our devices. And third, our playbook generation does not retain conditional logic or parallel flows (if existent in security advisories). The current mapping is rigidly sequential. We declare the handling of different versions of security advi- sories out of scope, e.g., those from Siemens ProductCERT. Last, we face limitations regarding the dependence on physi- cal processes, insufficient contextual knowledge, limitations in dealing with hardware modifications, complex configura- tion and documentation requirements, applicability to small environments, and modeling temporary response actions.

This includes the creation of specialized tools and methodologies designed explicitly for IoT/CPS environments, which can address the complex challenges posed by varying protocol layers, the acquisition and analysis of spatial and temporal data, and the simulation of cyber-physical interactions. Efforts should also focus on enhancing the adaptability of vulnerability assessment frameworks, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), to better reflect the specific risks associated with different types of devices in these settings. Additionally, research should explore the standardization of adversarial capabilities and objectives within simulation models to improve the resilience of IoT/CPS against sophisticated threats. Such initiatives require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from cybersecurity, data science, and systems engineering to develop solutions that are both effective and scalable across the diverse IoT/CPS landscape.;The IoT/CPS domain presents several challenges that stem from its inherent diversity and complexity. The wide variety of devices, each with unique functionalities and vulnerabilities, complicates the development of universal security tools and strategies. The presence of legacy and low-level devices, which may not adhere to standard protocols, poses additional difficulties in implementing effective network mapping and vulnerability detection techniques. Furthermore, the process of modeling and analyzing CPS to assess their resilience against cyber threats is hindered by the lack of standardized methods for characterizing target assets and translating security requirements into simulation environments. The evolving nature of threats, combined with the unique combinations of vulnerabilities found in IoT devices, further exacerbates these challenges. Additionally, the reliance on web-based interfaces for many IoT devices introduces vulnerabilities that, while previously addressed in broader internet contexts, resurface in this new domain due to challenges in maintaining up-to-date security measures. Addressing these issues requires innovative approaches that can accommodate the specific needs of IoT/CPS systems, ensuring their security and resilience in the face of an ever-changing threat landscape.

The simplest definition would state that DTs are virtual models or emulations that mimic their physical counterparts. Fully integrated DTs are virtual twins that are interacting with their physical twins in both directions. ;The great potential of DTs in enhancing ICS security is expounded by Dietz and Pernul in [4].

Franco2022a;HIGH;automotive firmware is transformed into a CDT, which contains automatically extracted, security-relevant information from the firmware. Based on the CDT, we evaluate security requirements through automated analysis and requirements verification using policy enforcement checks and vulnerabilities detection. The evaluation of a CDT is conducted continuously integrating new checks derived from new security requirements and from newly disclosed vulnerabilities. We applied our approach to about 100 automotive firmwares. In average, about 600 publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and 80 unknown weaknesses were detected per firmware in the pre-production phase. Therefore, the use of a CDT enables efficient continuous verification of security requirements.;The Digital Twin (DT) is a concept to digitally rep- resent physical objects to simulate them before they are built or to enable predictive mainte- nance. ? In this article, a CDT is a digital representation of an automotive firmware, which is a class of software stored and executed on Electronic Control Units (ECUs).;Such CDTs provide many advantages with respect to automated security evaluation of automotive firmwares, especially considering that large parts of software are built based on other software libraries and frameworks, which are not available as source code.

The creation of the CDT consists of: the firmware extraction, the software composition analysis (SCA) and the licensing analysis. ;YES;In future work, we plan to extend our ap- proach to automatically generate test cases for the CDT based on common cybersecurity require- ments of automotive software. From the software bill of materials, we get a list of libraries used and the deployed versions. We can use this informa- tion to generate fuzz test cases in several ways. The first and most straightforward way would be to use specific protocol fuzzers for libraries that use known protocols. Second, for the open- source libraries, we can retrieve the interfaces and potentially mine input grammars from the repos- itories directly. Third, for commercial libraries, the further control and data flow analyses on the binaries can be used for fuzzing. Fourth, we could build a database of popular libraries, their interfaces and interesting attach surfaces to fuzz corresponding tests.;N/A

Moreover, we intend to leverage the proposed framework to go one step further in managing dependencies-related threats. Especially considering cascading failure, we intend to en- able collaborative and autonomous cascading failure recovery across legacy DM solutions using a cooperative multi-agent system. ;One of the main limitations of our work is that DM actors should manually publish and maintain extraction modalities within our framework. Despite being inspired by the ITU-T Recommendation Y.4459 [10] for information exchange between isolated organiza- tions in the form of digital entities, manual data sharing may impact the coherence of the generated context KGs and the fidelity of the constructed digital twins. An alternative solution is to make use of a multi-agent system [25] where an agent is to be associated with each DM actor. This agent should have proactive capabilities for maintaining the extraction modalities. Another limitation is the use of dedicated scripts to generate RDF triples of the context KG, which adds barriers to integrating DM data sources using new technologies and data models. Alternatives to address this problem could explore the use of RDF Mapping Language (RML) rules [5]. They are based on a fully declarative approach for the KG generation process, which is adaptable to additional data sources [20]. This reduces integration costs.

This allows one to track the operation of vehicles or traffic systems in real-world scenar- ios. ;Also, using multi-dimensional and compre- hensive modeling, the server can help enhance sit- uation awareness, predict the feasibility of certain strategies, and facilitate decision-making.

Within the proposed platform, a software-based communication emulator is developed, which allows the investigation of the impact of communication latency and jitter on the performance of DTs of the DERs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of the developed DT prototyping process and testing platform to enable frequency control using the DTs, which provide valuable learnings and tools for enabling future DTs-based solutions.;A typical DT-based system consists of a number of key elements, i.e., the digital model in the virtual space (i.e., the DT itself), the hardware system being represented by the DT, the communication links between the DT and the physical system, the data to be communicated, and the services provided by the DT to support specific applications. The key defining difference between a DT and a conventional system model is the access and link with live measurement data to have real-time view of the system status. While DTs are typically considered as virtual replicas of physical systems, the digital models for DTs could only reflect a selected set of attributes such as electrical properties, geometry, heat or motion, depending on the targeted applications and design considerations (e.g., the computation power required);Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is considered as a promising solution for enhancing the visibility of a physical system, where only a limited set of data is required to be transmitted with the rest data of interest can be estimated via the DT.;Smart Grid;real time simulation,hardware-in-the-loop testing platform;Cloud;Distributed Energy Resources;The real-time measurement data (e.g., frequency, voltage, etc.) are transmitted via a Socket-based Giga-Transceiver Network (GTNET-SKT) card, which is a network interface in RTDS.

The current work looks into the cascading effects of attacks within a system, however, CPSs are usually not independent systems but are connected systems-of-systems (i.e. water treatment plant is connected to a water distribution network). Future research could focus on evaluating cascading effects of attacks on inter-connected systems.;Although the modeling approach may work well for a simple CPS such as SWaT, there might be challenges with modeling more complex and large scale CPS due to the increased inter-dependencies of subsystems and non-linear dynamics. This could potentially be resolved by using composition of smaller models of subsystems and using linear approximation for the non-linearity in dynamics. It remains as part of future work for the evaluation of the applicability of modeling approach on other CPSs (i.e. Electric Power Grid Systems where generators, switches/breakers and batteries are analogous to pumps, valves and tanks).

Holmes2021;HIGH;In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence. ;Broadly stated, a DT is a digitally determined model that unique depicts a physical instance, process, service, system, biologic or like abstraction. Gartner takes a broader view and defines a DT as a ?digital representation of a real- world entity or system?. Grieves is credited for coining the term to describe a digital informational construct based upon a physical system but created as an separate entity, where the digital construct should ideally be endowed with all informational assets as those found on the physical entity. Kitzinger et al. describe a DT as a concept that is capable of being further sub-divided into variants based upon their integration status, the particular area of focus and the technology employed.;The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems.;Smart Manufacturing;solution for a trusted internet of things;N/A;IoT Devices, CPS;N/A;DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;digital twin;N/A;N/A;Prediction, Analysis, Emulation, Monitoring;N/A;NO;To achieve the full benefits of DTs further research is needed to make the implementation of complex systems through a DT approach feasible and economical. ;We consider the main challenge to be the creation of DTs without increasing the cybersecurity risks for the real system. The answer lies in the technologies that help to create the realism of the physical systems without revealing the security-sensitive components, data and interactions. Existing technologies in the areas of deception and privacy-enhancing techniques may provide a good starting point, but may not be sufficient to provide a solution to the issue.

Hou2022;HIGH;The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we present a conceptual framework of a digital twin sys- tem specialised for satellites and space communications. We then present an efficient and secure communication protocol for maintaining state between the digital and physical twin.;The concept of a digital twin is the creation of a digital rep- resentation of a physical object, process or system. System and sensor data from the physical twin are sent to the digital twin to maintain the latter. The digital twin simulates the physical twin, analyses the outcomes of the simulations, determines the best course of action and then sends the commands necessary to undertake those actions back to the physical twin. The cycle of update, analyse and respond continues.;The advantage of the digital twin is that it allows the more powerful simulation and analysis tools to be deployed at the digital twin that may not have been able to be run on the physical twin alone. Digital twins can be used in single object systems and complex multiple node systems. This technology has mainly been used to optimise and maintain systems, so exploring the possibilities in runtime monitoring and verification for space assets is a new angle.;Airspace;security monitoring;Cloud;Satellite;The physical twin collects, monitors and interprets engineering data such as control and sensor raw data.

Once the final tests are passed, we plan to launch a test satellite with Gilmore Space Technologies in mid-2022.;NO;Our future plans include formally verifying the design and implementation of the digital twin system and the protocols using Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) [6]. Towards building an integrated system that combines required functionalities and verification tools, we propose implementing runtime monitor- ing and verification of the digital twin system using PAT as well. This way, we can minimise the overall system design and software development load. Therefore, this paper also develops a versatile runtime verification tool driven by PAT that can deal with multiple temporal logic languages. / The new simulation environment will reim- plement both the satellite and the digital twin, as well as their communication methods. Once the final tests are passed, we plan to launch a test satellite with Gilmore Space Technologies in mid-2022.;There are several challenges for digital twin systems. To be effective, the digital twin must be able to synchronise states with the physical twin. The digital twin simulation and analysis need to be such that there is enough bandwidth to transmit state data from the physical twin and enough processing power to ensure efficient simulations to ensure effective decisions can be made in a timely manner. Our proposed synchronisation protocol will help with this.
Jagannath2022ab;HIGH;We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the con- trol functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.;There are multitude of different, but similar, definitions for DT in the literature, reflecting adoption of DT in various research domains. A common definition of DT capturing most of the concepts used in various applications is ?a probabilistic simulation model for an as-built physical entity (sensor, device, system or process) that represents the properties (control and configuration capabilities), state (updates), conditions (interactions with the environment), and history of the entity in a way that mirrors its life and behavior?. A comprehensive list of definitions in different applications is given in [19]. In this paper, rather than the exact definition we elucidate the main characteristics and requirements of DTs. A DT is a unified high-fidelity simulation model that represents a physical entity in the past, present, and future. With respect to the past and the present, a DT in the virtual space mirrors the behavior of an entity in the physical space. Regarding the future, the DT predicts accurately the behavior of the entity which is sufficient for the control process. Further, the behavior of the entity in a simulated environment (which is not necessarily observed) can be inferred using the DT models for the purpose of policy exploration. Constructing a model with the above capabilities requires a bidi- rectional communication between the physical entity and the DT. The measurements are collected from the physical space, trans- ferred through the network, and consumed by DTs in real-time to update models, and potentially control policies. Control commands computed in the virtual space of DTs are also sent to the physical space through the network.;Digital twin (DT) technology addresses the interpretation of distributed data within a certain context.

Each newly introduced dynamic range has multiple associated attributes, including the time, the place, and the range of influence. Different dimensions supply the IDT with different control mechanisms and AI logic, which cannot be fully approximated in due time. Edge computing solutions must adapt to work in a real-time environment, decreasing the accuracy of the estimation transformed it into a wide and unpredicted range of impacts on the containers handling procedures. 
Khan2023;HIGH;The proposed approach takes advantage of the DT-based reference model as well as the physical characteristics of the radial distribution network to compute a new metric, namely Residual Rate of Change (RRC), which allows differentiating False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on load measurements and protective de- vices. The RRC enables the determination of the attack’s location by constructing a directed graph that characterizes the physical dependencies of protective devices. The proposed attack localiza- tion method is implemented on a testbed consisting of a digital real-time simulator, feeder protection devices, a real-time automa- tion controller, and advanced communication infrastructure for a power distribution system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to localize cyber attacks in various operation scenarios of the power distribution system.

Relay has to do continuous monitoring of electrical parameters, Internal or external fault detection and electrical data collection, and pre and post fault analysis. DGA has to continuously monitor single or multiple gas parameters. DGA helps in incipient fault detection. The amount of gas present in the oil gives the deterioration condition of the oil. Carbon paper of the insulation starts damaging due to failure or fault. Carbon mixes with oxygen in the oil to give carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Arcing in the transformer causes hydrogen to develop. Likewise, nine gases are identified. This gives can give an idea of external, internal, or incipient fault. Earlier relay looks into electrical data only, causing tripping. Today a communication channel is set up between the relay and DGA. When a relay detects a fault it will trip the transformer and will also send a communication message to DGA to check the oil sample. It analyses the condition of the transformer and pre-fault and post fault data are collected and analyzed for parts per million of the gas entrapped within the oil.

Lai2023;HIGH;Towards a secure and reliable ISTN for pervasive Internet services globally, we carry out our study in three steps. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the unique characteristics and new vulnerabilities of emerging ISTNs. Second, we envision space digital twin (SDT), a novel technology that can facilitate secure and reliable satellite Internet with the ability to conduct multidimensional security assessment, identify various vulnerabilities, and evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures accordingly. With SDT techniques, an ISTN operator/researcher can flexibly build a virtual ISTN environment (VIE), which duplicates the network architecture, protocols, behaviors as well as security threats and vulnerabilities of a real ISTN, for security assessment and countermeasures evaluation. Finally, we conclude the key challenges of realizing the full capability of SDT, and accordingly outline a list of corresponding new directions for future research;SDT bridges this gap by creating a virtual ISTN (i.e., a SDT network), which is a virtual presentation or digital replica of a physical ISTN for security assessment.;Each instance in the SDT network is a digital counterpart that mimics the corresponding realworld ISTN entity and provides a detailed representation of its characteristics, protocols, behaviors, interactions, as well as the potential vulnerabilities. SDT allows for better identifying, understanding and monitoring various ISTNs vulnerabilities or threats and enables a laboratory environment for the design and evaluation of countermeasures accordingly.

Lin2023c;HIGH;A Digital Twin Framework for Industry 4.0 Security. The DT4I4-Secure presents a framework to create Digital Twins (DT) for I4.0 systems using a combination of models (including physics and data-based models). This paper showcases the use of the DT framework to detect attacks on I4.0 systems by comparing observations with future predictions from the DT. This paper evaluates the performance of the DT4I4- Secure for a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) turning process manufacturing a metallic spool, wherein the experimental results show the model can predict normal operations with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.005081. This work also explores using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) based dynamic threshold instead of a traditional static threshold for attack detection when the CNC turning process is under three separate attack scenarios. The DT4I4-Secure combined with the dynamic threshold shows a 3.46 times improvement in F1-Scores over all three attack scenarios for instantaneous attack detection while having 100% accuracy during the manufacturing cycle.; We define Digital Twins as ”Software systems replicating the behavior of one or more physical processes using one or more behavior models” [4]–[6];N/A;Smart Manufacturing;attack detection, anomaly detection;Cloud;CNC turining process;CAD files,  parameters within G-Code, Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T);DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;digital twin;N/A;N/A;Analysis;N/A;YES;Our future work will use different physical quantities such as acoustics, vibrations, and temperature to create more complex and accurate DTs, employing data fusion from multiple models.

We model the behavior of the system in the Rebeca modeling language and use Afra model checker to generate the state space. The Tiny Twin is built automatically, by abstracting the state space while keeping the observable actions and preserving the trace equivalence. For doing that we had to solve the complexities in the state space introduced by time-shifts, nondeterministic assignments and abstraction of internal actions.

Nguyen2022abcde;HIGH;This paper presents a DT-based tool, called TaS, to easily test and simulate IoT environments. The objective is to improve the testing methodologies in IoT systems to evaluate the possible impact of it on the physical world. We provide the conditions to test, pre- dict errors and stress application depending on hardware, software and real world physical process. The tool is based on the DT concept in order to detect and pre- dict failures in evolving IoT environments. In particular, the way to prepare the DT to support fault injection and cybersecurity threats is analyzed. The TaS tool is tested through an industrial case study, the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) provided by the INDRA company. Results of experiments are presented that show that our DT is closely linked to the real world. / The main contribution of our paper is the design of a tool, called TaS (stands for Test and Simulation), based on the concept of Digital Twin, to simulate, test and predict errors in real IoT systems. The tool supports functional and non-functional testing through the real-time connection of the physical system to a new software version deployed in the DT. This way, it is possible to verify that the changes made in the code do not impact the existing software functionality. Also, the DT may be used to elaborate a what-if analysis resulting in a better evaluation of attacks, error cases, scalability and performance stress situations. For example, it is possible to perturb the system to test unexpected scenarios and analyze the response. TaS has been validated through different experiments performed in the context of H2020 ENACT project 3 .;A DT is composed of a virtual object that models a physical component. Both components exchange information and the virtual object continually adapts to operational changes based on the collected data from the physical component.;The connection between the physical and virtual objects can forecast the future of the physical component using the collected data [19]. This way, DTs supply a system with information and operating status providing capabilities to create new business models and decision support systems. Also, it is possible to make more accurate predictions and information-based decisions using analytic, pre- dictive diagnosis, and performance optimization. Other uses of DT include re- ducing costs and risks, improving efficiency, security and resilience. / The DTs are a development of modelling and simulation technology.

The Data Storage stores all the generated data for further use.;YES;But still test generation can be improved to cover relevant test scenarios accord- ing to defined objectives (e.g., functional testing, regression testing, performance or security testing etc.). The automation of this task will allow to reduce the time of testing the target system as well as improving its coverage. In the same way, an analysis of real system traces and logs can be used to auto- mate its model building. This reverse engineering task is a complex task that can be also explored as an enhancement of TaS tool.;The main issue regarding simulators is that they are not directly linked to the real environment and any evolution of this latter (e.g., addition or deletion of a new IoT device or gateway) is not automatically taken into account in the sim- ulation mode. Also, physical process dynamics may be hard to be reproduced in simulations. As a result, physical properties and events, such as process dis- turbances or devices failure, may not be quantified during the software testing process. Besides, simulation can rely on predefined scenarios that can have dif- ferent behaviours in real environments since simulation is based on the abstrac- tion of some layers. The continuous monitoring of real systems is needed to feed simulators in order to have more accurate results. In addition, recommendations from simulators can be taken into account in the real world if a bidirectional re- lationship between these two worlds exist. This is exactly the essence of Digital Twins. / But still test generation can be improved to cover relevant test scenarios accord- ing to defined objectives (e.g., functional testing, regression testing, performance or security testing etc.).

A further example is the assessment of the most appropriate counter measures to preserve safe plant operation or at least securely shut down the parts of the plants under attack. ;The current method fails to manage some practical issues, which must be looked at more closely in future development. Firstly, there is no cyclic state update from the real process, as this communication channel would have to be secured against any manipulation to not compromise the digital twin itself. This is fine if only batch processes, like in the example plant, are considered, where initial conditions can be reset for each batch. Secondly, the scalability of the root cause analysis is currently only guaranteed for the signal dependencies in the field and process level, as the simulation model is based on a type- instance concept. The analysis of the PLC code is currently not systematized.

Sen2022a;HIGH;this paper addresses the investigation of the impact and manifestations of cyberattacks on smart grids by replicating the power grid in a secure, isolated, and controlled laboratory environment as a cyber-physical twin. Currently, detecting intrusions by unauthorized third parties into the central monitoring and control system of grid operators, especially attacks within the grid perimeter, is a major challenge. The development and validation of methods to detect and prevent coordinated and timed attacks on electric power systems depends not only on the availability and quality of data from such attack scenarios, but also on suitable realistic investigation environments. However, to create a comprehensive investigation environment, a realistic representation of the study object is required to thoroughly investigate critical cyberattacks on grid operations and evaluate their impact on the power grid using real data.

Suhail2023;HIGH;To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’ security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions.

A step-by-step approach is as follows. The process starts with configuring the vehicle’s ECUs and communicating with the CAN bus. Three sensors, i.e., speedometer, indicator, and coolant are then installed on respective ECUs positions to emit data to the vehicle DT. The sensor devices are registered on the Azure IoT Hub and are authenticated using Shared Access Signatures (SAS) token authentication (Microsoft, 2023). The Azure IoT Hub receives data from the sensors through the CAN bus. To route the data to the vehicle DT, the event grid is used that allows subscription to an Azure function. The Azure function acts as an on-demand compute functionality, serving as a data ingestion, transformation, and feeder to the DT. The Azure function receives the data and transforms it into JSON format using JsonPatchDocument (Fig. A.7), which is readable by the vehicle DT. The information gathered by the Azure function is then used to update the vehicle DT. Finally, the ADT explorer allows users to explore the twins in a graphical view to visualize and interact with the DT and the data streams received from the sensors (Fig. C.9). The ADT explorer loads the vehicle DT using the ADT instance URL.;YES;Hybrid attack scenarios. Engaging gameplay. Realism. .Adaptive gamification. ENIGMA’s platform can be further explored to realize the vision of Industry 5.0. However, in order to consider proactive security for CPS, variable fidelity is essential.;However, the presented validation must be generalized across datasets from different domains. Third, to demonstrate the generation and collection of sensor data (indicator, speedometer, coolant) of the prototype, we rely on Azure IoT Hub, which acts as a common source for device data to be used in ADT (Microsoft, 2022). However, in practical settings, such data collected from real operating devices can be ingested into ADT through the Azure function. Thus, without conducting experiments that require a complicated setup, including a real system generating real-time data, free access to the services of the simulator, and setting up the connection between the twin and its physical counterpart, we cannot draw a solid conclusion

Wei2022;MEDIUM;This study develops a combined anomaly detection framework (CADF) against various types of security attacks on the digital twin of process control in water treatment facilities. CADF utilizes the PLC-based whitelist system to detect anomalies that target the actuators and the deep learning approach of natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) and probabilistic assessment to detect anomalies that target the sensors. The effectiveness of CADF is verified using a physical facility for water treatment with membrane processes called the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system in the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Various attack scenarios are tested in SWaT by falsifying the reported values of sensors and actuators in the digital twin process. These scenarios include both trivial attacks, which are commonly studied, as well as non-trivial (i.e., sophisticated) attacks, which are rarely reported. The results show that CADF performs very well with good detection accuracy in all scenarios, and particularly, it is able to detect all sophisticated attacks while ongoing before they can induce damage to the water treatment facility. CADF can be further extended to other cyber-physical systems in the future.;Subsequently, the digital twin?s behavior can be established based on a combination of dynamic and data-driven methods for various objectives, including to safeguard the physical asset as well as to optimize the operations in order to minimize the consumption of energy and materials [7]. Overall, the implementation of a digital twin as a digital replica of the physical asset has matured significantly over the last decade with the advancement of digital technologies that enable fast data synchronization among sensors and actuators within the asset [8,9].;N/A;Water System;anomaly detection;N/A;Pump, Tank, Static Mixer, Filter, UV system, Drain;SWaT is designed to support the research on cyber-physical systems with 68 connected sensors and actuators in total to monitor the entire treatment process above.

This level covers all three dimensions of integration.

Xiao2022;LOW;In this paper, we proposed CommandFence, a novel preven- tive framework to secure smart home systems from reaching risky states when app commands combined human activities and environmental variations are executed. CommandFence is based on digital-twin, a new concept that is fundamentally different than those employed by the existing well-received access control frameworks. It is composed of an Interposition Layer and an Emulation Layer to first interpose the app commands and then execute them in a virtual smart home en- vironment that can predict whether the operations of the com- mands combining with human activities and environmental variations may transition a normal smart home environment to a dangerous one, and if yes, the commands are dropped before they are sent to the real smart home system. / Our Contributions. The major contributions are listed as follows: ? We proposed CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based preventive framework to defend against the threats caused by malicious apps with evil intentions as well as benign ones with design flaws or logical errors that may harm a smart home environment when being executed and inter- acting with human activities and environmental changes. CommandFence is built on a fundamentally new idea, i.e., digital-twin, and is orthogonal to the well-received permission-based access control mechanisms, but it can capture the app commands that may lead the smart home environment to a risky state when being executed and drop them before any insecure situation can appear. ? We implemented our proposed CommandFence frame- work and trained the DQN with 232,315 pieces of sensing data collected from two real smart home environments. We tested our implementation on 553 official SmartApps 1 on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 erroneous ones, among which 31 were reported to be problematic the first time to our best knowledge, which may cause a risky situation due to care- less implementations 2 . We then tested our implementation against the 10 pure evil SmartApps created by [1], and CommandFence labeled 7 of them as risky, with the rest 3 being missed because they are not harmful to the smart home system but only cause smartphone information leaks. We also tested our implementation against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors [2] and achieved 100% success rates of flagging them as risky. Finally, we measured the latency of CommandFence and found that adopting our implementation incurred a neglectable delay of 0.1675 seconds.;N/A;N/A;Smart Home;attack detection, attack prevention;Embedded;Smart Home devices, such as smoke sensor, temp sensor, humidity sensor, light sensor, sound sensor, flame sensor, motion sensor;app commands;DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;digital twin;Wifi, Bluetooth;DQN, VirtualApp, YAHFA, C/C++, Python;Simulation, Analysis, Monitoring;The main hooking process is shown as follows. First, VirtualApp substitutes the original BinderProxy with BinderProvider, which contains all core An- droid system components. Second, every time a hooked Android app launches a function call, the request would be replaced by StubActivity proxied at VirtualApp, which then for- wards the request to BinderProvider and registers a corresponding callback function. Third, YAHFA is attached to the VirtualApp process, and checks if the function is a target function to be hooked (called originMethod in YAHFA) based on the hook plugin. Then it copies the target function codes for execution. Fourth, if YAHFA finds that an originMethod should be hooked, it makes a backup for this function (called backupMethod in YAHFA), then changes the entry point entry_point_from_jni_ of originMethod to the one of the hook function, i.e., the injected function (called hookMethod in YAHFA). Last, YAHFA changes the entry of the assembly codes entry_point_from_quick_compiled_code_ of the originMethod to the one of the hookMethod.;YES;A feasible approach is to implement (hardware and software) a standalone voltage interceptor and place it between the PLCs and the routers. Then whenever a PLC emits a voltage signal, the interceptor can intercept the signal and direct it to the Emulation Layer for further analysis. To implement the Emulation Layer, we need to first develop a program reversing the voltage back to some human-readable languages such as ladder diagram, instruction language, function block diagram, or sequential function chart, which would be interpreted as commands. We then need to implement a digital-twin version of the IIoT system which should include as many digital actuators as possible, e.g., sensors, relays, motors, servos, CNC machines. Lastly, we can execute the commands in the digital-twin environment and employ learning algorithms to complete different tasks such as active defense, fault diagnosis [64], vulnerability identification and accident avoidance. One can see that the overall migration process to IIoT requires tremendous efforts to accomplish. Nevertheless, the potential of exploiting digital twin to develop defense mechanisms for more complicated systems such as IIoT is definitely worthy of exploration.;its current design can only deal with threats from the smart home apps installed in a user?s smartphone, while in practice threats may come from other sources including remote attackers from the external environments. Therefore, we will consider the design of defensive mechanisms embedded into smart devices, endowing them with the capabilities to hinder attacks from all sources. On the other hand, the detection accuracy and false-alarm rate of CommandFence could be further improved if we can collect more training data from a broader range of scenarios and employ the recently developed advanced reinforcement learning techniques to cope with the more complicated variations including those that are not human-related.

Xu2023f;HIGH;Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel method named KDDT for TCMS anomaly detection. KDDT harnesses a language model (LM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract contexts and chronological features, respectively. To enrich data volume, KDDT benefits from out-ofdomain data with knowledge distillation (KD). We evaluated KDDT with two datasets from our industry partner Alstom and obtained the F1 scores of 0.931 and 0.915, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of KDDT. We also explored individual contributions of the DT model, LM, and KD to the overall performance of KDDT, via a comprehensive empirical study, and observed average F1 score improvements of 12.4%, 3%, and 6.05%, respectively;Specifically, a DT can be considered as a digital replica of a CPS and enables rich functionalities with this replica instead of the real CPS;However, training these methods involves collecting abundant data from RWS, which might interfere with the safe operation of RWS.

Moreover, we propose an intelligent attack detection mechanism to handle different attack types using DT technology for internal attacks.

Zhao2022b;HIGH;The idea of this paper is motivated by the limitations of cyber security in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). We introduce an efficient synchronization approach to maintain state between virtual environment and the physical environment. In this case, we can receive prompt feedback from conducting security analysis in the virtual domain. Thus, helping to enhance the cyber security of CPSs, we propose a digital twin-based framework. Based on the approach, the security of the CPSs can be protected by the digital twin system. Moreover, the proposed architecture has also been optimized to meet the security requirements and maintain less network burden for CPSs;However, a digital twin system could be a possibly solve this problem. A digital twin can be considered a virtual replica of its physical counterpart. It could run independently in a virtual environment.;In this case, operators could conduct security tests and analyse security manners without taking the risk to interfere with the physical domain.

Zhou2022abcde;MEDIUM;in this paper, we propose a framework for a digital twin based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.;Digital Twin was first mentioned as a concept in a product life management class in 2002[6]. The detail of the digital twin is not the same when applied to dif- ferent domains. In general, digital twins can be referred to as a presentation of the physical space?s real-world assets in virtual space. Conceptually, in their whole life cycle, the virtual twin changes dynamically along with the physical twin. They communicate in dual direc- tions, unlike similar concepts such as the static digital models and digital shadows, which communicate in a single direction. There is a conclusion[7] that the digital twin, in the narrow sense, solves the problem of how to simulate the physical products realistically, in a broad sense, the digital twin is an integrated system that can simulate, monitor, calculate, regulate, and control the system status and processes. / However, some researchers[9] hold an opinion that the visual part of the virtual twin is not necessary as long as the system is capable of dealing with the data from the real world and interacts with the physical twin, considering a broad concept of a digital twin;There is a conclusion[7] that the digital twin, in the narrow sense, solves the problem of how to simulate the physical products realistically, in a broad sense, the digital twin is an integrated system that can simulate, monitor, calculate, regulate, and control the system status and processes.;Smart Manufacturing;training;Edge;CPS, PLCs;The data model is mainly built logically. The data that are reachable from the sensors and available for PLC to transmit on IIoT communica- tion protocols need to be figured out. Nevertheless, in general, all data are not valuable for a specific service. Therefore, the data screening methods could be used in this stage. After the collection, the data from the field devices are stored in a SQL SERVER database. The data are critical because they are needed to train the digital model in the service part to predicate the temperature value in our metering station if the heat control parameter is changed. The data are read on Modbus/TCP from PLC to virtual space. While all the data available from PLC are collected, as the pilot scenario is relatively simpler than the reality, only the features related to the temper are used by judgment in our data model, including the control parameter of heating power, the on and off of the cooling devices and so on.;DIGITAL_PHYSICAL, DIGITAL_EXPERT;digital twin;Modbus/TCP, OPC, OPC UA, MQTT, S7comm, S7comm-plus;MATLAB/SIMULINK, Tecnomatrix Plant Simulation, unity3D,;Simulation;Up to now, in our physical space, a petrochemical metering station, which is used to measure the flow rate of oil at various locations in real industries to monitor the performance of pipelines, has been established in our lab, as Figure 4 shows and there is an emulated scenario where there are some heaters simulated for controlling the temperature of the produced oil, a fan used to cool down the oil when it is too hot, a tempera- ture sensor used to send the measured value to the PLC in the real environment, and some other devices. The process is implemented in our Unity3D scene, where the assets work like the real ones. Figure 5 shows the real devices in the oil temperature control scenario, and their virtual geometry and behavior models are shown in Figure 6.;YES;The corresponding fitting error is shown in Figure 7. Although some individual fitting errors are relatively significant, the fitting errors ranging from -0.1 to 0.06 are really small, generally speaking. The fluctuation might be related to improper operations during data generation and collection and needs to be handled dur-ing training. Therefore, some optimization is needed and necessary in future work. For another, it is to learn the trend of how tem- perature changes under the control of specific heating power control parameters through training with his- torical data. At first, the parameter is set to a fixed value, which can be a common value in the actual factory, and it is assumed that the entire control logic is to control the temperature within a specific range. When the temperature is too low, heat up, and if the temperature is too high, cool off.;However, concerning the widely accepted concep- tion of a digital twin, the limitations of our system are obvious. For one thing, our digital twin relies com- pletely on the machine learning model, which means that in some cases, such as device breaking down, which is uncommon in real work, and other extreme scenarios avoided from happening, the historical data hardly satisfy the need for machine learning. Thus, the effort of simulating the system on the physical layer, such as a heat convey formulation and analysis is required, which will be studied in the future. Moreover, the evolvement of the prediction model has not been implemented even though the changes in real devices are tiny, and this will be our future work as well.
