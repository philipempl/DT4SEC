We need to define a similar concept forhigh level guidance which will be applicable to variousscenarios and contexts in a general way. The semantics tobe used for high-level guidance needs to be defined. Whilethat semantics can be defined for each of the different generationapproaches discussed in Section 3, an open challengeremains that of identifying the abstraction that will createthe concept of the high level guidance that will be applicableto a broad set of use-case scenarios regardless of theapproach used to generate policies.(2) Defining the right discovery process: Generating the rightaccess control policy requires each of the resources in theenvironment to be aware of the other devices in the environment.Given the lack of widely adopted standards fordiscovery of resources, and the many security exposuresthat may result from a flawed discovery process, new discoverytechniques that can provide sufficient security in manydynamic contexts are needed.(3) Determining the situational context: The definition of thesituational context, as well as its determination, remainsa hard and open research challenge. Access control needsto account for not only the other resources that any givenresource interacts with, but also for the resources that mayindirectly use the information provided by that resource.Understanding the situation on the ground in sufficient detailto provide workable security is a challenge that can be solvedon a case-by-case basis, but a general formulation remainsan open challenge.(4) Policy deconfliction without human guidance: When accesscontrol policies are generated by the resources, they mayconflict among themselves, or with other policies that areimposed on the system to meet other requirements, suchas performance, reliability or availability requirements. Inthe presence of a human, such conflicts can be resolved anddeconflicted using the human provided input. Similar algorithms,which can operate without a human in the loop, needto be developed.(5) Controlling emergent behavior: When resources create theirown policies, there is a danger of uncontrolled emergentbehavior [15]. Emergent behavior is behavior shown by acollection of systems which was not originally designed buthappens due to the dynamic interactions among different intelligentsystems. Such emergent behavior can be controlled,but the design needs to account for that. The control ofemergent behavior in complete generality remains an openchallenge, but there may be solutions that can be developedfor specific domain of access control.(6) Learning-related challenges: The approach used by resourcesto learn their access control policy has to use some type oflearning approach, which creates a generalization based onits past experiences, but such learning mechanism has itschallenges. The set of experiences for access control in eachuse-case has only a few small data points to draw from,which means that either existing learning techniques thatuse only a few data points need to be used, or new learningtechniques requiring small data for training needs to be actor may manipulate the data so as to force the device tolearn an invalid model which could lead to generation ofinsecure access control policies. Solutions to such adversariallearning in uncontrolled environments need to be developed.(7) Increase in attack surface. The increase in complexity dueto autonomous generation of policies by devices can leadto new types of security vulnerabilities and threats, e.g. theadversarial learning example given above. This could lead tochallenges with established assurance processes in enterpriseand government networks, and the right way to provideassurance for systems using dynamically generated accesscontrol policies need to be developed.(8) Power, computation and communication efficiency. While inthe past several years there have been tremendous advantagesin the computational capacity of small devices, devicesthat need to learn and manage their own policies may findthemselves unable to use approaches that require specializedhardware, or significant computational power, e.g. learningmechanisms based on deep neural networks. For any solutiondeveloped with dynamic access control policies, systemdesign should incorporate mechanisms that take into accountthe limitations on a resource, which usually manifestsitself as limited amount of battery power, computationalcapacity or the ability to communicate at high bandwidthrates."

In this case,users are required to either add details about stimuli or explicitlylabel inputs as stimuli. Another possible option, yet more complexto implement, may be to develop a code analyzer that automaticallyinspects all programs, which are referenced in a CPS’s specification,for the purpose of stimuli identification. Furthermore, as ourapproach focuses only on states of software programs, support forreplicating stimuli that manifest themselves in the form of analogsignals is lacking. Thus, analog values that constitute stimuli mustbe converted to a binary representation, before they can be replicatedin the virtual environment.
