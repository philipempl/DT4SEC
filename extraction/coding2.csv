In addition, we plan to extend the solution to support different pricing strategies
for the various implementations, such as software bundles with contribution
margin-based pricing. We also plan to (1) add new types of constraints, e.g.,
constraints that take the physical space available within the digital twin that
will be implemented (e.g., a small room or an open space) into account; (2)
consider implementations of multiple elements as virtual or simulations on the
same machine; and (3) handle identical setups in an industrial environment
(e.g., if two similar production lines are implemented, there is no need to test
both of them). Finally, a general knowledge base of possible tests and their test

Calo2018;LOW;In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed.;N/A;The devices can use such a model to determine whether or not they should allow access to any resource or service that is being requested of them.;Enterprise/ Organization;Device Model Control Approach;Embedded;IoT Device;States depending on sensor data (unsafe/safe);DIGITAL_PHYSICAL;DIGITAL_TWIN;N/A;N/A;Simulation;device state model;NO;N/A;"Defining the right “high-level guidance”:Access control policies

the application of access control mechanisms to a divergent

set of use-cases. We need to define a similar concept for
“high level guidance” which will be applicable to various
scenarios and contexts in a general way. The semantics to
be used for high-level guidance needs to be defined. While
that semantics can be defined for each of the different generation
approaches discussed in Section 3, an open challenge
remains that of identifying the abstraction that will create
the concept of the “high level guidance” that will be applicable
to a broad set of use-case scenarios regardless of the
approach used to generate policies.
(2) Defining the right discovery process: Generating the right
access control policy requires each of the resources in the
environment to be aware of the other devices in the environment.
Given the lack of widely adopted standards for
discovery of resources, and the many security exposures
that may result from a flawed discovery process, new discovery
techniques that can provide sufficient security in many
dynamic contexts are needed.
(3) Determining the situational context: The definition of the
situational context, as well as its determination, remains
a hard and open research challenge. Access control needs
to account for not only the other resources that any given
resource interacts with, but also for the resources that may
indirectly use the information provided by that resource.
Understanding the situation on the ground in sufficient detail
to provide workable security is a challenge that can be solved
on a case-by-case basis, but a general formulation remains
an open challenge.
(4) Policy deconfliction without human guidance: When access
control policies are generated by the resources, they may
conflict among themselves, or with other policies that are
imposed on the system to meet other requirements, such
as performance, reliability or availability requirements. In
the presence of a human, such conflicts can be resolved and
deconflicted using the human provided input. Similar algorithms,
which can operate without a human in the loop, need
to be developed.
(5) Controlling emergent behavior: When resources create their
own policies, there is a danger of uncontrolled emergent
behavior [15]. Emergent behavior is behavior shown by a
collection of systems which was not originally designed but
happens due to the dynamic interactions among different intelligent
systems. Such emergent behavior can be controlled,
but the design needs to account for that. The control of
emergent behavior in complete generality remains an open
challenge, but there may be solutions that can be developed
for specific domain of access control.
(6) Learning-related challenges: The approach used by resources
to learn their access control policy has to use some type of
learning approach, which creates a generalization based on
its past experiences, but such learning mechanism has its
challenges. The set of experiences for access control in each
use-case has only a few small data points to draw from,
which means that either existing learning techniques that
use only a few data points need to be used, or new learning
techniques requiring small data for training needs to be actor may manipulate the data so as to force the device to
learn an invalid model which could lead to generation of
insecure access control policies. Solutions to such adversarial
learning in uncontrolled environments need to be developed.
(7) Increase in attack surface. The increase in complexity due
to autonomous generation of policies by devices can lead
to new types of security vulnerabilities and threats, e.g. the
adversarial learning example given above. This could lead to
challenges with established assurance processes in enterprise
and government networks, and the right way to provide
assurance for systems using dynamically generated access
control policies need to be developed.
(8) Power, computation and communication efficiency. While in
the past several years there have been tremendous advantages
in the computational capacity of small devices, devices
that need to learn and manage their own policies may find
themselves unable to use approaches that require specialized
hardware, or significant computational power, e.g. learning
mechanisms based on deep neural networks. For any solution
developed with dynamic access control policies, system
design should incorporate mechanisms that take into account
the limitations on a resource, which usually manifests
itself as limited amount of battery power, computational
capacity or the ability to communicate at high bandwidth
rates."

Especially the incorporation of heterogeneous data requires further  progress.  For  instance,  the  standardization  in  data acquisition needs to be accelerated. Also, issues with real-time data have to be focused on. For instance, the manual acquisition of real-time data has to be automated  to  enable  the  collection  of  full  historical  data instead of snapshots. Another great technical burden is the current decentralization. Interfaces, connections and the like need to be developed to enable a more holistic approach. Moreover, security concerns have to  be  addressed.  This  includes  version  management  and compatibility  checks  of  the  DT  versions  to  ensure  data integrity  as  well  as  access  management  to  allow  third parties to access (parts of) the virtual twin. At different levels, corporate challenges remain. While operational  challenges  mostly  overlap  with  the  technical challenges, the DT potentially implies major economic and organizational  transformations  at  a  strategic  level.  The strategic decision of DT implementation focuses on but is not  limited  to  the  degree  of  asset-centralization  of  an organization. 
The degree of reflecting the real-world  asset  varies  depending  on  the  use  case.  Consequently, this poses yet another corporate challenge in terms of  depth  of  detail  and  granularity.  Moreover,  the  study indicates  that  at  present,  the  term  ‘‘Digital  Twin’’  can  be misleading as it is applied for slightly different phenomena in  different  areas. Entangled with  the  complexity  of  DTs,  a  further  strategic  decision bases on the tradeoff between the cost of an asset versus the cost  of  the  DT  and  its  data  granularity  (e.g.  by  including sensors). However, with the general decrease in storage and sensor  cost,  the implementation  of  DTs  tends  to  become more  attractive.  Moreover,  the  emergence  of  novel business  models, including such where the organization does not possess  the asset but provides the service of establishing a DT, will  entail major privacy issues – including the question of ownership of the virtual counterpart";Although  first  assumptions  about  the  effects  of  DTs exist, future research should analyze the concrete technical and  corporate  implications.  One  impact  of  DTs  concerns the  improvement  in  interconnectivity,  especially  within supply  chains,  where  research  should  not  be limited  to  a single  firm’s  perspective  but  rather  take  a  system-of-systems  approach.  Another  potential  for  enterprises  is  the closure  of  feedback  loops  along  and  the  coherent  linkage between the lifecycle phases of the asset.

Currently,  very  little  is  known  about potential data-driven business models, their power of digital  disruptiveness  and  pricing  strategies  for  DT  services.

modules. As we admit in the introduction, data is vital to generate
wisdom. By bundling the data sources and types of data (stream
vs batch) required to fulfil a particular capability module (e.g., the
descriptive module takes batch data), analytical techniques can be
instantiated. Thus, each capability module should be represented by
one virtual machine. The virtual machines can be interconnected
with dedicated bridges to accomplish the dependencies between
the capability modules. Each of the virtual machines is running
on Docker to establish containerized and modular applications.
There are many open-source software and tools for security analytics
applications that need to be categorized depending on their
functionality, e.g., Suricata is an intrusion detection tool and is,
therefore, available in the detective module. In this context, the
security analytics repository is considered a collection of dockerized
applications. Besides provisioning dockerized applications, the
security analytics repositories need to yield connectors for each
application to bind multiple applications’ sinks and sources. Additionally,
machine learning models can be shared across the security
analytics repository and integrated into the desired capability module.
Those machine learning models might be integrated into the
predictive module (stream data) and the descriptive module (batch
data). The different analytical techniques can be tagged inside the

by other users. These mechanisms are resulting in transparency as
to which methods are successfully contributing to the cybersecurity";"(Besides the contribution, this paper exhibits two limitations. First,

more performance evaluations on different platform, with

intrusion detection at the boarder to the virtual domain. It
is left for future research to design and integrate intrusion
detection in a fully working system.

access control in the virtual domain. The main advantage
with this approach is that this can be supported without
affecting the production domain at all. It remains
to design and evaluate this approach in a full system

Maher2018;LOW;We discuss a high-level model for software applications and services that can support a minimal set of human-centric trust management capabilities. We outline the unique set of challenges we must address if we are to attain a level of trust that will be required for a robust deployment of an IoT. We discuss the role of standards and how we can maximize the effectiveness of standards and device and service certification. We suggest a set of solutions for trust management that can support the unique security, safety, and privacy requirements of a robust IoT ;a virtual digital copy stored in the cloud or at a service point;and we can make the direct to device interaction model even simpler by using the “digital twin” concept whereby many interactions with the IoT device can be performed via an interaction with a virtual digital copy stored in the cloud or at a service point accessible to both the cloud and the device (gateway).

A further example is the assessment of the most appropriate counter measures to preserve safe plant operation or at least securely shut down the parts of the plants under attack. 

";The current method fails to manage some practical issues, which must be looked at more closely in future development. Firstly, there is no cyclic state update from the real process, as this communication channel would have to be secured against any manipulation to not compromise the digital twin itself. This is fine if only batch processes, like in the example plant, are considered, where initial conditions can be reset for each batch. Secondly, the scalability of the root cause analysis is currently only guaranteed for the signal dependencies in the field and process level, as the simulation model is based on a type- instance concept. The analysis of the PLC code is currently not systematized. Thirdly, it must be evaluated how the whole approach can still work under a manipulation of the digital twin itself or how the twin can be secured against attacks.

a digital twin is a formal digital representation of some asset, process or system that captures attributes and behaviors of that entity suitable for communication, storage, interpretation or processing within a certain context

The real advantage of Digital Twins relies in its fusion with other technologies, like Artificial Intelligence (AI), for enhanced security analysis or to support Decision Sup- port Systems (DSS).

Suhail2021b;MEDIUM;We discuss the applicability of the proposed framework for the automotive industry as a CPS use case. Finally, we identify the open challenges that impede the implementation of intelligence-driven architectures in CPSs. ;DTs are virtual replicas of physical systems that mirror every facet of a product or process and can provide actionable insights through monitoring, optimization, and prediction ;"In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) are revolutionizing the CPSs.

";"it necessitates methodological and theoretical solutions to address longstanding challenges. For instance, 
being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, DTs share commonalities in implementation and operational behavior. Due to this fact, DTs may act as a source of data breach, leading to the abuse case of DTs where attackers may launch covert attacks on the physical system by exploiting the valuable system knowledge available through DTs. For example, attackers may sabotage the system by manipulating DTs data such that the physical counterpart may not indicate data inconsistencies. Attacks instigated through DTs may have similar repercussions as that of directly attacking real field devices. 
DTs must exhibit sufficient fidelity to protect against failures of the real CPS. However, uncertain scenarios may occur due to the dynamism and complexity of underlying (sub) systems, for instance, machinery malfunctioning, hidden vulnerabilities, erroneous data, knowledge gaps, etc. This problem may raise the question: how accurately DTs are required to follow the states of their physical counterparts
On the one hand, due to the black-box nature of AI models, the decisions made by the resulting systems suffer from a loss of transparency and comprehensibility, hence leading to a negative impact on the system’s trustworthiness. However, on the other hand, complete transparency into the inner working of AI models may expose them to adversarial attacks by allowing them to make inferences from live cyber data or executing model poisoning into the training workflows. Attackers may begin with AI reconnaissance (i.e., observe the model’s behavior and learn the decision logic or knowledge bases to morph the malicious payloads) and, without being detected, can feed their adversarial data to launch data exfiltration attacks.
