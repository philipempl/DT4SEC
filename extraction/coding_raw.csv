Calo2018,LOW,"In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed.",N/A,The devices can use such a model to determine whether or not they should allow access to any resource or service that is being requested of them.,Enterprise Organization,access control,Embedded,IoT Device,States depending on sensor data (unsafe/safe),DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,digital twin,N/A,N/A,Simulation,device state model,NO,N/A,"Defining the right ?high-level guidance?:Access control policies were introduced as the general approach for simplifying the application of access control mechanisms to a divergent Blue Sky Session: Next Generation Security Services for Emerging Networks SACMAT?18, June 13-15, 2018, Indianapolis, IN, USA4 set of use-cases. We need to define a similar concept for ?high level guidance? which will be applicable to various scenarios and contexts in a general way. The semantics to be used for high-level guidance needs to be defined. While that semantics can be defined for each of the different generation approaches discussed in Section 3, an open challenge remains that of identifying the abstraction that will create the concept of the ?high level guidance? that will be applicable to a broad set of use-case scenarios regardless of the approach used to generate policies. (2) Defining the right discovery process: Generating the right access control policy requires each of the resources in the environment to be aware of the other devices in the environment. Given the lack of widely adopted standards for discovery of resources, and the many security exposures that may result from a flawed discovery process, new discovery techniques that can provide sufficient security in many dynamic contexts are needed. (3) Determining the situational context: The definition of the situational context, as well as its determination, remains a hard and open research challenge. Access control needs to account for not only the other resources that any given resource interacts with, but also for the resources that may indirectly use the information provided by that resource. Understanding the situation on the ground in sufficient detail to provide workable security is a challenge that can be solved on a case-by-case basis, but a general formulation remains an open challenge. (4) Policy deconfliction without human guidance: When access control policies are generated by the resources, they may conflict among themselves, or with other policies that are imposed on the system to meet other requirements, such as performance, reliability or availability requirements. In the presence of a human, such conflicts can be resolved and deconflicted using the human provided input. Similar algorithms, which can operate without a human in the loop, need to be developed. (5) Controlling emergent behavior: When resources create their own policies, there is a danger of uncontrolled emergent behavior [15]. Emergent behavior is behavior shown by a collection of systems which was not originally designed but happens due to the dynamic interactions among different intelligent systems. Such emergent behavior can be controlled, but the design needs to account for that. The control of emergent behavior in complete generality remains an open challenge, but there may be solutions that can be developed for specific domain of access control. (6) Learning-related challenges: The approach used by resources to learn their access control policy has to use some type of learning approach, which creates a generalization based on its past experiences, but such learning mechanism has its challenges. The set of experiences for access control in each use-case has only a few small data points to draw from, which means that either existing learning techniques that use only a few data points need to be used, or new learning techniques requiring small data for training needs to be actor may manipulate the data so as to force the device to learn an invalid model which could lead to generation of insecure access control policies. Solutions to such adversarial learning in uncontrolled environments need to be developed. (7) Increase in attack surface. The increase in complexity due to autonomous generation of policies by devices can lead to new types of security vulnerabilities and threats, e.g. the adversarial learning example given above. This could lead to challenges with established assurance processes in enterprise and government networks, and the right way to provide assurance for systems using dynamically generated access control policies need to be developed. (8) Power, computation and communication efficiency. While in the past several years there have been tremendous advantages in the computational capacity of small devices, devices that need to learn and manage their own policies may find themselves unable to use approaches that require specialized hardware, or significant computational power, e.g. learning mechanisms based on deep neural networks. For any solution developed with dynamic access control policies, system design should incorporate mechanisms that take into account the limitations on a resource, which usually manifests itself as limited amount of battery power, computational capacity or the ability to communicate at high bandwidth rates."

Especially the incorporation of heterogeneous data requires further  progress.  For  instance,  the  standardization  in  data acquisition needs to be accelerated. Also, issues with real-time data have to be focused on. For instance, the manual acquisition of real-time data has to be automated  to  enable  the  collection  of  full  historical  data instead of snapshots. Another great technical burden is the current decentralization. Interfaces, connections and the like need to be developed to enable a more holistic approach. Moreover, security concerns have to  be  addressed.  This  includes  version  management  and compatibility  checks  of  the  DT  versions  to  ensure  data integrity  as  well  as  access  management  to  allow  third parties to access (parts of) the virtual twin. At different levels, corporate challenges remain. While operational  challenges  mostly  overlap  with  the  technical challenges, the DT potentially implies major economic and organizational  transformations  at  a  strategic  level.  The strategic decision of DT implementation focuses on but is not  limited  to  the  degree  of  asset-centralization  of  an organization. The degree of reflecting the real-world  asset  varies  depending  on  the  use  case.  Consequently, this poses yet another corporate challenge in terms of  depth  of  detail  and  granularity.

Currently,  very  little  is  known  about potential data-driven business models, their power of digital  disruptiveness  and  pricing  strategies  for  DT  services.

The design of a specific implementation can be structured in several ways.We recommend a design based on virtual machines, dockerized applications, and specific connectors for a straightforward adoption and application of the capability modules.

By bundling the data sources and types of data (stream vs batch) required to fulfil a particular capability module (e.g., the descriptive module takes batch data), analytical techniques can be instantiated. Thus, each capability module should be represented by one virtual machine. The virtual machines can be interconnected with dedicated bridges to accomplish the dependencies between the capability modules. Each of the virtual machines is running on Docker to establish containerized and modular applications.

Jagannath2022ab,HIGH,"We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes.

To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.","There are multitude of different, but similar, definitions for DT in the literature, reflecting adoption of DT in various research domains. A common definition of DT capturing most of the concepts used in various applications is ?a probabilistic simulation model for an as-built physical entity (sensor, device, system or process) that represents the properties (control and configuration capabilities), state (updates), conditions (interactions with the environment), and history of the entity in a way that mirrors its life and behavior?. A comprehensive list of definitions in different applications is given in [19]. In this paper, rather than the exact definition we elucidate the main characteristics and requirements of DTs. A DT is a unified high-fidelity simulation model that represents a physical entity in the past, present, and future. With respect to the past and the present, a DT in the virtual space mirrors the behavior of an entity in the physical space. Regarding the future, the DT predicts accurately the behavior of the entity which is sufficient for the control process. Further, the behavior of the entity in a simulated environment (which is not necessarily observed) can be inferred using the DT models for the purpose of policy exploration. Constructing a model with the above capabilities requires a bidi- rectional communication between the physical entity and the DT. The measurements are collected from the physical space, trans- ferred through the network, and consumed by DTs in real-time to update models, and potentially control policies.

","it necessitates methodological and theoretical solutions to address longstanding challenges. For instance, being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, DTs share commonalities in implementation and operational behavior. Due to this fact, DTs may act as a source of data breach, leading to the abuse case of DTs where attackers may launch covert attacks on the physical system by exploiting the valuable system knowledge available through DTs. For example, attackers may sabotage the system by manipulating DTs data such that the physical counterpart may not indicate data inconsistencies. Attacks instigated through DTs may have similar repercussions as that of directly attacking real field devices. DTs must exhibit sufficient fidelity to protect against failures of the real CPS. However, uncertain scenarios may occur due to the dynamism and complexity of underlying (sub) systems, for instance, machinery malfunctioning, hidden vulnerabilities, erroneous data, knowledge gaps, etc. This problem may raise the question: how accurately DTs are required to follow the states of their physical counterparts On the one hand, due to the black-box nature of AI models, the decisions made by the resulting systems suffer from a loss of transparency and comprehensibility, hence leading to a negative impact on the system?s trustworthiness. However, on the other hand, complete transparency into the inner working of AI models may expose them to adversarial attacks by allowing them to make inferences from live cyber data or executing model poisoning into the training workflows. Attackers may begin with AI reconnaissance (i.e., observe the model?s behavior and learn the decision logic or knowledge bases to morph the malicious payloads) and, without being detected, can feed their adversarial data to launch data exfiltration attacks."
Suhail2022ab,HIGH,"However, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envi? sions a blockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical Systems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework through a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through Integrity Checking Mechanisms (ICMs). Additionally, Safety and Security (S&S) rules evaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain, thereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by the underlying systems. Finally, we perform formal verification of the TTS-CPS. / In this work, we have targeted two critical challenges, i.e., (i) how to establish a situational-aware and secure CPS through DTs, and (ii) how to establish the trustworthy generation of specification-based DTs. To address these issues, we have proposed a TTS-CPS frame? work. We demonstrate the feasibility of the TTS-CPS framework for an assembly line in the automotive industry through a prototypical implementation supporting the simulated network topology, PLCs, HMIs, and physical devices. Moreover, we perform formal modelling and verification of the TTS-CPS.","Digital Twins (DTs) are considered one such solution. Being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, DTs share the ex? pected operational behaviour of the underlying systems (Suhail and Jurdak, 2021) and provide a sustainable strategy for analyzing, monitoring, and predicting the behaviour of a system (Corallo et al., 2017). To do so, DTs collect data from multiple sources, such as in? stalled sensors and actuators at the factory floor, historical produc? tion data derived from product lifecycle data, and domain knowledge. Following a closed feedback loop, DT inspects for data inconsistencies between the physical entity and virtual entity and feed back the simulation data to the physical entity to adopt better calibration and testing strategies (Suhail et al., 2021). To fully har? ness the features of DT, the data used by the DT needs to be trust? worthy and secure. For instance, reasoning about the current state of a data object entails a complete lineage of processes chain (Suhail et al., 2020). Additionally, the requirement of data trustworthiness becomes more critical as it may affect the next system generation where DT data can be used as historical data. Unreliable data used as historical data in guiding future system iterations can lead to sig? nificant deviations from the system?s desired behaviour. In this re? gard, leveraging blockchain technology allows industries to manage data on a distributed ledger while ensuring trusted DT data co? ordination (Suhail et al., 2019, Shen et al., 2021).","Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs.",Smart Manufacturing,"monitoring,simulating,predicting,optimizing ",N/A,"Robotic arm, convyeyor belt","velocity, object detection, current, pressure, temperature","DIGITAL_PHYSICAL, DIGITAL_EXPERT",digital twin,EtherNet/IP or Modbus/TCP,"For our use case scenario showcased in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, we use MiniCPS (Antonioli and Tippenhauer, 2015) which is built on Mininet (Lantz et al., 2020)- a prototyping environment for networks.

Furthermore, we plan to incorporate smart contracts to automate event-based processes such as triggering the appropriate defence mechanisms through S&S rules and modifying simulation setup parameters. Such automation ensures the benign behaviour of DTs, particularly during the replication mode due to cyclic updates","In general, several other technical challenges need to be ad? dressed, for instance, data trustworthiness, particularly in hier? archical DTs or a combination of DT instances that mimic the bigger picture of the CPS.

Xiao2022,LOW,"In this paper, we proposed CommandFence, a novel preven- tive framework to secure smart home systems from reaching risky states when app commands combined human activities and environmental variations are executed. CommandFence is based on digital-twin, a new concept that is fundamentally different than those employed by the existing well-received access control frameworks. It is composed of an Interposition Layer and an Emulation Layer to first interpose the app commands and then execute them in a virtual smart home en- vironment that can predict whether the operations of the com- mands combining with human activities and environmental variations may transition a normal smart home environment to a dangerous one, and if yes, the commands are dropped before they are sent to the real smart home system. / Our Contributions. The major contributions are listed as follows: ? We proposed CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based preventive framework to defend against the threats caused by malicious apps with evil intentions as well as benign ones with design flaws or logical errors that may harm a smart home environment when being executed and inter- acting with human activities and environmental changes. CommandFence is built on a fundamentally new idea, i.e., digital-twin, and is orthogonal to the well-received permission-based access control mechanisms, but it can capture the app commands that may lead the smart home environment to a risky state when being executed and drop them before any insecure situation can appear. ? We implemented our proposed CommandFence frame- work and trained the DQN with 232,315 pieces of sensing data collected from two real smart home environments. We tested our implementation on 553 official SmartApps 1 on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 erroneous ones, among which 31 were reported to be problematic the first time to our best knowledge, which may cause a risky situation due to care- less implementations 2 . We then tested our implementation against the 10 pure evil SmartApps created by [1], and CommandFence labeled 7 of them as risky, with the rest 3 being missed because they are not harmful to the smart home system but only cause smartphone information leaks. We also tested our implementation against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors [2] and achieved 100% success rates of flagging them as risky.

Third, YAHFA is attached to the VirtualApp process, and checks if the function is a target function to be hooked (called originMethod in YAHFA) based on the hook plugin. Then it copies the target function codes for execution. Fourth, if YAHFA finds that an originMethod should be hooked, it makes a backup for this function (called backupMethod in YAHFA), then changes the entry point entry_point_from_jni_ of originMethod to the one of the hook function, i.e., the injected function (called hookMethod in YAHFA).

Then whenever a PLC emits a voltage signal, the interceptor can intercept the signal and direct it to the Emulation Layer for further analysis. To implement the Emulation Layer, we need to first develop a program reversing the voltage back to some human-readable languages such as ladder diagram, instruction language, function block diagram, or sequential function chart, which would be interpreted as commands. We then need to implement a digital-twin version of the IIoT system which should include as many digital actuators as possible, e.g., sensors, relays, motors, servos, CNC machines. Lastly, we can execute the commands in the digital-twin environment and employ learning algorithms to complete different tasks such as active defense, fault diagnosis [64], vulnerability identification and accident avoidance. One can see that the overall migration process to IIoT requires tremendous efforts to accomplish. Nevertheless, the potential of exploiting digital twin to develop defense mechanisms for more complicated systems such as IIoT is definitely worthy of exploration.","its current design can only deal with threats from the smart home apps installed in a user?s smartphone, while in practice threats may come from other sources including remote attackers from the external environments. Therefore, we will consider the design of defensive mechanisms embedded into smart devices, endowing them with the capabilities to hinder attacks from all sources.

Zhou2022abcde,MEDIUM,"in this paper, we propose a framework for a digital twin based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.","Digital Twin was first mentioned as a concept in a product life management class in 2002[6]. The detail of the digital twin is not the same when applied to dif- ferent domains. In general, digital twins can be referred to as a presentation of the physical space?s real-world assets in virtual space. Conceptually, in their whole life cycle, the virtual twin changes dynamically along with the physical twin. They communicate in dual direc- tions, unlike similar concepts such as the static digital models and digital shadows, which communicate in a single direction. There is a conclusion[7] that the digital twin, in the narrow sense, solves the problem of how to simulate the physical products realistically, in a broad sense, the digital twin is an integrated system that can simulate, monitor, calculate, regulate, and control the system status and processes. / However, some researchers[9] hold an opinion that the visual part of the virtual twin is not necessary as long as the system is capable of dealing with the data from the real world and interacts with the physical twin, considering a broad concept of a digital twin","There is a conclusion[7] that the digital twin, in the narrow sense, solves the problem of how to simulate the physical products realistically, in a broad sense, the digital twin is an integrated system that can simulate, monitor, calculate, regulate, and control the system status and processes.",Smart Manufacturing,training,Edge,"CPS, PLCs","The data model is mainly built logically. The data that are reachable from the sensors and available for PLC to transmit on IIoT communica- tion protocols need to be figured out. Nevertheless, in general, all data are not valuable for a specific service. Therefore, the data screening methods could be used in this stage. After the collection, the data from the field devices are stored in a SQL SERVER database. The data are critical because they are needed to train the digital model in the service part to predicate the temperature value in our metering station if the heat control parameter is changed. The data are read on Modbus/TCP from PLC to virtual space. While all the data available from PLC are collected, as the pilot scenario is relatively simpler than the reality, only the features related to the temper are used by judgment in our data model, including the control parameter of heating power, the on and off of the cooling devices and so on.","DIGITAL_PHYSICAL, DIGITAL_EXPERT",digital twin,"Modbus/TCP, OPC, OPC UA, MQTT, S7comm, S7comm-plus","MATLAB/SIMULINK, Tecnomatrix Plant Simulation, unity3D,",Simulation,"Up to now, in our physical space, a petrochemical metering station, which is used to measure the flow rate of oil at various locations in real industries to monitor the performance of pipelines, has been established in our lab, as Figure 4 shows and there is an emulated scenario where there are some heaters simulated for controlling the temperature of the produced oil, a fan used to cool down the oil when it is too hot, a tempera- ture sensor used to send the measured value to the PLC in the real environment, and some other devices. The process is implemented in our Unity3D scene, where the assets work like the real ones. Figure 5 shows the real devices in the oil temperature control scenario, and their virtual geometry and behavior models are shown in Figure 6.",YES,"The corresponding fitting error is shown in Figure 7. Although some individual fitting errors are relatively significant, the fitting errors ranging from -0.1 to 0.06 are really small, generally speaking. The fluctuation might be related to improper operations during data generation and collection and needs to be handled dur-ing training. Therefore, some optimization is needed and necessary in future work. For another, it is to learn the trend of how tem- perature changes under the control of specific heating power control parameters through training with his- torical data. At first, the parameter is set to a fixed value, which can be a common value in the actual factory, and it is assumed that the entire control logic is to control the temperature within a specific range. When the temperature is too low, heat up, and if the temperature is too high, cool off.","However, concerning the widely accepted concep- tion of a digital twin, the limitations of our system are obvious. For one thing, our digital twin relies com- pletely on the machine learning model, which means that in some cases, such as device breaking down, which is uncommon in real work, and other extreme scenarios avoided from happening, the historical data hardly satisfy the need for machine learning. Thus, the effort of simulating the system on the physical layer, such as a heat convey formulation and analysis is required, which will be studied in the future. Moreover, the evolvement of the prediction model has not been implemented even though the changes in real devices are tiny, and this will be our future work as well."
