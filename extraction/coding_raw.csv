Calo2018,LOW,In this paper we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed.,N/A,The devices can use such a model to determine whether or not they should allow access to any resource or service that is being requested of them.,Organization,device model control,embedded,IoT Device,States depending on sensor data (unsafe/safe),DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,digital twin,N/A,N/A,Simulation,device state model,NO,N/A,Defining the right ‚Äúhigh-level guidance‚Äù:Access control policies were introduced as the general approach for simplifying the application of access control mechanisms to a divergent Blue Sky Session: Next Generation Security Services for Emerging Networks SACMAT‚Äô18 June 13-15 2018 Indianapolis IN USA4 set of use-cases. We need to define a similar concept for ‚Äúhigh level guidance‚Äù which will be applicable to various scenarios and contexts in a general way. The semantics to be used for high-level guidance needs to be defined. While that semantics can be defined for each of the different generation approaches discussed in Section 3 an open challenge remains that of identifying the abstraction that will create the concept of the ‚Äúhigh level guidance‚Äù that will be applicable to a broad set of use-case scenarios regardless of the approach used to generate policies. (2) Defining the right discovery process: Generating the right access control policy requires each of the resources in the environment to be aware of the other devices in the environment. Given the lack of widely adopted standards for discovery of resources and the many security exposures that may result from a flawed discovery process new discovery techniques that can provide sufficient security in many dynamic contexts are needed. (3) Determining the situational context: The definition of the situational context as well as its determination remains a hard and open research challenge. Access control needs to account for not only the other resources that any given resource interacts with but also for the resources that may indirectly use the information provided by that resource. Understanding the situation on the ground in sufficient detail to provide workable security is a challenge that can be solved on a case-by-case basis but a general formulation remains an open challenge. (4) Policy deconfliction without human guidance: When access control policies are generated by the resources they may conflict among themselves or with other policies that are imposed on the system to meet other requirements such as performance reliability or availability requirements. In the presence of a human such conflicts can be resolved and deconflicted using the human provided input. Similar algorithms which can operate without a human in the loop need to be developed. (5) Controlling emergent behavior: When resources create their own policies there is a danger of uncontrolled emergent behavior [15]. Emergent behavior is behavior shown by a collection of systems which was not originally designed but happens due to the dynamic interactions among different intelligent systems. Such emergent behavior can be controlled but the design needs to account for that. The control of emergent behavior in complete generality remains an open challenge but there may be solutions that can be developed for specific domain of access control. (6) Learning-related challenges: The approach used by resources to learn their access control policy has to use some type of learning approach which creates a generalization based on its past experiences but such learning mechanism has its challenges. The set of experiences for access control in each use-case has only a few small data points to draw from which means that either existing learning techniques that use only a few data points need to be used or new learning techniques requiring small data for training needs to be actor may manipulate the data so as to force the device to learn an invalid model which could lead to generation of insecure access control policies. Solutions to such adversarial learning in uncontrolled environments need to be developed. (7) Increase in attack surface. The increase in complexity due to autonomous generation of policies by devices can lead to new types of security vulnerabilities and threats e.g. the adversarial learning example given above. This could lead to challenges with established assurance processes in enterprise and government networks and the right way to provide assurance for systems using dynamically generated access control policies need to be developed. (8) Power computation and communication efficiency. While in the past several years there have been tremendous advantages in the computational capacity of small devices devices that need to learn and manage their own policies may find themselves unable to use approaches that require specialized hardware or significant computational power e.g. learning mechanisms based on deep neural networks. For any solution developed with dynamic access control policies system design should incorporate mechanisms that take into account the limitations on a resource which usually manifests itself as limited amount of battery power computational capacity or the ability to communicate at high bandwidth rates.

Moreover someDTs even provide a direct interaction with the asset.,Smart Manufacturing,security testing,cloud embedded,Every Asset,N/A,DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,digital twin,N/A,N/A,Analysis intelligence simulation and other services,N/A,N/A,DTs  require  substantial technical efforts from  firms. Especially the incorporation of heterogeneous data requires further  progress.  For  instance  the  standardization  in  data acquisition needs to be accelerated. Also issues with real-time data have to be focused on. For instance the manual acquisition of real-time data has to be automated  to  enable  the  collection  of  full  historical  data instead of snapshots. Another great technical burden is the current decentralization. Interfaces connections and the like need to be developed to enable a more holistic approach. Moreover security concerns have to  be  addressed.  This  includes  version  management  and compatibility  checks  of  the  DT  versions  to  ensure  data integrity  as  well  as  access  management  to  allow  third parties to access (parts of) the virtual twin. At different levels corporate challenges remain. While operational  challenges  mostly  overlap  with  the  technical challenges the DT potentially implies major economic and organizational  transformations  at  a  strategic  level.  The strategic decision of DT implementation focuses on but is not  limited  to  the  degree  of  asset-centralization  of  an organization. The degree of reflecting the real-world  asset  varies  depending  on  the  use  case.  Consequently this poses yet another corporate challenge in terms of  depth  of  detail  and  granularity.  Moreover  the  study indicates  that  at  present  the  term  ‚Äò‚ÄòDigital  Twin‚Äô‚Äô  can  be misleading as it is applied for slightly different phenomena in  different  areas. Entangled with  the  complexity  of  DTs  a  further  strategic  decision bases on the tradeoff between the cost of an asset versus the cost  of  the  DT  and  its  data  granularity  (e.g.  by  including sensors). However with the general decrease in storage and sensor  cost  the implementation  of  DTs  tends  to  become more  attractive.  Moreover  the  emergence  of  novel business  models including such where the organization does not possess  the asset but provides the service of establishing a DT will  entail major privacy issues ‚Äì including the question of ownership of the virtual counterpart,Although  first  assumptions  about  the  effects  of  DTs exist future research should analyze the concrete technical and  corporate  implications.  One  impact  of  DTs  concerns the  improvement  in  interconnectivity  especially  within supply  chains  where  research  should  not  be limited  to  a single  firm‚Äôs  perspective  but  rather  take  a  system-of-systems  approach.  Another  potential  for  enterprises  is  the closure  of  feedback  loops  along  and  the  coherent  linkage between the lifecycle phases of the asset. Here the gain of new  insights  can  lead  to  a  win-win  situation  among  the involved  parties.  Currently  very  little  is  known  about potential data-driven business models their power of digital  disruptiveness  and  pricing  strategies  for  DT  services. Research can contribute by identifying the strategic role of DTs for firms and its position in digital transformation not only from the perspectives of companies owning the DTsbut  also  from  third  parties  contributing  to  the  resources.
Eckhart2018,HIGH,In this work we present a framework that allows usersto create and execute digital twins closely matching their physicalcounterparts.We focus on a novel approach to automatically generatethe virtual environment from specification taking advantage ofengineering data exchange formats,The term Digital Twin was coined by Shafto et al [29] and describesthe use of holistic simulations to virtually mirror a physicalsystem [26],On top of this virtual representation multiple securityfeatures can be established. For example security and safety rulesstated as part of the specification can be automatically monitoredon the basis of digital twins,Smart Manufacturing,intrusion detection system testing system simulation detecting misconfigurations penetration testing,N/A,CPS,HMIW PLCs Motor etc. ,DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,digital twin,N/A,CPS Twinning Mininet MatIEC,Simulation Analss,AML files (domain knowledge + engineer knowledge) manually,YES,As future work we want to focus on the replication mode of the framework i.e. mirroring the state of physical systems to their corresponding digital twins. To validate our approach we plan to launch a MITM attack in the real environment for the purpose of detecting deviations in the behavior of digital twins to spot attacks as early as possible,Current limitations of the prototype include a limited support of data types in PLC code (data types other than Boolean and integer are not available) and Modbus function codes. There are also some steps which have been triggered manually but could be integrated in a complete automation pipeline. For example the translation of vendor-specific function blocks
Eckhart2018a,HIGH,In this paper we propose anovel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli basedon the systems specification and then replicates them in a virtualenvironment.,of digital twins1 ie virtual replicas of the network and the logiclayer of physical devices closely matching the physical devicesbehavior on these layers,digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS allowing toperform a security and safety analysis during operation withoutthe risk of disrupting live systems.,Smart Manufacturing,security analysis intrusion detection,N/A,ICS,states of machines network traffic system logs sensor measurements,DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,digital twin,N/A,CPS Twinning CPS State Replication Mininet,Replicationm FSM and behavioural models ,AML files (domain knowledge + engineer knowledge) manually,YES,Furthermore as our approach focuses only on states of software programs support for replicating stimuli that manifest themselves in the form of analog signals is lacking. Thus analog values that constitute stimuli must be converted to a binary representation before they can be replicated in the virtual environment. However considering that CPSs typically consist of analog-intensive components further research in this area is worth pursuing.,While the results of this work are promising there are still some challenges to be addressed to improve the state replication approach. For example depending on the nature of the device or caused by inaccuracies of the specification inferring the device‚Äôs characteristics based on the role definition may be infeasible. In this case users are required to either add details about stimuli or explicitly label inputs as stimuli. Another possible option yet more complex to implement may be to develop a code analyzer that automatically inspects all programs which are referenced in a CPS‚Äôs specification for the purpose of stimuli identification. Furthermore as our approach focuses only on states of software programs support for replicating stimuli that manifest themselves in the form of analog signals is lacking. Thus analog values that constitute stimuli must be converted to a binary representation before they can be replicated in the virtual environment

Eckhart2019,HIGH,In this chapter we will discuss how digitaltwins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle andthereby strengthen the security of CPSs.,virtual replica of a system that accompanies its physical counterpartduring phases of its lifecycle consumes real time and historical data if required andhas sufficient fidelity to allow the implementation of the desired security measure,Digital twins refer to virtual replicas of physical objects that inter aliaenable to monitor visualize and predict states of cyber-physical systems (CPSs).,Smart Manufacturing,security by design intrusion detection secure commissioning detecting hardware misconfigurations detecting software misconfigurations security testing privacy system testing system training security compliance legal compliance,cloud,CPS environment collobritations functions modules objectives tasks,data availabe (everythng),DIGITAL_PHYSICAL DIGITAL_EXPERT,digital twin,OPC UA  AML,CPS Twinning Mininet,Repolication Simulation Analysis,AML files (domain knowledge + engineer knowledge) manually,NO,In the futuremore research is definitely required to investigate the practicality of the concept for security-enhancing use cases.,However as for example indicated developing IPSs for CPSs represents a challenging task due to the fact that false alarms (e.g. dropped packets of benign control commands) may raise safety concerns. Overcoming this challenge seems to be also relevant for digital-twin research in general since data flows from a digital twin (back) to its physical counterpart can serve as a response mechanism.

Empl2021,LOW,this paper conceptualizesa security analytics service used as a security add-onto these reference architectures. Thus this paper conceptualizes aflexible security analytics service that implements security capabilitieswith flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs needs.,Concerning the security analytics servicessecurity modules a digital twin represents the link from real timedata to feasible simulation or forecast scenarios In this context thedigital twin is therefore regarded as a foresight security module,The sensor cloud collects and aggregates this data to determine the potential security state with security analytics (e.g. via a digital twin).,Smart Manufacturing,security analytics,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,simulations replications and analytics,N/A,NO,In the future we will work on implementing a prototype of this security analytics service. The design of a specific implementation can be structured in several ways.We recommend a design based on virtual machines dockerized applications and specific connectors for a straightforward adoption and application of the capability modules. As we admit in the introduction data is vital to generate wisdom. By bundling the data sources and types of data (stream vs batch) required to fulfil a particular capability module (e.g. the descriptive module takes batch data) analytical techniques can be instantiated. Thus each capability module should be represented by one virtual machine. The virtual machines can be interconnected with dedicated bridges to accomplish the dependencies between the capability modules. Each of the virtual machines is running on Docker to establish containerized and modular applications. There are many open-source software and tools for security analytics applications that need to be categorized depending on their functionality e.g. Suricata is an intrusion detection tool and is therefore available in the detective module. In this context the security analytics repository is considered a collection of dockerized applications. Besides provisioning dockerized applications the security analytics repositories need to yield connectors for each application to bind multiple applications‚Äô sinks and sources. Additionally machine learning models can be shared across the security analytics repository and integrated into the desired capability module. Those machine learning models might be integrated into the predictive module (stream data) and the descriptive module (batch data). The different analytical techniques can be tagged inside the security analytics repository (e.g. for detective module) and ranked by other users. These mechanisms are resulting in transparency as to which methods are successfully contributing to the cybersecurity,(Besides the contribution this paper exhibits two limitations. First we do not specify any access control roles to our security analytics service as we have only covered a single entity (security expert). Second we excluded parts of the incident response. As the response opportunities to a detected or predicted threat increase with the complexity of IIoT systems e.g. with software-defined networks for the ICS a holistic sketch of interconnections within the archi- tectural module is almost impossible.)

It remains as part of future work for the evaluation of the applicability of modeling approach on other CPSs (i.e. Electric Power Grid Systems where generators switches/breakers and batteries are analogous to pumps valves and tanks).

However CPS underpinned by AI are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations under which wrongdoers try to morph its adversarial input data to augment the misclassification rate in the ML model. Attackers may begin with AI reconnaissance (i.e. observe the model‚Äôs behavior and learn the decision logic or knowledge bases to morph the malicious payloads) and without being detected can feed their adversarial data to launch data exfiltration attacks.

Holmes2021,HIGH,In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence. ,Broadly stated a DT is a digitally determined model that unique depicts a physical instance process service system biologic or like abstraction. Gartner takes a broader view and defines a DT as a ‚Äôdigital representation of a real- world entity or system‚Äô. Grieves is credited for coining the term to describe a digital informational construct based upon a physical system but created as an separate entity where the digital construct should ideally be endowed with all informational assets as those found on the physical entity. Kitzinger et al. describe a DT as a concept that is capable of being further sub-divided into variants based upon their integration status the particular area of focus and the technology employed.,The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis design optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems.,Industry 4.0,solution for a trusted internet of things,N/A,IoT Devices CPS,N/A,DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,DIGITAL_TWIN,N/A,N/A,Prediction Analysis Emulation Monitoring,N/A,NO,To achieve the full benefits of DTs further research is needed to make the implementation of complex systems through a DT approach feasible and economical. ,We consider the main challenge to be the creation of DTs without increasing the cybersecurity risks for the real system. The answer lies in the technologies that help to create the realism of the physical systems without revealing the security-sensitive components data and interactions. Existing technologies in the areas of deception and privacy-enhancing techniques may provide a good starting point but may not be sufficient to provide a solution to the issue.

Each newly introduced dynamic range has multiple associated attributes including the time the place and the range of influence. Different dimensions supply the IDT with different control mechanisms and AI logic which cannot be fully approximated in due time. Edge computing solutions must adapt to work in a real-time environment decreasing the accuracy of the estimation transformed it into a wide and unpredicted range of impacts on the containers handling procedures.

Maher2018,LOW,We discuss a high-level model for software applications and services that can support a minimal set of human-centric trust management capabilities. We outline the unique set of challenges we must address if we are to attain a level of trust that will be required for a robust deployment of an IoT. We discuss the role of standards and how we can maximize the effectiveness of standards and device and service certification. We suggest a set of solutions for trust management that can support the unique security safety and privacy requirements of a robust IoT ,a virtual digital copy stored in the cloud or at a service point,and we can make the direct to device interaction model even simpler by using the ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù concept whereby many interactions with the IoT device can be performed via an interaction with a virtual digital copy stored in the cloud or at a service point accessible to both the cloud and the device (gateway).

E.g. it can be investigated how attacks on the plant can be distinguished from pure malfunctions which have a different dynamic signature. A further example is the assessment of the most appropriate counter measures to preserve safe plant operation or at least securely shut down the parts of the plants under attack. ,The current method fails to manage some practical issues which must be looked at more closely in future development. Firstly there is no cyclic state update from the real process as this communication channel would have to be secured against any manipulation to not compromise the digital twin itself. This is fine if only batch processes like in the example plant are considered where initial conditions can be reset for each batch. Secondly the scalability of the root cause analysis is currently only guaranteed for the signal dependencies in the field and process level as the simulation model is based on a type- instance concept. The analysis of the PLC code is currently not systematized. Thirdly it must be evaluated how the whole approach can still work under a manipulation of the digital twin itself or how the twin can be secured against attacks.

Suhail2021b,MEDIUM,We discuss the applicability of the proposed framework for the automotive industry as a CPS use case. Finally we identify the open challenges that impede the implementation of intelligence-driven architectures in CPSs. ,DTs are virtual replicas of physical systems that mirror every facet of a product or process and can provide actionable insights through monitoring optimization and prediction ,In this regard Digital Twins (DTs) are revolutionizing the CPSs. DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle while assuming that the DT data is trusted providing agility to predict and respond to real-time changes. Predictive maintenance situational awareness system resilience record and replay enabler automated security,Industry,Intrusion Detection Threat Intelligence,N/A,ICS CPS,real-time sensor data,DIGITAL_PHYSICAL,DIGITAL_TWIN,N/A,N/A,Replication Analysis Simulation,The DTs are build by acquiring process knowledge from the specifications of CPS and TI. ,YES,Some of the pointers for this future research direction include gamification strategies that not only serves for training and testing pur- poses but can also evaluate the security of DTs and eventually physical asset. ,it necessitates methodological and theoretical solutions to address longstanding challenges. For instance being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts DTs share commonalities in implementation and operational behavior. Due to this fact DTs may act as a source of data breach leading to the abuse case of DTs where attackers may launch covert attacks on the physical system by exploiting the valuable system knowledge available through DTs. For example attackers may sabotage the system by manipulating DTs data such that the physical counterpart may not indicate data inconsistencies. Attacks instigated through DTs may have similar repercussions as that of directly attacking real field devices. DTs must exhibit sufficient fidelity to protect against failures of the real CPS. However uncertain scenarios may occur due to the dynamism and complexity of underlying (sub) systems for instance machinery malfunctioning hidden vulnerabilities erroneous data knowledge gaps etc. This problem may raise the question: how accurately DTs are required to follow the states of their physical counterparts On the one hand due to the black-box nature of AI models the decisions made by the resulting systems suffer from a loss of transparency and comprehensibility hence leading to a negative impact on the system‚Äôs trustworthiness. However on the other hand complete transparency into the inner working of AI models may expose them to adversarial attacks by allowing them to make inferences from live cyber data or executing model poisoning into the training workflows. Attackers may begin with AI reconnaissance (i.e. observe the model‚Äôs behavior and learn the decision logic or knowledge bases to morph the malicious payloads) and without being detected can feed their adversarial data to launch data exfiltration attacks.
