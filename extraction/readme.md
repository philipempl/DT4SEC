# Extraction Schema

## General

- **G_Relevance**: assess the overall relevance. HIGH=the paper is only about DTs for Security, MEDIUM=the Paper describes the DT4Sec in a few paragraphs and LOW=the paper shortly desribes DT4sec
- **G_Contribution**: extract the main contribution of the paper (e.g., abstract)

## RQ1: Digital Twin Paradigm

- **RQ1_Definition**: Extract Definitions of the Digital Twin

## RQ2: Digital Twin Application

-  **RQ2_Benefit**: Extract the reason why the autors use the Digital Twin.
- **RQ2_Application_Domain**: Extract in which Industry the Digital Twin is used.
- **RQ2_Application_Scenario**: Extract the concret cybersecurity scenario of the Digital Twin.

## RQ3: Digital Twin Implementation
