## Search

You can find all the iterative and systematic search details in the following directory: .We searched a total of ten databases (dblp, arxiv, AISeL, WoS, IEEE Xplore, ACM, IEEE CS, Wiley, Springer Link, ScienceDirect) were searched and performed subsequent backward and forward searches. 

## Screening

Based on obtained results, we screened the literature. You find the details  in the file: . We conducted the first screen based on the title. The second screen involves the availability of the full text applying different exclusion criteria: quality, availability, digital twins applied for non-security use cases, the digital twin is lacking, digital twin application in a scenario other than IoT or CPS, security enhancement for the digital twin, or a complete book instead of single chapters.
