Digital measurements will ensure the following: eliminating manual error or inconsistency, increasing productivity, minimizing waste, and enabling greater factory automation. Several measurands can be recorded with a data acquisition system including distance and displacement, temperature, voltage, current strain, and pressure. Measurement and quantification are the basic concepts of metrology. This considers explicit and internationally accepted definitions, principles and standards. Similar to the principle of digital twin manufacturing, digital twin metrology inspection is the combination of a software model of the product as 3D CAD with semantic tolerances.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Aquaponics, one of the vertical farming methods, is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains’ knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to represent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology provides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system’s knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision-making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Recently, Industry 4.0 facilitates implementing several modular smart factories particularly the Cyber-Physical System. Due to enhanced growth in the Cyber-Physical System, privacy and security issues turned out to be the most significant factor all over the world. This paper demonstrates a complete co-design approach meant for integrating the cyberspace and physical space of a cyber-physical system. Various strategies and models regarding cyber and physical space are established in CPS. Apart from numerous co-design strategies, there are several parameters yet to be resolved and established. It becomes complicated and tricky to examine and explore the extremely best value since these parameters make up a very huge space. Therefore, a metaheuristic algorithm such as improved Fuzzy Harmonic Search Algorithm is proposed to optimize the control parameters so as to obtain a feasible solution. Also, this approach minimizes the cost function using Maximum Allowable Delay Bound (MADB) when subjected to several constraints such as the Sampling period, Horizon length, Routing graph, and scheduling table. Moreover the comparative analyses of various approaches such as Fuzzy Harmony Search (FHS) algorithm, Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm as well as Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy GA) are evaluated to examine the performances of the proposed approach. A testbed is organized for evaluation and exploration in a manufacturing atmosphere. The result reveals that this proposed approach provides enhanced control performance and communication reliability even under very harsh environmental habitat.},

Data has become more ubiquitous with the increase in the development of mobile and wireless networking technologies. Also, due to high expectations for productivity improvement, efficiency, and enabling innovative service through collaborative means, IoT is attracting much attention. CPS is the integration of computational objects in fitting together with the corporal biosphere and its procedures. CPSs are complicated manufacturing systems with the goal to combine and harmonize mechanism biosphere and industrial capability to the cyber computational space. Nevertheless, having thorough interconnectivity and a computational platform is essential for a practicable application of CPSs and smart factories. Smart manufacturing, also known as Industry 4.0 or Industry Internet of Things (IIoT), is increasingly becoming the common goal of various industrial and national strategies. For a better implementation of smart manufacturing, smart interconnection is one of the most significant issues. Current technologies, however, are not yet completely equipped for smart interconnection while working with heterogeneous hardware, fast setup, and delivery, as well as online service generation. In this chapter, the effects of IoT technology and CPS in the advancement and awareness of real-life smart manufacturing is addressed. An integrated IoT and CPS framework is recommended as a specification for researchers and industries toward the full realization of the potentials of IoT with CPS in the development of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing technologies.},

  abstract       = {Digital technologies are a key element in the logistics sector development. The so-called digital revolution that began in the 1980s, on the basis of the increasingly widespread use of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics in production processes, is changing the face of world logistics, a change often referred to as Logistics 4.0. Building on the impact of digitalisation on other sectors, port cities are also expected to see the emergence of new business models in the coming years, made possible by the advancement of digital technologies. Some researchers and practitioners even foresee the development of a global cargo handling system similar to the Internet, called Physical Internet (PI), in which goods would be moved seamlessly on an intermodal network at very low costs thanks to state-of-the-art data management technologies. The development of a PI-based logistics model requires new methods of monitoring and managing data, on the physical characteristics of the goods, as well as on the financial flows and traceability of the products; and ports are likely to play a critical role in favouring the uptake of such data collections and use. One of the most promising enablers to this vision is blockchain, a technology that would make it possible to document an increasingly large number of characteristics of a product or a commodity. The shipping sector cannot be caught unprepared, and adequate support is also needed inside ports. This chapter reviews the current technology and digitalisation trends in ports, advancing hypotheses on how they are likely to change port-city cargo—but also people—mobility and influence port logistics.},

  title = {Artificial Intelligence and COVID-19: A Systematic umbrella review and roads ahead},
  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.},

  abstract       = {Industry Revolution 4.0 generate significant issues to still a large group of enterprises and often even barriers to the processes of their further growth or improving market competitiveness. Unfortunately, awareness among the businesses regarding their specificity, prevalence and real consequences is limited. This is why identification of major problems of effective shaping of enterprises’ competitiveness in the Industry 4.0 era is the research problem. Consequently, the main goal of the paper is to identify and map the key barriers and potential sources of failure in processes of building competitive advantage of enterprises operating in the age of Industry 4.0, the so-called Black Points and creation of a specific Road Map which is a path/algorithm of actions illustrating how organisations can better prepare themselves to overcome these key barriers. The research was based on a review of the literature on strategic management, competitiveness of businesses, theory on competitive advantage or describing requirements that organisations face in the age of IR 4.0. The collected data was compared with the empirical results of research by global management consultancies who assessed the problems and degree of implementation of IR 4.0 solutions and preparation of enterprises from various countries to the requirements of IR 4.0.},

To prevent from COVID-19 and reduce its impact in sustainable smart cities, the global research communities are working relentlessly by harnessing the emerging technologies to develop the safest diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment procedures, and Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the pioneers among them. IoT can perform a pivotal role to diminish its immense contagious rate by suitable utilization in emerging healthcare IoT applications in sustainable smart cities. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to outline a survey of the emerging healthcare IoT applications practiced in the perspective of COVID-19 pandemic in terms of network architecture security, trustworthiness, authentication, and data preservation followed by identifying existing challenges to set the future research directions. The salient contributions of this work deal with the accomplishment of a detailed and comprehensive literature review of COVID-19 starting from 2019 through 2021 in the context of emerging healthcare IoT technology. In addition, we extend the correlated contributions of this work by highlighting the weak aspects of the existing emerging healthcare IoT applications, security of different network layers and secure communication environment followed by some associated requirements to address these challenges. Moreover, we also identify future research directions in sustainable smart cities for emerging healthcare IoT utilization in the context of COVID-19 with the most productive results and least network implementation costs.},

Authors identified no studies focussing on presenting a PdM value analysis or cost model specifically for small-medium enterprises (SMEs) operating computer numerically controlled (CNC) MTs. This paper’s novelty is addressing SMEs’ minimal representation in literature by explanatorily collecting data from SMEs within the focal area via surveys, modelling and analysing datasets, then proposes a cost-effective PdM system architecture for SME CNC machine shops that predicts cost savings ranging from £22,804 to £48,585 over a range of 1–50 CNC MTs maintained on a distributed numerically controlled (DNC) network. It affirms PdM’s tangible value creation for SME CNC machine shops with predicted positive impacts on their MT cost and performance drivers. These exploratory research findings corroborate SMEs pooling together to optimise their CNC MT maintenance cost through the recommended system architecture. Finally, it introduces opportunities for further PdM research taking into account SMEs’ perspective. The paper’s industrial application is confirmed from the surveyed SMEs that demonstrated their current utility of PdM; then anonymous positive feedback on the online dashboard, shared with participant companies, confirmed the research results supported SMEs in considering exploring the path to adapting PdM. It is anticipated that beneficiaries of this research will be maintenance managers, business executives and researchers who seek to understand the expected financial and performance impact of adopting PdM for a MT’s overall life cycle costs.},

A Discrete Event Simulation software is assuming the role of the cyber twin, executing simulation software queries on real time data produced by IoT devices embedded on the physical twin, i.e. the automation, which are then processed, updating the simulation to the next system state. In that way, DTs facilitate the convergence of the physical and virtual warehouse, thus supporting efficient and responsive warehouse planning, management and decision making. This paper explores the current literature on the integration of DES and DTs and identifies trends and challenges for contemporary Logistics.},

  abstract       = {Manufacturers of automated systems and their components have been allocating an enormous amount of time and effort in R&D activities, which led to the availability of prototypes demonstrating new capabilities as well as the introduction of such systems to the market within different domains. Manufacturers need to make sure that the systems function in the intended way and according to specifications. This is not a trivial task as system complexity rises dramatically the more integrated and interconnected these systems become with the addition of automated functionality and features to them. This effort translates into an overhead on the V&V (verification and validation) process making it time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present VALU3S, an ECSEL JU (joint undertaking) project that aims to evaluate the state-of-the-art V&V methods and tools, and design a multi-domain framework to create a clear structure around the components and elements needed to conduct the V&V process. The main expected benefit of the framework is to reduce time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems with respect to safety, cyber-security, and privacy requirements. This is done through identification and classification of evaluation methods, tools, environments and concepts for V&V of automated systems with respect to the mentioned requirements. VALU3S will provide guidelines to the V&V community including engineers and researchers on how the V&V of automated systems could be improved considering the cost, time and effort of conducting V&V processes. To this end, VALU3S brings together a consortium with partners from 10 different countries, amounting to a mix of 25 industrial partners, 6 leading research institutes, and 10 universities to reach the project goal.},

Digital Twin (DT) technology is based on the integration of different traditional tools, such as simulation modeling and sensors, and is aimed at increasing process performance. In DTs, simulation modeling allows for the building of a digital copy of real processes, which is dynamically updated through data derived from smart objects based on sensor technologies. The use of DT within manufacturing activities is constantly increasing, as DTs are being applied in different areas, from the design phase to the operational ones. This study aims to analyze existing fields of applications of DTs for supporting safety management processes in order to evaluate the current state of the art. A bibliometric review was carried out through VOSviewer to evaluate studies and applications of DTs in the engineering and computer science areas and to identify research clusters and future trends. Next, a bibliometric and systematic review was carried out to deepen the relation between the DT approach and safety issues. The findings highlight that in recent years, DT applications have been tested and developed to support operators during normal and emergency conditions and to enhance their abilities to control safety levels.},

Although cyber–physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber–cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber–cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber–cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber–cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber–cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical ramifications for the design, implementation and deployment of digital twins at Facebook.},

  abstract       = {The energy industry is at a crossroads. Digital technological developments have the potential to change our energy supply, trade, and consumption dramatically. The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study’s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security. Given the pace of development in information technology, AI and data analysis, regulatory approvals for new services and products in the new Era of digital energy markets can be enforced as quickly and efficiently as possible.},

Governments and companies invest billions of dollars in technologies to convert, harvest, rising demand, changing demand and supply patterns, efficiency, lack of analytics required for optimal energy planning, and store energy. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently. Moreover, policy recommendations, research opportunities, and how industry 4.0 will improve sustainability have been briefly described.},

It enables customised patient outcomes via the development of novel, targeted medical approaches with a focus on intelligent, data-centric smart healthcare models. Currently, precision healthcare is seen as a challenging model to apply due to the complexity of the healthcare ecosystem, which is a multi-level and multifaceted environment with high real-time interactions among disciplines, practitioners, patients and discrete computer systems. Digital Twins (DT) pairs individual physical artefacts with digital models reflecting their status in real-time. Creating a live-model for healthcare services introduces new opportunities for patient care including better risk assessment and evaluation without disturbing daily activities. In this article, to address design and management in this complexity, we examine recent work in Digital Twins (DT) to investigate the goals of precision healthcare at a patient and healthcare system levels. We further discuss the role of DT to achieve precision healthcare, proposed frameworks, the value of active participation and continuous monitoring, and the cyber-security challenges and ethical implications for this emerging paradigm.},

  title = {A Digital Twin City Model for Age-Friendly Communities: Capturing Environmental Distress from Multimodal Sensory Data},
  year  = {2020},
  abstract       = {As the worldwide population is aging, the demands of aging-in-place are also increasing and require smarter and more connected cities to keep mobility independence of older adults. However, today’s aging built environment often poses great environmental demands to older adults’ mobility and causes their distresses. To better understand and help mitigating older adults’ distress in their daily trips, this paper proposes constructing the digital twin city (DTC) model that integrates multimodal data (i.e., physiological sensing, visual sensing) on environmental demands in urban communities, so that such environmental demands can be considered in mobility planning of older adults. Specifically, this paper examines how data acquired from various modalities (i.e., electrodermal activity, gait patterns, visual sensing) can portray environmental demands associated with older adults’ mobility. In addition, it discusses the challenges and opportunities of multimodal data fusion in capturing environmental distresses in urban communities.},

The industrial development based on advanced technologies such as rapid prototyping based on 3D printing (automotive, avionics, and electronics) or robotics acts as a critical enabler for rapid production with zero waste and generates new opportunities to use advanced manufacturing devices-based sensors and actuators in order to control all processes and to replace hard human work by machines. Starting from layered modular architecture of the IIoTS composed by user interface layer, software level, communication protocols, and hardware layer (cyber-physical systems, machines, sensors), we will analyze in this book chapter several aspects concerning data fusion and the possibility to use supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms in order to enable fast data analysis and classification and generate a fast response. Moreover, the Industrial Internet of Things System (IIoTS) should be designed in order to avoid security risks and to have failure tolerance. In addition, we will analyze the type of data generated in the context of Industry 4.0 and the possibilities to handle data based on methods.},

The main objective of this paper is to explore the barriers of Health 4.0 application in healthcare sector in India. Fifteen barriers which can affect the adoption of Health 4.0 in the Indian healthcare sector have been identified through extensive literature review and opinions of healthcare industry and academic experts. A TISM (Total Interpretive Structural Modelling) model has been developed to extract the key barriers influencing Health 4.0 adoption which will guide the healthcare managers and decision makers to explore the effect of each barrier on other barriers as well as the degree of relationships among them. The result shows that lack of top management support, exclusive and skilled workforce requirement, inadequate maintenance support systems and political support are the major barriers as they have strong driving power. Timely action taken by the management to remove these hurdles will not only reduce the cost of medical procedures but also improve the quality of treatment so that the true potential of Health 4.0 can be utilized.},

However, this makes these systems more and more connected and part of a networked system. This can provide an entry point for attackers to infiltrate the system and cause damage with potentially catastrophic consequences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin-based security framework for ICS that consists of two parts: attack detection and attack mitigation. In this framework we deploy an intrusion detection system in digital domain that can detect attacks in a timely manner. Then, using our mitigation method, we keep the system stable with acceptable performance during the attack. Additionally, we implement our framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks.},

While an object is on the move, its operational and surrounding environmental parameters are collected by an edge computing device for local decision. A virtual replica of such object (digital twin) is based in the cloud computing platform and hosts the real-time physical object data, 2D and 3D models, historical data, and bill of materials (BOM) for further processing, analytics, and visualization. This paper proposes an end-to-end digital twin conceptual model that represents its complementary physical object from the ground to the cloud. The paper presents the proposed digital twin model’s multi-layers, namely, physical, communication, virtual space, data analytic and visualization, and application as well as the overlapping security layer. The hardware and software technologies that are used in building such a model will be explained in detail. A use case will be presented to show how the layers collect, exchange, and process the physical object data from the ground to the cloud.},

  abstract       = {There are many Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) applications being used in real manufacturing plants. Digital twins with AI/ML/DL capabilities are among these applications. Steel is an important process industry, where such applications have vast potential to provide positive impacts on different aspects, including energy consumption and cost benefits. The Cognitive Plants Through Proactive Self-Learning Hybrid Digital Twins (CogniTwin) project aims at adding the cognitive elements to the existing process control systems, enabling their capability to self-organise and offer solutions to unpredicted behaviours. In NOKSEL pilot of CogniTwin, the main problem is related to very high costs of machines breakdowns. By developing digital, hybrid and cognitive twins, the pilot aims at reducing energy consumption and average duration of machine downtimes. Cognitive twins for Spiral Welded Steel Pipes (SWP) will enable predictive maintenance at the steel pipe plant. This study briefs the NOKSEL pilot’s purpose, scope, state and the results gained in the 1st year of the project.},

This paper provides a production system lifecycle assessment regarding the technical specification strategies using Virtual Commissioning for implementation and integration of new systems or plants and its predicted future challenges. With the use of standards and a common language practice between a purchaser/contractor procurement situation and across the different technical disciplines internally and externally, the implementation strategies is reiterated to achieve a new sustainable business model. The paper investigates different types of production systems and how a defined classification framework of different levels of Virtual Commissioning can connect the implementation requirements to a desired solution. This strategy includes aspects of standardization, communication, process lifecycle, and predicted cost parameters.},

  abstract       = {The digital era is characterized by fast development, growth, innovation, and disruption. Organizations that want to survive must be ready to adapt to the new digital landscape. The digital transformation process is more than just implementing new technology, investing in tools, or upgrading existing systems. These steps are important, but they are not the whole picture. If an organization wants to stay competitive, it won’t just be able to respond to changes, it should expect them and stimulate innovation itself. To do this, companies need to plan ahead and be active designers for their future. This is where the digital transformation strategy comes in. The digital transformation strategy helps leaders answer the questions for their business such as the current digitalization level, future vision, and how to get there. To be protected from digital disruption, companies need to develop three core competencies related to awareness, informed decision-making, and rapid implementation. The development and implementation of a digital transformation strategy have become a key concern for many organizations across manufacturing industries, but how such a strategy can be developed remains an open question. In this paper, we will be discussing how manufacturing could develop a digital transformation strategy that including a different aspect of the strategy tailored to the nature of the manufacturing sector.},

TIBA will be evaluated though simulations in a large company in the context of Industry 4.0, considering the Product as a Service (PaaS) business model.

Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry.},

The role of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are exploited in the IIoT environment to ensure effective management and computing resource utilization. Based on the SDN and NFV paradigms, this article introduces a novel elastic computing resource virtualization (ECRV) method to improve the flexibility of resource management in the IIoT. The need for virtualization is obtained by identifying the control and process platforms used in industrial task management. Support vector machine-based classification learning is used to achieve balanced identification, and prevents unnecessary distribution of limited resources, Support vector machine helps to retain flexibility in task control processes that use available industrial resources. By separating the process and control platforms, service dissemination is improved and backlogs in task processing are decreased. The proposed method could provide flexible virtualization and reduces the service response time and task failure.},

UAVs have attained a significant interest in supporting many applications such as surveillance, agriculture, communication, transportation, pollution monitoring, disaster management, public safety, healthcare, and environmental preservation. Industry 4.0 applications are conceived of intelligent things that can automatically and collaboratively improve beyond 5G (B5G). Therefore, the Internet of Things (IoT) is required to ensure collaboration between the vast multitude of things efficiently anywhere in real-world applications that are monitored in real-time. However, many IoT devices consume a significant amount of energy when transmitting the collected data from surrounding environments. Due to a drone's capability to fly closer to IoT, UAV technology plays a vital role in greening IoT by transmitting collected data to achieve a sustainable, reliable, eco-friendly Industry 4.0. This survey presents an overview of the techniques and strategies proposed recently to achieve green IoT using UAVs infrastructure for a reliable and sustainable smart world. This survey is different from other attempts in terms of concept, focus, and discussion. Finally, various use cases, challenges, and opportunities regarding green IoT using UAVs are presented.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of life including smart homes, smart cities, agriculture, offices, and workplaces. Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.},

We first point out that the current discourse on 4IR is often based on poor understanding of the true nature of the phenomenon. Emphasising that many of the so-called 4IR technologies have been there and evolving rapidly in the last half a century, we argue that what defines 4IR is the fusion of these technologies. Given this, we argue, rather than trying to master particular 4IR technologies, developing countries should first focus on acquiring what we call the foundational capabilities, i.e. the capabilities to learn new technical and organisational solutions and apply them in creative and flexible ways. Using this perspective, we then discuss in great detail how different 4IR technologies are re-shaping each industry and creating new industries through technological fusion, while discussing how these changes are affecting the opportunities and challenges faced by developing countries for industrial development. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of our findings for industrial policy in developing countries.},

  year  = {2018},
  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is still in its development phase and it promises to bring remarkable benefits to the manufacturing industry around the world when employing the Smart Factory application in large organizations and their supply chains. However, there is a risk of a miss-match when trying to introduce Industry 4.0 to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) as the concept is mainly being developed around large manufacturing companies. The purpose of this research is to analyze the readiness level and feasibility of implementing Industry 4.0 technologies for SME’s in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany). The work is based on the survey of 20 SME’s assessing their current problems emphasizing on automation, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), CAD/CAM, factory layout planning and logistics. Five SME’s from different domains out of the 20 surveyed are taken as case studies to evaluate the potential benefits, trade-offs and barriers from an implementation of these integrated technologies. The findings revealed that the companies are still coping with the issues relating to planning, logistics and automation. It was also found that all the concepts of i4.0 may not be necessary or even beneficial to an enterprise in the current scenario and new strategies need to be developed for its realization in SME’s.},

Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human–machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.},

  abstract       = {Smart contracts are decentrally anchored scripts on blockchains or similar infrastructures that allow the transparent execution of predefined processes. Using smart contracts, business logic can be automated and assets such as money become programmable, which opens up previously inaccessible application potential. To date, smart contracts control billions in value. This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The interrelations between these groups and individual high-impact publications are visualized using social network analysis. A structured overview of the main strands of research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual connections between publications and discourses is obtained. Based on the results, starting points for future research are derived, which offer researchers and practitioners a substantial basis for their work on smart contracts.},

  abstract       = {The digitisation of industry provides a plethora of novel applications that increase flexibility and reduce setup and maintenance time as well as cost. Furthermore, novel use cases are created by the digitisation of industry, commonly known as Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things, applications make use of communication and computation technology that is becoming available. This enables novel business use cases, such as the digital twin, customer individual production, and data market places. However, the inter-connectivity such use cases rely on also significantly increases the attack surface of industrial enterprises. Sabotage and espionage are aimed at data, which is becoming the most crucial asset of an enterprise. Since the requirements on security solutions in industrial networks are inherently different from office networks, novel approaches for intrusion detection need to be developed. In this work, process data of a real water treatment process that contains attacks is analysed. Analysis is performed by an extension of Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series. By extending Matrix Profiles with a Hamming-distance metric, binary and tertiary actuators can be integrated into the analysis in a meaningful fashion.

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 aims at evolving the current industrial processes towards directly connecting shopfloor machines to systems from different layers of the automation pyramid, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). There are key functional and quality requirements that apply to most Industry 4.0 systems independent of the application domain, e.g., requirements related to interoperability, recoverability, security, and modifiability. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of understanding of (i) architecture drivers that focus on these quality aspects and (ii) architecture solutions for these architecture drivers that are adequate for a wide range of Industry 4.0 contexts. To contribute to filling this gap, we present in this paper (i) quality-centered architecture drivers derived from industrial cases, and (ii) architecture solutions based on the concepts of Digital Twins, Service-Oriented Architecture, and Virtual Automation Bus for four recurrent production plant scenarios. The architecture drivers and solutions presented in this paper were instantiated in different Industry 4.0 contexts, such as BaSys 4.0 (the German national reference project for Industry 4.0), and by the BaSys industry project partners.},

Large, dense cities can be highly productive, innovative, and very green per capita, hence ideal for our future. However, the huge influx of new people poses enormous challenges to their administrations. Smart cities are becoming a reality, therefore, to achieve higher efficiency, optimum use of resources, management and to strengthen several features of modern towns, several elements of modern cities are automated and integrated into Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Cities and infrastructure are growing all over the world, in providing end-users with increased performance, comfort, visibility and convenience, the Smart Cities concept is critical. This paper will discuss smart cities and the CPSS concept intensively with some of its key technologies, challenges, and further development by using CPSS.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 mainly refers to factories in which machines use smart and autonomous systems enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and cyber-physical systems. But what reveals the true potential of Industry 4.0 is the established connection and communication between computers and machines that allow making decisions without any human intervention. The network formed by these interconnected machines, and the generated considerable amount of data, marks the actual value of Industry 4.0. Looking at the main features of Industry 4.0, we find many similarities with blockchain technology. The key drivers for Industry 4.0 and blockchain are data management, connectivity and digitization. Additionally, decentralization and distribution are considered as shared architectural features. This paper seeks to open new horizons on the potential of blockchain technology as an empowering tool for the 4th industrial era. We are first investigating the fundamentals of Industry 4.0, its challenges, barriers and limitations, and finally exploring areas where blockchain technology can bring new features and add value to the deployment of Industry 4.0.},

We propose a solution to solve this through a modular framework that automatically recognizes and configures new devices and provides real-time data wirelessly. The proposed framework creates a Digital Twin of the physical device and mirrors its attributes and sensory information into the cyber world so they can be used in real-time and post-routine analysis. As a proof of concept, a configurable CPS model for physical activities monitoring is designed and implemented. The designed gait monitoring and analysis system delivers spatiotemporal data from multiple multi-sensory devices to a central data handling and backup cloud server over conventional IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi.

Today’s pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies continue to evolve as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced computing begin to challenge the traditional approaches, practices, and business models for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. The application of these technologies has the potential to dramatically increase the agility, efficiency, flexibility, and quality of the industrial production of medicines. How these technologies are deployed on the journey from data collection to the hallmark digital maturity of Industry 4.0 will define the next generation of pharmaceutical manufacturing. Acheiving the benefits of this future requires a vision for it and an understanding of the extant regulatory, technical, and logistical barriers to realizing it.},

  abstract       = {Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs) are made of droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (the same material under the screen of our mobile phones) but molded in a spherical shape and hardened into a solid. CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.},

In general, big data has gained a significant attraction in academia and industry to provide valuable business intelligence and evidence-based decisions. This has been a key enabler for the advancement of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in which big data can be leveraged for efficient processing and valuable decisions. Moreover, data acquired from connected vehicles, traffic monitoring, social media feeds, and, crowd-sourcing can strengthen urban development and management. The purpose of this study is to synthesize a systematic review of all related research articles from January 2014 to September 2020 in well-alleged venues. We have rigorously surveyed the research papers to understand potential opportunities, methodologies, and challenges of using big data in IoV. This review shows that big data can play a key role in providing sound and valuable predictions and also provide a comprehensive analysis of several methods, tools, and techniques for the use of big data in IoV. Apart from reviewing the state-of-the-art studies of using big data in IoV, a taxonomy of the said also has been proposed. Furthermore, the article outlined and discussed several key challenges in IoV with notable recommendations and open research dimensions for using big data in IoV.},

The very special payload and exclusive operational profile, i.e. passengers looking for leisure and entertainment, imply outstanding performances in terms of safety standards and customer satisfaction. Attention to environment is relevant as well, since these ships are used to operate in spectacular marine ecosystems. The need of European shipyards to continuously progress to preserve the market leadership requires a virtuous evolution of the ship design process projected on a life cycle perspective. In this regard Systems Engineering appears to be a robust and reliable paradigm, able to provide the necessary comprehensive view of the cruise ship system as a whole together with a systematic methodological framework that, among the other advantages, enables the active and constructive participation of all the involved stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, Systems Engineering strongly relies on the so-called model-based engineering to share, integrate, combine and improve the level of details relevant to the system under development. In this paper the digital twin model will be discussed as a natural evolution of above-mentioned model-based engineering and its utilization in the shipbuilding field will be described as a very promising application especially in the field of cruise ships.},

Industry 4.0, building on the integration of information and communication technologies, Internet of things, robotics, additive manufacturing, and artificial intelligence, aims for developing autonomous and dynamic operations to enable the mass production of highly customized products. Industry 4.0 and quality management share the same objective, that is, improving process performance, yet through different trajectories. However, notwithstanding Industry 4.0 developments, quality management models have remained stagnant and failed to keep abreast of these advancements. This paper evaluates the alignment of quality management models with Industry 4.0. The paper shows that quality models are not congruent with Industry 4.0. The former build on the paradigm that supports establishing formal systems, compliance with specifications, and meeting requirements which are quite irrelevant to Industry 4.0. The paper compares the features of Industry 4.0 against quality models, highlights inadequacies in quality models, and develops recommendations for future quality models. This study is the first to review quality management models in light of the Industry 4.0 developments.},

  abstract       = {Supplier audits are frequently criticized for lacking authenticity and objectivity. Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.},

Based on design science, relevance and rigor for a novel approach are derived. As resulting ‘artifacts’, exemplary supply chains using colored Petri-nets are modeled as a structured and automatable instance for the sketched ‘Token-flow Supply Chains’. For the operation of our visionary scenario, a baseline concept with an associated architecture is drafted.

The study adopts a systematic literature review approach to systematize such knowledge in a singular and consolidated perspective on Industry 4.0 technologies and work. The study analyzes 80 papers in this field and investigates how different Industry 4.0 technologies are related to workers’ manufacturing activities. Eight main manufacturing activities were considered to frame the analysis: assembly, maintenance, training, quality control, movement, machine operation, product and process design, and production planning and control. Eight worker capabilities that Industry 4.0 technologies can enhance were also considered: super-strength capability, augmented capability, virtual capability, healthy capability, smart capability, collaborative, social capability, analytical capability. Based on these 80 papers, this paper conceptualizes Smart Working-related technologies for Operators 4.0 and shows their benefits and limitations as described in the literature. The study shows how these manufacturing activities and worker capabilities can be supported by Industry 4.0 technologies, which is useful for future research and the design of operational processes in the Industry 4.0 context.},

  abstract    = {The exponential growth of the Internet of Things in recent years has created an ever larger cyber attack surface, introducing new security vulnerabilities for all computerized systems. Among the most significant of those systems are industrial control systems (ICS) consisting of many cyber physical components, and smart grids are a prominent example of ICS, whose failures have potential to cause major disruptions in all aspects of our daily lives. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart grid cybersecurity standards, and review major threats to smart grid environments at the physical, network and application layers. In order to overcome the current lack of standards for security evaluation of smart grids, we propose a digital twins based approach for the complete life cycle of a smart grid, which accurately models the functioning of the physical grid and avoids service disruptions caused by running security tests on the actual grid. A digital twins based approach is promising to provide a common ground for the development of standardized models for continuous and comprehensive penetration testing of smart grids.},

We draw on context-rich material from both emergent groups and established organisation. To represent our findings, we introduce the notion of socio-technical dynamics. We derive implications for computer supported cooperative work in crises and disasters. These insights contribute to the efficient involvement of emergent groups in established systems.},

The opportunity is the availability of powerful ICT technologies, that everyone uses every day with smart phones thanks to the well-established and expensive infrastructure provided by tech giants. The necessity is the achievement of Lean transformation in western enterprises through a deep knowledge on manufacturing processes and an incessant training of workforce.

Industry 4.0 will provide us with an integrated holistic view of the manufacturing processes and the possibility to control them according to appropriate forecasts and evaluation of performances and results. Industry 4.0 was born in 2011 and it is in its early stage, there are many research gaps which must be studied and large applications that must be fully integrated in the Industry 4.0 framework.

In this paper a simple application of Industry 4.0 is presented with the aim of demonstrating that, using commercially available open source components, it is possible to integrate different technologies belonging to industry (robotics) and commercial components into one eco-system. Moreover, it integrates different I4.0 enabling technologies namely: Robotics, IoT and fog/edge computing. Finally, the proposed framework can serve as an educational and practical tool for demonstration of Industry 4.0.},

  abstract       = {Abstract As the world races to respond to the diverse and expanding demands for electrochemical energy storage solutions, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) remain the most advanced technology in the battery ecosystem. Even as unprecedented demand for state-of-the-art batteries drives gigascale production around the world, there are increasing calls for next-generation batteries that are safer, more affordable, and energy-dense. These trends motivate the intense pursuit of battery manufacturing processes that are cost effective, scalable, and sustainable.

This approach produces weak intrusion detection systems, as ICS cyber-attacks have a real and significant impact on the process variables. A limited number of researchers consider integrating process measurements. However, in complex systems, process variable changes could result from different combinations of abnormal occurrences. This paper examines recent advances in intrusion detection algorithms, their limitations, challenges and the status of their application in critical infrastructures. We also introduce the discussion on the similarities and conflicts observed in the development of machine learning tools and techniques for fault diagnosis and cybersecurity in the protection of complex systems and the need to establish a clear difference between them. As a case study, we discuss special characteristics in nuclear power control systems and the factors that constraint the direct integration of security algorithms. Moreover, we discuss data reliability issues and present references and direct URL to recent open-source data repositories to aid researchers in developing data-driven ICS intrusion detection systems.},

  abstract       = {Vehicular networks are on the verge of deployment, thanks to the advancements in computation and communication technologies. This breed of ad hoc networks leverages vehicles as nodes with Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication paradigm. Clustering is considered one of the most important techniques used to enhance network stability, reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, clustering employs bandwidth optimization by reducing the overhead and transmission delay and helps in mitigating the hidden node problem. To date, extensive research has been done to address clustering issues in vehicular networks, and several surveys have also been published in the literature. However, a holistic approach towards clustering in vehicular networks is still lacking. In this regard, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent advancements in the clustering schemes for vehicular networks. We take a holistic approach to classify the algorithms by focusing on, (i) the objective of clustering mechanisms (i.e., reliability, scalability, stability, routing overhead, and delay), (ii) general-purpose clustering algorithms, (iii) application-based (i.e., QoS, MAC, security, etc.) clustering, and iv) technology-based clustering (machine learning-based, nature-inspired, fuzzy logic-based and software-defined networking-based clustering). We investigate the existing clustering mechanisms keeping in mind the factors such as cluster formation, maintenance, and management. Additionally, we present a comprehensive set of parameters for selecting cluster heads and the role of enabling technologies for cluster maintenance. Finally, we identify future research trends in clustering techniques for vehicular networks and their various breeds. This survey will act as a one-stop shop for the researchers, practitioners, and system designers to select the right clustering mechanism for their applications, services, or for their research. As a result of this survey, we can see that clustering is heavily dependent on the underlying application, context, environment, and communication paradigm. Furthermore, clustering in vehicular networks can greatly benefit from enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence.},

This paper focuses on a service based interaction of MES and process control in a modular an interconnected environment to promote process optimization. Another important factor that must be considered is security. Linking the industrial automation with IT technologies is a basis for optimization and digitalization but it exposes the system to security threats. Retrieving process information for further data processing and online system optimization including the controlled process must be accomplished via an approach that ensures the security requirements of the system.

Especially in the context of smart factories the connection of the different, heterogeneous production modules through a digital shop floor promises faster conversion rates, data-driven maintenance or automated machine configurations for use cases which haven't been recognized at design time. Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.},

Consequently, fault analysis (e.g., fault detection, diagnosis, and prediction) has attracted increased research attention. Investigations involving fault analysis are usually performed using real-time, online, or automated techniques for fault detection or alarming. Conversely, recovery of faulty states to their healthy forms is usually performed manually under offline conditions. However, the development of intelligent systems requires that appropriate feedback be provided automatically, to facilitate faulty-state recovery without the need for manual operator intervention and/or decision-making. To this end, this paper proposes a system integration technique for predictive process adjustment that determines appropriate recovery actions and performs them automatically by analyzing relevant sensor signals pertaining to the current situation of a manufacturing unit via cloud computing and machine learning. The proposed system corresponds to an automated predictive process adjustment module of an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS). The said integrated module collects and analyzes the temperature and vibration signals of a product transporter using an internet-of-things-based programmable logic controller and cloud computing to identify the current states of the ASRS system. Upon detection of faulty states, the control program identifies corresponding process control variables and controls them to recover the system to its previous no-fault state. The proposed system will facilitate automatic prognostics and health management in complex manufacturing systems by providing automatic fault diagnosis and predictive recovery feedback.},

In this paper, Digital Twin technology is used to provide continuous and diverse insights into the network's behavior, under monitored or artificial network conditions. The twin is constantly connected to the physical network and combines selective simulation, graph algorithms and a data driven link model into a single toolbox. We evaluated its usage for smart lighting applications on a real-life testbed. The results indicate that the twin can produce end-to-end (E2E) latencies, E2E path distributions and a packet delivery ratio comparable to experiment outcomes in the physical network and in compliance with application requirements. Statistical validation of the similarity between measured and predicted E2E latency distributions indicates a Mean Absolute Error &lt; 10 % and a positive discrete Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for all results.},

  abstract       = {Abstract  Cyber-physical systems are hybrid networked cyber and engineered physical elements that record data (e.g. using sensors), analyse them using connected services, influence physical processes and interact with human actors using multi-channel interfaces. Examples of CPS interacting with humans in industrial production environments are the so-called cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), where operators supervise the industrial machines, according to the human-in-the-loop paradigm. In this scenario, research challenges for implementing CPPS resilience, promptly reacting to faults, concern: (i) the complex structure of CPPS, which cannot be addressed as a monolithic system, but as a dynamic ecosystem of single CPS interacting and influencing each other; (ii) the volume, velocity and variety of data (Big Data) on which resilience is based, which call for novel methods and techniques to ensure recovery procedures; (iii) the involvement of human factors in these systems. In this paper, we address the design of resilient cyber-physical production systems (R-CPPS) in digital factories by facing these challenges. Specifically, each component of the R-CPPS is modelled as a smart machine , that is, a cyber-physical system equipped with a set of recovery services, a Sensor Data API used to collect sensor data acquired from the physical side for monitoring the component behaviour, and an operator interface for displaying detected anomalous conditions and notifying necessary recovery actions to on-field operators. A context-based mediator , at shop floor level, is in charge of ensuring resilience by gathering data from the CPPS, selecting the proper recovery actions and invoking corresponding recovery services on the target CPS. Finally, data summarisation and relevance evaluation techniques are used for supporting the identification of anomalous conditions in the presence of high volume and velocity of data collected through the Sensor Data API. The approach is validated in a food industry real case study.},

These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.},

The increase in the penetration of IoT has opened the doors for attackers with now even more surface area prone to attacks. The more machines connected the more the data is exchanged which implies more exposure of information which could be confidential and sensitive. Manufacturing units are the first line of defense in safeguarding a country’s capabilities. The information leaked through these channels is not only economically disastrous but also a serious concern for the security of a nation. There is a growing need to keep a check on the information that could be leaked. Cybersecurity plays an important role in preventing the misuse of the data collected through millions of devices nowadays. First, there is a need to spread awareness about the implications of data theft in the manufacturing environment and then understanding the need for cybersecurity in this environment.},

A model capable of facilitating the use of construction information in the proposed framework was developed to implement the proposed framework into practice. Combining the BIM model within the framework provides all project stakeholders with prerequisite information needed for a building's configuration. This collaborative process utilises an algorithmic composition in which the current assembly information in both the BIM model and framework is used as a controlling factor in the configuration process. The parametric environment of Revit and the algorithmic environment of the Dynamo plugin were used to realise the proposed framework (as a proof of concept).},

Many virtual systems allow to predict foul conditions, save energy, study special cases, and so on, yet they need to implement new digital tools that allow developing manufacturing process in a better manner. As a result, Digital-Twin platforms are a good alternative since they are virtual models that could receive online and offline data. Thus, programmed algorithms can be evaluated to know the performance of the manufacturing process. These virtualizations and interconnections between elements of the manufacturing process become important components with an increasing role in dealing with supply, production times, and delivery chains as they run in parallel and find optimal performance before implementing these conditions into the real system. This study focuses on the use of a Digital-Twin that integrates a metaheuristic optimization and a direct Simulink model for printed circuit boards (PCB) design and processing focused on the drilling process. The results show that metaheuristic optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin concept as part of the production system into the drilling process. In the first part, it shows that depending on the penalization the optimization focuses on the lower path and forgets on changing the tools, yet as the penalization raises it focuses on finishing drilling with one tool before changing. Second, it is important where on the PCB it starts the drilling, with less time depending on each plaque. Third, it can be observed that using optimization can triple the amount of PCBs that can be manufactured. Finally, on an 8-hr run the Digital-Twin that didn’t use optimization can only work with three different designs, differently with optimization it can have 7-8 changes in the PCB design.},

  abstract       = {How to reach an agreement in a blockchain network is a complex and important task that is defined as a consensus problem and has wide applications in reality including distributed computing, load balancing, and transaction validation in blockchains. Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.},

The recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, has led to an increase in the demand for instant messaging and videoconferencing. There has been the need to maximize the availability of messaging, and mostly videoconference platforms. These platforms provide end-to-end communications services. Organizations have asked staff to work from home which necessitates work from home as well as meeting up with regular work schedule meetings which are carried out via these platforms mentioned. Communication Networks provide channels for such tasks to be carried out. These networks are used for the transmission for a wide range of valuable and confidential information. As a result, they draw the interest of persons who want to intercept or manipulate data or interrupt or damage the storage or communication of the networks. In this study a review of security as it pertains end-to-end connection is presented, we looked at a brief background of the issues which includes a description of security engineering with attendant examples, made our findings and observations. The paper ends with a brief in the form of a case study of a few ICT firms that provide end-to-end services. Such services fall into the category of instant messaging (IM), videoconferencing and remote management, showing how much they value end-to-end encryption and the impact it could have on their businesses.},

  abstract       = {Smart-Manufacturing systems are increasingly being used to perform complex tasks on the factory floor. Most often, these systems have hard-coded cases to achieve a specific set of actions -or to assure the safety of the operations. The hard-coding makes the use complicated to re-deploy a system for different tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to have a flexible framework, which can generate a plan based on an intuitive description with system constraints, while satisfying all safety conditions. In this work, we propose Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)-based autonomy framework for smart-manufacturing systems. Specifically, we describe a general technique for formulating problems using LTL specifications. The use of LTL enables us to specify a manufacturing scenario (e.g. assembly), along with system constraints, as well as assured autonomy. Based on the given LTL formulation, a safe solution satisfying all constraints can be generated using a satisfiability solver. To eliminate the exhaustive and exponential nature of the solver, we reduced the exploration space with a divide and conquer approach in a receding horizon, which brings dramatic improvements in time and enables our solution for real-world applications. Our experimental evaluations indicated that our solution scales linearly as the problem complexity increases. We showcased the feasibility of our approach by integrating TLbased autonomy with the simulations of Gantry robot in Siemens NX Mechatronics Concept Designer and TIA Portal (PLCSIM Advanced) for Siemens S7-1500 TCPU connected to Sinamics drives.},

This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0 Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions.

In order to accurately identify the key nodes of high-speed railway and further improve the protection ability, we carried out the data mining on the two aspects of supply and demand of high-speed railway. Considering the functional characteristics of high-speed railway transportation and the imbalance between supply and demand, the paper analyzesd the complex network of high-speed railway, which is first upgraded to the directed transportation network and then reduced to the undirected hierarchical network. And the marginal utility model and the competitive opportunity gravity model were used as the supply and demand indexes, and the comprehensive analysis of high-speed railway network is carried out by the method of comprehensive quantification of damage utility to quantify the protection priority value of the network system. The results of case analysis showed that the difference of network demand was obvious, and the fluctuation of supply difference was small. Compared with single analysis, the comprehensive analysis result was more accurate and instructive, which reduced the mistake of subjective judgment based on previous empiricism due to the limitation of people's consciousness, and provided theoretical basis for the decision-making of high-speed railway network protection priority and the allocation of protection resources.},

The main contribution of this paper is a model checking technique for usage automata. The model is that of usages , i.e. basic processes that describe the possible patterns of resource access and creation. In spite of the model having infinite states, because of recursion and resource creation, we devise a polynomial-time model checking technique for deciding when a usage complies with a usage policy.},

CPS are a unique class of intelligent system, where the governing process models for the system (or its parts) are available to inform decision making. The governing physics or chemistry models provide an additional source of information, potentially improving the accuracy of CPS modeling, but also increasing the complexity of the information fusion process. The resource constraints of CPS, however, makes it hard to perform the information fusion within the CPS itself. Moreover, building a large, monolithic model of the complete CPS is also infeasible due to model size and training complexity. The hierarchical and compositional structure of CPS calls for distributed model training and composition. Resource constraints and real-time control needs call for rapid and low-cost training of models, which makes surrogate modeling a promising approach. However, when surrogate models are composed, their approximate nature may lead to larger errors. Further, data-driven models are prone to adversarial attacks, whose impacts may be even more pronounced in a federated model. This position paper highlights the key research challenges in this realm and need for new research.},

In addition, manufacturers (process industries such as refineries, processing plants, metal producers, paper mills, pharmaceutical plants, or oil and gas producers) must adhere to increasing governmental safety and environmental compliance regulations. This chapter discusses how most of these issues can be addressed through intelligent use of real-time operating data continuously collected from their production facilities. It advocates the use of a data-driven strategy to optimize operational efficiency and maintenance and enable business personnel to quickly and easily take corrective action when abnormal conditions occur. By taking corrective actions in real time, unnecessary costs can be avoided, bottom line profitability is increased, employee safety is maintained, and responsible environmental stewardship is achieved. The strategy uses real-time data infrastructure software as the integration layer between production process control systems (operational technology), business systems, and advanced offline analytics (information technology).},

This paper presents a smart execution control framework for enabling the autonomous operation of flexible mobile robot workers. These robot resources are able to autonomously navigate the shopfloor, undertaking multiple operations while acting as assistants to human operators. To enable this autonomous behavior, the proposed framework integrates robot perception functions for the real-time shopfloor and process understanding while orchestrating the process execution. A Digital World Model is deployed synthesizing the sensor data coming from multiple 2D and 3D sensors from the shopfloor. This model is consumed for the perception functions enabling the real-time shopfloor and process perception by the robot workers. This smart control system has been applied and validated in a case study from the automotive sector.},

The concept industry 4.0 was first brought up in Germany. With the promises of the concept and increasing demand in cost effectiveness, flexibility, and sustainability, industry 4.0 has drawn considerable interest globally. The industry 4.0 era will lead to breakthrough chances in the business world. As the technologies of this era enable ubiquitous presence and real time information about each single piece of a process, it has been used in many firms in developed countries for some time. It is apparent that this new era will cause significant changes in our lives. Concepts of this new era such as cyber physical systems and internet of things have already gained considerable interest. Technologies that will be used widespread in the new future offer big opportunities for cost reduction and assessment of operations. Thus, the emerging developments in technology are closely followed especially by the logistics sector. Industry 4.0 involves numerous technologies and related paradigms (Thames & Schaefer, 2016). In this chapter, after a brief description of digitalization and industry 4.0, some main industry 4.0 technologies used in the logistics sector will be explained. Consequently, the advantages and disadvantages, and the possible opportunities and threats for the logistics sector will be discussed. Finally the current situation of logistics firms all over the world and specifically in Turkey will be discussed.},

Its outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication, consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing.},

It starts with an introduction of Industry 4.0 concept and an understanding of AI use in this context. Then provides elements of security principles and detection techniques applied to operational technology (OT) which forms the main attack surface of manufacturing systems. As some intrusion detection systems (IDS) already involve some AI-based techniques, we focus on existing machine-learning and data-mining based techniques in use for intrusion detection. This article presents the major strengths and weaknesses of the main techniques in use. We also discuss an assessment of their relevance for application to OT, from the manufacturer point of view. Another part of the paper introduces the essential drivers and principles of Industry 4.0, providing insights on the advent of AI in manufacturing systems as well as an understanding of the new set of challenges it implies. AI-based techniques for production monitoring, optimisation and control are proposed with insights on several application cases. The related technical, operational and security challenges are discussed and an understanding of the impact of such transition on current security practices is then provided in more details. The final part of the report further develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0. It addresses aspects of orchestration of distributed detection techniques, introduces an approach to adversarial/robust AI development and concludes with human–machine behaviour monitoring requirements.},

Management of systemic threats requires a paradigm shift from static risk assessment to holistic resilience modeling and evaluation using intelligent, data-driven and run-time approaches. In fact, the complexity and criticality of HCPS requires timely decisions considering many parameters and implications, which in turn require the adoption of advanced monitoring frameworks and evaluation tools. In order to tackle such challenge, we introduce those new paradigms in a framework named RESILTRON, envisioning Digital Twins (DT) to support decision making and improve resilience in HCPS under systemic stress. In order to represent possibly complex and heterogeneous HCPS, together with their environment and stressors, we leverage on multi-simulation approaches, combining multiple formalisms, data-driven approaches and Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling paradigms, through a structured, modular and compositional framework. DT are used to provide an adaptive abstract representation of the system in terms of multi-layered spatially-embedded dynamic networks, and to apply self-adaptation to time-warped What-If analyses, in order to find the best sequence of decisions to ensure resilience under uncertainty and continuous HPCS evolution.},

The experiment includes typical manufacturing processes with machine failures, which should be detected and recognized to invoke both simulations for re-forecast and error management.},

Based on the ever-faster emergence and adoption of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, or augmented reality, digitalization irreversibly changes our private lives and organizational routines from all industries on a global scale. Thereby, digitalization develops unlimited potential in terms of innovation, connectivity, efficiency and productivity improvements. However, research and practice still lack a fundamental understanding of the nature of digital technologies. To address this gap, we developed a multi-layer taxonomy of digital technologies that includes eight dimensions structured along the layers of established modular architectures, i.e. service, content, network, and device. Based on our taxonomy, we also identified seven archetypes of digital technologies by means of a cluster analysis. To revise and evaluate our artefacts, we classified 45 digital technologies from the Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies and conducted evaluation rounds with other researchers. Our results contribute to the descriptive knowledge on digital technologies. They enable researchers and practitioners to classify digital technologies on two levels of aggregation and to make informed decisions about their adoption.},

  abstract       = {Driven by digitalization and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ‘war for talents’ is increasingly shifting towards the digital world, transforming traditional personnel selection systems into information systems. While these digital personnel selection systems (DPSSs) make use of video interviews or gamified assessments to realize benefits in terms of cost-efficiency and sustainability, the use of digital technologies has a significant impact on user behaviors and selection outcomes. Against this backdrop, we present a common, interdisciplinary conceptualization of DPSSs in terms of a framework for technology-driven factors, which we inferred from a systematic literature review. Our interview-based evaluation showed that such an overview is urgently needed in research and practice. Our findings represent a theory for analyzing and add to the descriptive knowledge by providing an information systems lens on personnel selection. With this understanding of technology-driven factors, we provide a profound basis for developing user-centric DPSSs.},

A huge set of automatic learning frameworks tackle different kinds of systems, enabling the diffusion of Big Data analysis, cloud computing systems and (Industrial) Internet of Things. As such applications become more and more widespread, data analysis techniques have shown their capability to identify operational patterns and to predict future behaviours for anticipating possible problems. Knowledge outcoming from these approaches are still hard to manipulate with high-level reasoning mechanisms (formal reasoning, model checking, model-based approaches): this special issue aims at exploring the synergy of model-based and data-driven approaches to boost critical applications and systems analysis and monitoring.},

Often the products have to fulfil safety requirements with the effect that a lack of quality is absolutely not tolerable. At all, over changes and internationalization activities big enterprises and their products have to be completely state of the art. In complex products this demands are very difficult to satisfy and partly not realistic with classical methods of statistical process control (SPC). The following article presents SPC 4.0 with the focus on Automation at the age of industry 4.0. That means: 100% data acquisition in complex processes on any characteristics necessary, in-line-capability, data everywhere available (world-wide), reliability as well as comparability for any statistical use or in cases of obligation to provide proof. Overall, the chances and challenges of trends in digitalization are figured out.},

The dream is not just an illusion but also a natural result of the two most important technologies of today: artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). AI deals with the creation of systems that can learn to mimic human functions, using their previous experience and without any manual intervention. AI refers to analytical methods in the execution of certain tasks, which can replace human intelligence. AI helps computers to learn from experience, adapts to new inputs, and performs tasks of a human nature. From research labs to your living room, AI now lives everywhere. AI has already taken jobs from humans and will continue to do so as it becomes wider and more successful. On the other hand, the IoT is a network of various devices that are linked over the internet and that can capture and exchange data among themselves. IoT helps the devices/objects to observe, identify, and understand a situation or environment without being dependent on human assistance. From everyday objects like kitchen appliances, vehicles, thermostats, and baby monitors to everything else is connected to the Internet through embedded devices.},

  abstract       = {A system paradigm is a typical pattern or model of enterprise architectures (EAs) that describes constitutive system elements and their relations in achieving missions and goals of enterprises. A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example. The rationales and significances of DT-II and IoDTT as well as future research directions of DM are summarized as a conclusion.},

  abstract       = {The Digital Twin concept represents an innovative method to monitor and predict the performance of an aircraft’s various subsystems. By creating ultra-realistic multi-physical computational models associated with each unique aircraft and combining them with known flight histories, operators could benefit from a real-time understanding of the vehicle’s current capabilities. One important facet of the Digital Twin program is the detection and monitoring of structural damage. Recently, a method to detect fatigue cracks using the transformation response of shape memory alloy (SMA) particles embedded in the aircraft structure has been proposed. By detecting changes in the mechanical and/or electromagnetic responses of embedded particles, operators could detect the onset of fatigue cracks in the vicinity of these particles. In this work, the development of a finite element model of an aircraft wing containing embedded SMA particles in key regions will be discussed. In particular, this model will feature a technique known as substructure analysis, which retains degrees of freedom at specified points key to scale transitions, greatly reducing computational cost. By using this technique to model an aircraft wing subjected to loading experienced during flight, we can simulate the response of these localized particles while also reducing computation time. This new model serves to demonstrate key aspects of this detection technique. Future work, including the determination of the material properties associated with these particles as well as exploring the positioning of these particles for optimal crack detection, is also discussed.},

  abstract    = {Providing Complex Cyber-Physical Systems (C-CPSs) more efficiently and faster is a goal that requires improvements in engineering process for producing high-quality, advanced engineering artifacts. Furthermore, information security must be a top priority when engineering C-CPSs as the engineering artifacts represent assets of high value.

This chapter overviews the engineering process of C-CPSs, typically long-running technical systems, such as industrial manufacturing systems and continuous processing systems. This chapter also covers major areas of requirements that include: (a) processes with intensive generation of engineering artifacts; (b) challenges regarding dependencies and complexity of engineering artifacts, stemming from variants of a product and the associated production process for a family of products; (c) management of model and consistency rules for dependencies between model parts; (d) the internationalization of the engineering process with partners on different levels of trust; and (e) the security of the engineering processes, such as confidentiality of engineering plans, and the security of the systems to be engineered, such as security aspects in the design phase.

For selected requirement areas, the chapter discusses several approaches for quality improvement from business informatics that addresses important classes of requirements, but introduces new complexity to the engineering process. Therefore, the chapter reviews information security improvement approaches for engineering processes, including the consideration of new security requirements stemming from risks introduced by advanced informatics solutions. Finally, the chapter provides an overview on the book parts and the contributions of the chapters to address advanced engineering process requirements.},

This proposal takes a novel approach by exploring the application of user model-based personalization for AR/VR systems to improve accessibility. The workshop will be organized by experienced researchers in the field of human computer interaction, robotics control, assistive technology, and AR/VR systems, and will consist of peer reviewed papers and hands-on demonstrations.

  abstract    = {Industrial control systems (ICSs), and particularly supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, are used in many critical infrastructures and are inherently insecure, making them desirable targets for attackers. ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system’s topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0–1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.},

It provides standards for communication and interaction with Things in the IoT in order to address IoT cross-domain and cross-platform interoperability problems and reduce its fragmentation. WoT uses a formal interface description called Thing Description (TD) which describes the offerings of Things to allow the interaction in between Things. Although Things undergo changes with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications during their lifetime, the WoT TD is currently inteded to be of a static nature. This remains contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things along their lifecycle. This work researches the lifecycle aspect for Things in the IoT and the different stakeholders influencing Things and respectively their TD. These two concepts were combined to develop a versioning mechanism for a TD through the lifecycle of a Thing.},

  abstract       = {Resource scarcity is a global challenge, especially in E-mobility. Currently, Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as an attractive option on a pathway towards low emission mobility. Nevertheless, due to the increasing sales and acceptance of EVs, new challenges arise regarding the scarcity of utilized materials, especially regarding lithium-ion battery systems. Battery production is responsible for the major share of the environmental and economical impacts of the overall EV production. In order to tackle these challenges, resource-efficient processes and a circular use are necessary. Today, a variety of new Industry 4.0 technologies (such as high integrated production systems) are affordable and have reached maturity. Like Industry 4.0, also Recycling 4.0 aims at digitalization of processes but with the focus on the End of Life stage of products. The main goal of the German research project Recycling 4.0 is to develop approaches, which enable advanced information creation, transfer and use along the entire supply chain. In this work, a holistic approach towards an advanced circular economy (Recycling 4.0) is shown. This approach combines methods from different areas (such as economics, mechanical engineering, and computer science) and paves the way towards an advanced circular economy. This paper introduces this approach by discussing the current situation of EV recycling and related judicial fundamentals. Furthermore, the overall approach is introduced, and the discipline-specific sub-approaches are discussed in detail.},

In particular, we need an understanding of how digital resilience enables individuals, organizations and societies to respond to threats such as the pandemic. This panel aims to create a conversation with the broader Information Systems community to: (1) Create a deeper understanding of the concept of digital resilience in the face of existential threats, as opposed to digital resilience in the face of organizational change; (2) Share key learnings of research on digital resilience with the IS community; and (3) Discuss key issues and research questions that are important to examine to improve our understanding of digital resilience.},

  abstract       = {Faster optimization algorithms, increased computer power and amount of available data, can leverage the area of simulation towards real-time control and optimization of products and production systems. This concept — often referred to as Digital Twin — enables real-time geometry assurance and allows moving from mass production to more individualized production. To master the challenges of a Digital Twin for Geometry Assurance the project Smart Assembly 4.0 gathers Swedish researchers within product development, automation, virtual manufacturing, control theory, data analysis and machine learning. The vision of Smart Assembly 4.0 is the autonomous, self-optimizing robotized assembly factory, which maximizes quality and throughput, while keeping flexibility and reducing cost, by a sensing, thinking and acting strategy. The concept is based on active part matching and self-adjusting equipment which improves geometric quality without tightening the tolerances of incoming parts. The goal is to assemble products with higher quality than the incoming parts. The concept utilizes information about individual parts to be joined (sensing), selects the best combination of parts (thinking) and adjust locator positions, clamps, weld/rivet positions and sequences (acting). The project is ongoing, and this paper specifies and highlights the infrastructure, components and data flows necessary in the Digital Twin in order to realize Smart Assembly 4.0. The framework is generic, but the paper focuses on a spot weld station where two robots join two sheet metal parts in an adjustable fixture.},

The paper focuses on the current research challenges and opportunities in the area of measurement. Measurement challenges lie at the heart of modern simulation. They directly impact how we use simulation outcomes for automated online and semi-automated offline decision making. Measurements also encompas how we verify and validate those outcomes. Modern simulation systems are increasingly becoming more like cyber cyber digital twins, effectively moving from manual to automated decision making, hence, these measurement challenges acquire ever greater significance.},

  volume         = {114},
  abstract       = {As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.},

In the field of methodologies to profile and monitor emerging technologies the role of Wikipedia has been recently explored. In this paper we extend the use of Wikipedia by comparing the German edition with the world largest edition (in English) in order to examine whether there are significant structural differences. We first validate the use of Wikipedia for emerging technologies and for cross-language comparisons as a tool for (almost) real time strategic analysis. We then extract all Wikipedia pages related to Industry 4.0, build up a knowledge network and study its topological properties in the two editions. We find striking differences, which can be explained with respect to the persistence of the industrial pattern of specialization of Germany with respect to all other countries. Emerging technologies introduce novelty but also preserve path-dependency in the pattern of specialization. The implications for companies and policy makers are discussed.},

ARTI models architecture elements of reality as intelligent beings in a dominant position relative to their related decision-making components modelled as intelligent agents. The reviews start with overviews of the creation process, the structural elements - holon classes and the features - aggregation, specialization, abstraction levels, flexibility and scalability. The needs that led to the evolution of PROSA into ARTI are analysed: the difficulties to spread the architecture in the research community and industry, the lack of suitability to act as reference architecture for Cyber-Physical Production Systems and Industrial Internet of Things framework in the Industry 4.0 vision of future manufacturing. The reviews discuss the elements and coverage of ARTI, and the translation of basic and staff PROSA holons into new abstract categories: intelligent beings-agents, types-instances, and resources-activities. It is appreciated that, beyond the problem of terminology of PROSA holons difficult to apply in other domains than manufacturing, the move to ARTI assures in-depth interoperability, access to the world-of-interest through digital twins that interact with smart control systems influencing thus these intelligent beings (e.g., plant, shop floor, healthcare system, environment facility, supply chain, service system) into the desired behaviours. From the software implementing point of view, most of the reviewers agreed on the fact that none of the programming languages except for Erlang provided acceptable levels of viability and sustainability for PROSA application classes. An interesting point of view is formulated about the possibility to use ARTI for Enterprise Integration and Interoperability. The present discussions appreciates the new ARTI reference architecture together with D-MAS pattern as an enhanced model to build flexible, intelligent and robust control systems based on prioritizing situation awareness and real-world interoperability. This scientific discussion about the new ARTI model, initiated, presented and critically analysed for the first time in the SOHOMA scientific community needs to be continued by the research community for enrichment and industry adoption.},

  abstract    = {This chapter discusses the threat arising from within the organisation, whether from negligence, malice, or exploitation by an external party. The trusted insider is one of the greatest challenges facing organisations today. The analysis considers the balance to be struck between allowing insiders access and privileges to show trust and increase productivity, and securing that access at the cost of good will and with an increased risk of workarounds being found, placing vulnerabilities at the heart of an organisation’s policies and processes. The tactics of social engineering and exploitation of human psychology to compromise or completely bypass technical and procedural security measures are considered, along with the effectiveness of training and difficulties of raising cultural awareness of security on a long term basis in a rapidly changing technological landscape.},

Building a huge infrastructure for the verification purposes is often too costly and impractical in the production environment therefore it is necessary to find other ways to test architectural approaches and algorithms. One of them is simulators. For simulating very big systems like a telecommunications radio access network the simulator should have certain features: capability of simulating a huge number of services, possibility to model heterogenic and vast network, facility to add a new type of services and logic. This paper presents a concept of such a simulator of services.},

  abstract       = {Digitalization currently exerts a considerable impact on competitiveness within the market. Digital transformation happens within a company after three basic stages: operational processes, customer experience, and business models. The article considers the digital transformation of business models particularly within the retail sector, using a comparative analysis of platforms (ecosystems) and traditional business models. On the one hand, digital platforms provide favourable opportunities; on the other hand, they challenge market monopolization. Digital platforms have generated new types of businesses; as an example, platform-based companies have empowered new value chain sources and a competitive environment. The article establishes the definitions and characteristics of business platform models, and points out the advantages and challenges with which the retail market is faced, as well as the benefits that ecosystem participants enjoy. The author emphasizes the significance of ecosystems that allow value to increase without the owner’s participation. Ecosystems are time and labour saving, thus offer endless opportunities. In conclusion, the author points out that digital technologies and virtual companies transform conventional retail businesses, driving up the popularity of omnichannel business models. Furthermore, introducing business platforms requires considerable changes in management, otherwise this can be undermined.},

This chapter examines the latest digital approach to the oil and gas industry that is the enabler to connected metering. Connected metering is digital transformation that is emerging for Industrial Internet of Things in which ubiquitous connectivity is coupled to cloud-borne data analytics and storage systems in enhancing metering accuracy and reliability. Metering has seen a tremendous growth since its early introduction in the 1800s in terms of both technology and market size. Connectivity is that enabled by the digital economy and its ubiquitous connectivity. Condition based monitoring is largely operating within the oil and gas industry as a stranded asset and typically for ultrasonic meters. A positive-unexpected consequence of collecting data within a digitization strategy is that further subsets of data may be readily formed from the larger master data sets bringing about new insights.},

  abstract       = {For most car and truck manufacturers access to information about the status of produced vehicles end with their sale. With embedded connectivity units this changes so that manufacturers can gather data from vehicle in-build sensors and thus, gain insights into each products usage. Our study investigates why manufacturers aim to integrate connectivity units into their products to gather sensor based usage information and what hinders them to do so. Thereby, we aim to identify the factors that have an influence on the decision of vehicle manufacturers to adopt the concept of the vehicle digital twin. To unveil those factors, we conducted 30 expert interviews at two vehicle manufacturers in which we found benefits and barriers regarding the realization of a product digital twin. By conceptualizing the benefits and barriers, which have a positive or negative influence on the adoption decision from the perspective of the manufacturers, we were able to derive general influences on the adoption decision. In our adapted technology-organization-environment framework we found influences in the technological (i.e. product data and product heterogeneity), the organizational (i.e. business model orientation, readiness of internal processes and digital culture) and the environmental (i.e. competitors behaviour, legal regulations and customer demand) dimension.},

Nonetheless, manufacturers’ Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Information Systems (IS) do not integrate these product instance data. Furthermore, existing PLM IS do not support product related tasks after the manufacturing phase. In order to understand the impact of data from connected products as new sources of information on PLM, we conducted a systematic literature review. Our results led to a topic map that identifies drivers, use cases and barriers and contextualizes them. We further analyzed existing PLM models that support the analysis of product instance data. We found that the existing PLM IS have several limitations which hinder a successful realization in practice. The results of this review are a first step towards understanding how the Internet of Things (IoT) influences PLM on a firm level.},

Digital technology enables transactions and planning to be undertaken more quickly, more accurately and with greater confidence. New technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), enable new levels of efficiency with machines talking directly to machines. These developments help tackle the challenges in the food production supply chain, by providing new technologies to drive immutable traceability, sustainability, reduce waste and underpin food security.},

In this sense, the paper discusses what types of surrogate models are suitable for different practical problems as well as introduces the appropriate techniques for building and using these models. A number of examples of digital twin applications from both continuous processes and discrete manufacturing are presented to underline the potentials of utilising surrogate models. The surrogate models and model-building methods are categorised according to the area of applications. The importance of keeping these models up to date through their whole model life cycle is also highlighted. An industrial case study is also presented to demonstrate the applicability of the concept.},

Usually, such blockchain solutions claim to be disruptive. Often, such disruptiveness takes the form of a proclaimed blockchain revolution. In this paper, we want to look at blockchain technology from a neutral, analytical perspective. Our aim is to understand technological and socio-economic barriers to blockchain solutions that are intrinsic in the blockchain technology stack itself. We look into the permissionless blockchain as well as the permissioned blockchain. We start with a characterization of cryptocurrency as one-tiered uncollateralized M1 money. We proceed with defining essential modes of business communications (message authentication, signature, registered letter, contract, order etc.) and how they are digitized classically. We review potential blockchain solutions for these modes of communications, including socio-economic considerations. At the technical level, we discuss scalability issues and potential denial-of-service attacks. On the other hand, we also look into four successful blockchain solutions and explain their design. Now: what is the blockchain revolution and how realistic is it? Will it shake up of our institutions? Or, vice versa: does it have to rely on a re-design of our institutions instead? Can we design useful blockchain solutions independent of fundamental institutional re-design? It is such questions which have motivated us to compile this paper and we hope that we are able to bring some light to them.},

The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

Therefore, Fog Computing has been proposed to be an edge component for the IoT networks as a remedy to this problem. In recent times, cyber-attacks are on the rise, especially towards infrastructure-less networks, such as IoT. Many botnet attack variants (Mirai, Torii, etc.) have shown that the tiny microdevices at the lower spectrum of the network are becoming a valued participant of a botnet, for further executing more sophisticated attacks against infrastructural networks. As such, the fog devices also need to be secured against cyber-attacks, not only software-wise, but also from hardware alterations and manipulations. Hence, this article first highlights the importance and benefits of fog computing for IoT networks, then investigates the means of providing hardware security to these devices with an enriched literature review, including but not limited to Hardware Security Module, Physically Unclonable Function, System on a Chip, and Tamper Resistant Memory.},

  abstract       = {A new emerging frontier in the evolution of the digitalisation and the 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is considered to be that of “Biologicalisation in Manufacturing. This has been defined by the authors to be “The use and integration of biological and bio-inspired principles, materials, functions, structures and resources for intelligent and sustainable manufacturing technologies and systems with the aim of achieving their full potential. In this White Paper, detailed consideration is given to the meaning and implications of “Biologicalisation from the perspective of the design, function and operation of products, manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, supply chains and organisations. The drivers and influencing factors are also reviewed in detail and in the context of significant developments in materials science and engineering. The paper attempts to test the hypothesis of this topic as a breaking new frontier and to provide a vision for the development of manufacturing science and technology from the perspective of incorporating inspiration from biological systems. Seven recommendations are delivered aimed at policy makers, at funding agencies, at the manufacturing research community and at those industries involved in the development of next generation manufacturing technology and systems. It is concluded that it is valid to argue that Biologicalisation in Manufacturing truly represents a new and breaking frontier of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 and that the market potential is very strong. It is evident that extensive research and development is required in order to maximise on the benefits of a biological transformation.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {This paper reports on a highly ambitious international study undertaken in the period 2018–2020 on the topic of convergence between biology and advanced manufacturing systems. The international team (authors of this paper) worked together to analyse the status of this convergence through the assessment of concrete examples, referred to here as demonstrators, within advanced manufacturing systems. Four independent demonstrators from different sections of the manufacturing value chain and involving bio-inspiration, bio-integration and/or bio-intelligence were selected to test the following hypothesis: “That Future Manufacturing Systems will incorporate Components, Features, Characteristics and Capabilities that enable the convergence towards Living Systems. Each of these four demonstrators have succeeded in supporting this hypothesis and in providing clear evidence to confirm that significant performance benefits may be derived through the “biologicalisation of advanced manufacturing systems. This conclusion is of great significance for the next phases of development of manufacturing science and engineering globally. The evidence reported in this paper provides a robust basis for recommending that a deeper analysis of the implications of biologicalised manufacturing systems be undertaken. As a result of this early stage work, it is concluded that there is a high likelihood that this new convergence will lead to a major paradigm shift in advanced manufacturing. Outstanding opportunities exist for high levels of innovation in the next stages of development of advanced manufacturing processes and systems from the biological perspective. The relationship between the human and the physical manufacturing system will also change and the world of advanced manufacturing will be confronted with many new challenges including important ethical questions.},

This chapter aims to highlight the role of each function within Industry 4.0. Moreover, the chapter will determine the actualized benefit of transitioning towards Industry 4.0, separate from the recognized benefits under the literature. In order to achieve this a content analysis was conducted on the 2017 annual activity reports of manufacturing firms listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST). Out of the 178 listed manufacturing firms under BIST, only 20 were identified as transitioning towards Industry 4.0. Out of these 20 firms, 16 firms’ annual activity reports mentioned transitioning towards Industry 4.0 and addressed the outcome (benefits) of the applications. Items were subjected to a content analysis based on business functions (Theme 1), sub-categories of business functions (Theme 2) and the common actual benefit (Theme 3) by three different researchers. The unit of analysis, the identified benefits, were 232 items in total and spread across the operations (41%), strategic management (Cost and Competitive Advantage) (22%), technology and process development (15%), procurement and distribution (12%), human resources (8%) and marketing (2%) business functions.},

  abstract       = {Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.},

  abstract       = {The electrical energy system is transforming itself into a sustainable energy supply in response to the decline in fossil fuels. This conversion is driving the expansion of renewable energy facilities such as photovoltaic plants and wind power plants. Except for large hydropower plants and offshore wind farms, the integration of renewable energies takes place predominantly in the medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. This leads to a lack of observability and increasing grid complexity. Consequently, distribution network operators are constantly faced with a challenge in terms of observability. A comprehensive installation of measuring instruments in the medium- and low-voltage networks has proved economically unviable. An alternative approach to network state monitoring within the framework of power grid digital twin (DT) is therefore developed in this paper. The patterns of the electrical energy system are detected and modeled employing an artificial neural network (ANN) in connection with the associated harmonic spectra. Based on this DT model, the active powers of renewable energy facilities are estimated through the measured voltage data. In this regard, this work is first devoted to the modeling of an ANN-based DT estimator. The proposed power state estimation is then validated with the measured data from a field test. The accuracy of the estimation will be investigated according to the different influencing factors.},

Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resource being protected and be generated dynamically by resources depending on the context in which the resource is being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.},

Such data have the purpose to feed mobility monitoring and transport planning solutions. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is developed to validate the framework under realistic experimental settings. Results in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of the considered messaging protocols are reported.},

  abstract       = {Today’s digital world and evolving technology has improved the quality of our lives but it has also come with a number of new threats. In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.},

For instance, they can accurately superimpose the face of an individual over the body an actor in a destination video (i.e., face swap), or exactly reproduce the voice of a person and speak a given text. As a result, many are concerned with the potential risks in terms of cybersecurity. Although most focused on the malicious applications of this technology, in this paper we propose a system for using deepfakes for beneficial purposes. We describe the potential use and benefits of our proposal and we discuss its implications in terms of human factors, security risks, and ethical aspects.},

During the past decades, there were major changes in the energy industry: the increased implementation of renewable generation, together with a greater use of electronic power elements in the network such as high-voltage DC links and the use of flexible AC transmission system and new market requirements, introduce new challenges and a need for more intelligent assets monitoring; and additional optimisation with a better balance in the combination of different energy sources and thus guaranteeing the reliability of supply and quality of energy; together with the identification of new business models that allow the integration of new technologies, neutralising cyber threats and ensure an adequate dissemination of knowledge to new generations. Companies are migrating to a more digital model based fundamentally on three pillars: communications, big data and artificial intelligence. The right combination of these three pillars will optimise the operation of the electrical system, reducing costs and polluting emissions, accelerating the adoption of non-polluting energies and renewable energies, while maximising economic performance and a closer way of interacting with users. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has been identified as one of the technologies with most potential impact in the next years.},

The main attraction of the concept relies in the fact that it encompasses many scientific topics that were distinct before. The downside is the lack of readability of the current developments about cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). Indeed, the large scientific area of CPPS makes it difficult to identify clearly and rapidly, in the various applications that were made of CPPS, what are the choices, best practices and methodology that are suggested and that could be used for a new application. This work intends to introduce an analysis framework able to classify those developments. An extensive study of literature enabled to extract the major criteria that are to be used in the framework, namely: Development Extent; Research Axis; Instrumenting; Communication standards; Intelligence deposit; Cognition level; Human factor. Several recent examples of CPPS developments in literature are used to illustrate the use of the framework and brief conclusions are drawn from the comparative analysis of those examples.},

Gartner (2016) published an extensive report on the opportunities for digitalization of upstream O&G. The report covered the projected operator impact for drilling and wells, field development, and production and operations. In the report, Exxon Mobil's chief computational scientist is quoted as saying, the “oil patch's digital transformation will be comparable to horizontal drilling's tech revolution (Endress, 2017) (which, of course, was the game-changing technology that enabled the shale gas revolution, among other major industry achievements). Furthermore, the report states that “…he predicts the digitalization of oilfield equipment and operations will continue for the foreseeable future, due to future competitive advantages and untold economic value (Endress, 2017). This final chapter highlights a few of the exciting technologies that are in development or are being envisioned for the digital oil field (DOF) of the future.},

In February 2020, the European Commission published ‘A European Strategy for Data’ (European data strategy: Making the EU a role model for a society empowered by data. European Commission, February 2020. Access on: https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019–2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en (2020)) as part of a wider drive concerning digital transformation and policy. In this article, we analyse the publication as it touches on broader themes ranging from digital literacy, to cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Within this context, in this article, we use the EC publication as a point of departure to explore themes central to national and international digital transformation and policy writ large. As such, this article is to be read as a thematic analysis rather than a close reading of the EC’s publication. The article is divided into three parts: an executive findings and recommendations section (where our main findings are articled); Themes and Key Takeaways (where we thematically flesh out the document); and, EU Data Strategy document summary (where we provide an overview summary the document itself).},

These disruptive technologies are at the center of the fourth industrial revolution, but are we ready yet to educate and prepare new generations to help society, science, and humanity adapt them? How can we change the current curriculum to reflect these technological innovations? How can we help the new generation to develop not only left-brain skills but also right-brain skills? The Netherlands is the second largest food exporter in the world after the United States and the agricultural related exports generated €45 Billion in 2018 for the economy. R&D in Dutch companies and innovation in universities in the Netherlands play an important and active role in this context. In this paper, we provide a general framework for supporting education in the context of Industry 4.0. We adopt the case study of Wageningen University at which we were actively involved in designing and customizing academic courses related to Industry 4.0. Wageningen University, which has the highest rank in the field of Agriculture & Forestry according to influential university rankings and has a rank 59 according to Times Higher Education, is traditionally a life science university but has taken also an active strategy for aligning with the developments in IT and Artificial Intelligence. Apart from the content-wise shift, skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving are addressed by applying project-based evaluations. We discuss the lessons learned and address the issues related to Industry 4.0 and education.},

Cost decrease of sensors, wireless connectivity, and the opportunity to store big amounts of data pushed a process towards a next generation of IT industry. Manufacturing now has the opportunity to gather large quantities of data, coming from different areas, such as product and process design, assembly, material planning, quality control, scheduling, maintenance, fault detection and cover all the product life cycle phases. The extraction of value from data is a new challenge that companies are now experiencing. Therefore, the need for analytical information system is growing, in order to explore datasets and discover useful and often hidden information. Data analytics became a keyword in this context, but sometimes it is not clear how different methods or tools are defined and could be effectively used to analyze data in manufacturing. The paper aims to present and clarify the meaning of terms that are currently and frequently used in the context of analytics. The paper also provides an overview of the data analysis techniques that could be used to extract knowledge from data along the manufacturing process.},

  abstract       = {Coastal lagoons are ecosystems with significant environmental and socio-economic value. However, these natural systems are especially vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanization as a consequence of the tourist development. Despite the vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems, there has been limited development of novel techniques which can provide real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources. Beyond being useful for policy-making procedures at multiple levels of granularity, such tools can increase local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts. This paper introduces the key concept behind the SMARTLAGOON project, which intends to develop a digital twin to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Particularly, we focus on the main research activities carried out since the beginning of the project (January 1st, 2021), which are mainly based on initial mapping and reporting of the main stakeholders' needs and wishes in relation to the technological products to be developed in SMARTLAGOON. This will onset the initial development pathway, while additional stakeholder inputs during the project lifetime will help to further explore and prioritize the key developments, thus maximizing the relevance and impact of the Mar Menor's digital twin.},

  abstract       = {Developments in digital technology and manufacturing processes have expanded the horizon of designer innovation in creating products. In addition to this, real-time collaborative platforms help designers shorten the product development cycle by enabling collaborations with domain experts from concept generation to product realization and after-market. These collaborations are extending beyond enterprise and national boundaries, contributing to a growing concern among designers regarding the security of their sensitive information such as intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets. The source of such sensitive information leaks could be external (e.g., hacker) or internal (e.g., disgruntled employee) to the collaboration. From a designer's perspective, this fear can inhibit participation in a collaboration even though it might result in better products or services. In this paper, we aim to contextualize this evolving security space by discussing various security practices in digital domains, such as encryption and secret sharing, as well as manufacturing domains, such as physically unclonable function (PUF) and physical part watermarking for anticounterfeiting and tamper evidence purposes. Further, we classify these practices with respect to their performance against different adversarial models for different stages in product development. Such a classification can help designers to make informed decisions regarding security practices during the product realization process.},

  abstract       = {In this paper, we present a smart framework for Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled environments that promotes consumer interaction with that smart environment while still providing the control and management functionality necessary to manage the environment. Traditional smart frameworks focus solely upon the control and management functionality, allowing for consumer interaction via a centralized controller only (typically through a website or dedicated application). Traditional frameworks work in small, single manager environments, but are impractical in even medium sized, complex, or distributed multi- manager environments such as smart homes, smart buildings, and smart cities. Our framework is built upon the Liberated Object Location System (LOLS) that provides a distributed, decentralized, secure, and consumer oriented system that merges a control management framework for data collection and analysis with the consumers and the smart elements in the environment. Digital twins, or proxy services, are created for each device. LOLS provides a directory service for each device and its digital twin, allowing consumers to interact with the connected devices in the environment either directly or through the digital twin. Digital twins may exist at multiple levels in the information hierarchy, allowing for localized, regional, or even global functional scope. All digital twins are integrated with the environment control and management functionality, allowing for scalable, distributed smart environments that provide a consumer accessible interface for each smart device.},

  abstract       = {Engineering Education faced few disruptions like Outcome Based Education, Engineering Education for Sustainable Development and the present Industry 4.0 in the recent times. These disruptions failed to change Curricula, Teaching-Learning processes, Assessment appreciably in the large number of engineering institutions in several countries across the world. Same old processes despite switching over to Outcome Based Education or EESD or Industry 4.0 are being continued. Disruption is most sought after in engineering education as it offers lot of advantages like leadership, profit and professional standing. Many Institutions offering engineering programs try to implement disruptions but fail because of lack of understanding about disruption and the associated processes, required finances, Human Resources and more importantly the innovation capabilities. Disruption is a process where a product outsmarts others through Innovation either in Technology or in Product or in processes. Disruption is building a new eco-system to meet the customer’s purpose of buying a product, service or a program. Of late people are trying to implement innovations in Engineering Education with no knowledge of Disruption, its properties and processes. In this paper, we try to take an example of Kingsmen Coffee, a company trying to disrupt in the Indian market, analyse what it is offering and how they are trying to disrupt the existing players and what lessons does it offer to Engineering Educators in Disruption. Kingsmen Coffee is a coffee dispensing machine with new technology and the way it is creating win-win situations for all the stake holders involved, is a matter of interest and study for Engineering Educators. Through this study of Disruption, essential pre-requisites for disruption to happen are noted and they are used to extrapolate for realizing disruption in engineering education. Some suggestions regarding implementation of Disruption are given.},

The DeepQA technology of Watson (a massively parallel probabilistic evidence-based architecture) can effectively deconstruct a question and result in a hypothesis with evidence and confidence scoring. There are key differences between characteristics of AI and cognitive computing even though cognitive computing is considered within the realm of AI. NLP, the machine’s capability to understand language and is the intersection of AI, computer science, and linguistics. NLP consists of natural language understanding and generation and is used in chatbots. Autonomous systems, including robotics, is an AI domain that has a significant role in health care, with surgery and rehabilitation being leading areas. Other key areas of AI technology for health care include robotic process automation, extended reality (augmented, virtual, and mixed reality), blockchain, cloud computing, and internet of things.},

Based on the classic V model for product development, an MBSE double-Vs model is refined which takes both model life-cycle and product life-cycle into consideration for design process re-engineering. Then cloud computing and its re-structuring on traditional industrial software system are discussed. Shift from classic single approach, this research proposes an industrial design and development software system architecture based on model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and cloud computing. The new architecture is shown in a stereoscopic way which amply utilizes the respective advantages of MBSE and cloud computing. At the end of the paper, as an example of actual cases, a flight management system (FMS) design and development platform is detailed to verify the effectiveness of this new architecture. The implement of new system architecture creates an efficient collaborative mechanism for FMS developing.},

  abstract       = {Smart Cities are complex distributed systems which may involve multiple stakeholders, applications, sensors, and IoT devices. In order to be able to link and use such heterogeneous data, spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities can play an important role in establishing interoperability between systems and platforms. Based on the open and international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) concept integrates different sensors, IoT devices, simulation tools, and 3D city models within a common operational framework. However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. Also, there are various users and applications who prefer to work with all the systems in convenient ways using Single-Sign-On. This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration. Such access control and security federation based realization has not been considered in spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities before.},

Germany announced the Industry 4.0 strategy in 2013. The US government launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) in 2011 and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in 2014. Most recently, the Manufacturing USA initiative was officially rolled out to further “leverage existing resources... to nurture manufacturing innovation and accelerate commercialization by fostering close collaboration between industry, academia, and government partners. In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed. Challenges are addressed with applications that are based on commercially available platforms such as General Electric (GE)’s Predix and PTC’s ThingWorx.},

  abstract       = {The development and application of emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 enable the realization of digital twins (DT), which facilitates the transformation of the manufacturing sector to a more agile and intelligent one. DTs are virtual constructs of physical systems that mirror the behavior and dynamics of such physical systems. A fully developed DT consists of physical components, virtual components, and information communications between the two. Integrated DTs are being applied in various processes and product industries. Although the pharmaceutical industry has evolved recently to adopt Quality-by-Design (QbD) initiatives and is undergoing a paradigm shift of digitalization to embrace Industry 4.0, there has not been a full DT application in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Therefore, there is a critical need to examine the progress of the pharmaceutical industry towards implementing DT solutions. The aim of this narrative literature review is to give an overview of the current status of DT development and its application in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. State-of-the-art Process Analytical Technology (PAT) developments, process modeling approaches, and data integration studies are reviewed. Challenges and opportunities for future research in this field are also discussed.},

  abstract       = {Mobile ad hoc network is a network composed of mobile terminals without infrastructure. Due to its fast-networking ability, it is widely used in smart cities, car networking, military, agriculture, medicine, and other fields. Routing technology is a key technology in the field of MANET (mobile ad hoc network). The energy consumption is optimized through the technical network simulator NS-3, and the nodes in the MANET routing protocol can accurately simulate the problem, thereby optimizing the MAC layer of important research tools. This article combines the advantages of the lithium-ion (lithium) battery model. Compared with the KiBaM battery model, the effective charge in the KiBaM model simulates the output voltage well, which can reflect the battery capacity effect rate and the recovery effect of the lithium-ion-KiBaM battery model. The model can respond to the characteristics of the output voltage as the society gets lower and lower. In order to solve the problem that the analytic solution of differential equations cannot be obtained in the model, a numerical solution of the optimization algorithm is proposed based on the implicit Runge–Kutta method. The MAC layer energy consumption and routing protocol optimization algorithm proposed in this paper can be applied well in various fields.},

The parallel data and federated data provide new ideas for addressing these issues. However, how to design the analytics applications of parallel data and federated data is challenging and calls for comprehensive tool support. This paper proposes a federated parallel data platform (FPDP) that provides an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, such as virtual data generation, federation model construction, and parallel data deduction. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype and evaluate the feasibility of the platform design using a fault diagnosis case study. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient to help developing trustworthy AI applications.},

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.},

  abstract       = {In cyber-physical systems, due to the tight integration of the computational, communication, and physical components, most of the information in the cyber-domain manifests in terms of physical actions (such as motion, temperature change, etc.). This leads to the system being prone to physical-to-cyber domain attacks that affect the confidentiality. Physical actions are governed by energy flows, which may be observed. Some of these observable energy flows unintentionally leak information about the cyber-domain and hence are known as the side-channels. Side-channels such as acoustic, thermal, and power allow attackers to acquire the information without actually leveraging the vulnerability of the algorithms implemented in the system. As a case study, we have taken cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems (fused deposition modeling-based three-dimensional (3D) printer) to demonstrate how the acoustic side-channel can be used to breach the confidentiality of the system. In 3D printers, geometry, process, and machine information are the intellectual properties, which are stored in the cyber domain (G-code). We have designed an attack model that consists of digital signal processing, machine-learning algorithms, and context-based post processing to steal the intellectual property in the form of geometry details by reconstructing the G-code and thus the test objects. We have successfully reconstructed various test objects with an average axis prediction accuracy of 86% and an average length prediction error of 11.11%.},

  abstract       = {ESCO is a multilingual classification of Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations created by the European Commission to improve the supply of information on skills demand in the labour market. It is designed to assist individuals, employers, universities and training providers by giving them up to date and standardized information on skills. Rapid technological change means that ESCO needs to be updated in a timely manner. Evidence is presented here of how text-mining techniques can be applied to the analysis of data on emerging skill needs arising from Industry 4.0 to ensure that ESCO provides information which is current. The alignment between ESCO and Industry 4.0 technological trends is analysed. Using text mining techniques, information is extracted on Industry 4.0 technologies from: (i) two versions of ESCO (v1.0 - v1.1.); and (ii) from the 4.0 related scientific literature. These are then compared to identify potential data gaps in ESCO. The findings demonstrate that text mining applied on scientific literature to extract technology trends, can help policy makers to provide more up-to-date labour market intelligence.},

The cloud storage opportunities and possibilities are consistently expanding, wherein multimedia storage occupies the entire stage in the cloud. An essential emphasis on security owing to the nature of multiuser access to cloud credentials in many situations is necessary. The security and safety of data, while in transit, in rest, and while being used by applications, have to be guaranteed through proven technology solutions. Typically, image encryption is the standard way of securing and safeguarding images. The proposed three-layer image encryption scheme uses DNA coding along with chaotic logistic and tent maps for confusion and diffusion operations. Upon verification of user credentials, the storage of encrypted image is accomplished in Amazon S3 web services. The strength of encryption has been evaluated based on the parameters namely brute force attack, statistical, encryption quality, occlusion attack and computational complexity analyses which have proved the suitability of proposed scheme to secure cloud storage of images.},

Business is developed on top of Big Data Analytics and revenue is returned with high percentages from events prediction. Since many business areas can benefit from it, Big Data Analytics as a research topic faces multiple challenges. These ones are: fundamental understanding of models, architectures, security, privacy, but also data science and mentality to accommodate big data-driven decisions. This is argued by a series of facts such as: inference from multiple data sources, observation measuring, missing events and surrogate variables, incomplete information. Thus, this chapter aims to present a broad overview of the most common methods and techniques, including processing data platforms, used for analytics applied to large volume of unstructured, semistructured, and structured data coming with high velocity. Moreover, the tutorial character of this material helps to develop some capabilities in analyzing small data, to be followed up with massive amounts of data.},

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.},

However, there is a growing concern among users regarding the security risks associated with CPS. Especially with rising number of cyber-attacks on CPS, such as modifying sensor readings, interrupting operations, etc. Therefore, this paper describes a security surveillance framework to detect deviations in the ecosystem by incorporating a digital twin supported anomaly detection model. The reason for incorporating digital twins is that they add value by enabling real-time monitoring of connected smart farms. We pre-process the collected data from sensors deployed on the smart farm setup. The pre-processed data is fused with our smart farm ontology to populate a knowledge graph. The generated graph is further queried to extract the necessary sensor data. We utilize the extracted normal data to train the anomaly detection model. Further, we tested our model if it identifies abnormal values from sensors by simulating anomalous use case scenarios specific to our ecosystem.},

The proposed platform aims at being among the first solutions capable of empowering industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs), providing an environment that streamlines the management of digital twins along the whole plant life cycle. The platform features a distributed architecture based on microservices and big data best practices; it supports the definition of CPS digital representations and the handling of data conveyed from the shop floor for real-to-digital synchronization.},

In this context, understanding and modelling the role of humans turns out to be crucial to develop efficient manufacturing systems of the future. Grounding on previous researches in the field of Human-in-the-Loop and Human Cyber-Physical Systems, the paper aims at contributing to a deep reflection about human-machine interaction in the wider perspective of Social Human-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical Production Systems, in which more agents collaborate and are socially connected. After presenting an evolution of manufacturing control organisations, an architecture to depict social interactions in smart factories is proposed. The proposed architecture contributes to the representation of different human roles in the smart factory and the exploration of both hierarchical and heterarchical data-driven decision-making processes in manufacturing.},

Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.},

  abstract       = {With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals.Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that.In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.},

In addition, information sharing becomes increasingly decisive for the competition, e.g. in supply networks where products and logistics data such as demands and capacities are exchanged. As many companies are, however, highly reluctant to share data across the supply chain, this paper applies the methodology of design science research to, first, state the requirements for shared digital twins based on five industrial use cases. It turns out that with regard to data decentralism, sovereignty and compatibility through global standardization are key success factors. Hence, second, this paper presents a concept for a shared digital twin providing data on demand, i.e. at the right time and in particular with data condensed to the concrete need, thus, minimizing volume. The concept covers both the company-internal and the supply network perspective.},

Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.},

  abstract       = {The 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0, I4.0) is based upon the penetration of many new technologies to the industrial world. These technologies are posed to fundamentally change assembly lines around the world. Assembly systems transformed by I4.0 technology integration are referred to here as Assembly 4.0 (A4.0). While most I4.0 new technologies are known, and their integration into shop floors is ongoing or imminent, there is a gap between this knowledge and understanding the form and the impact of their full implementation in assembly systems. The path from the new technological abilities to improved productivity and profitability has not been well understood and has some missing parts. This paper strives to close a significant part of this gap by creating a road map to understand and explore the impact of typical I4.0 new technologies on A4.0 systems. In particular, the paper explores three impact levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. On the strategic level, we explore aspects related to the design of the product, process, and the assembly system. Additionally, the paper elaborates on likely changes in assembly design aspects, due to the flexibility and capabilities that these new technologies will bring. Strategic design also deals with planning and realizing the potential of interactions between sub-assembly lines, kitting lines, and the main assembly lines. On the tactical level, we explore the impact of policies and methodologies in planning assembly lines. Finally, on the operational level, we explore how these new capabilities may affect part routing and scheduling including cases of disruptions and machine failures. We qualitatively assess the impact on performance in terms of overall flow time and ability to handle a wide variety of end products. We point out the cases where clear performance improvement is expected due to the integration of the new technologies. We conclude by identifying research opportunities and challenges for advanced assembly systems.},

  year  = {2020},

  volume         = {123},
  abstract       = {The development of dynamic data-based Decision Support Systems (DSSs) along with the increasing availability of data in the industry, makes real-time data acquisition and management a challenge. Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database. This paper presents an implementation of the platform in the pharmaceutical industry, providing interoperability and real-time reaction capability to changes to an industrial prototype using dynamic scheduling algorithms.},

  year  = {2021},
  pages = {107534},
  volume         = {160},
  abstract       = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasingly more complex and integrated into our everyday lives forming the basis of smart infrastructures, products, and services. Consequently, there is a greater need for their ability to perform their required functions under expected and unexpected adverse events. Moreover, the multitude of threats and their rapid evolution pushes the development of approaches that go beyond pure technical reliability, rather encompassing multi-dimensional performance of a socio-technical system. These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.},

  abstract       = {The impact of barriers and incentives on the relationship between openness to Industry 4.0 and performance have so far received little scholarly attention. As a result, this paper explores this relationship by employing a mixed methods approach. A qualitative analysis using in-depth interviews and multiple case studies identifies prominent barriers and incentives, whilst a quantitative analysis on a representative sample of 500 local manufacturing units in Piedmont (a region of Northern Italy) is undertaken via an OLS regression-based path analysis. The results of the parallel-serial multiple mediation model show that: (1) greater openness to Industry 4.0 is related to better performance; (2) greater openness to Industry 4.0 leads to a higher perception of barriers; (3) greater knowledge-related and economic and financial barriers improve performance, abstracting from the adoption of incentives; and (4) greater openness to Industry 4.0 drives the adoption of incentives. However, perceived economic and financial barriers are found not to drive firms to adopt more incentives. The study contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying previously unidentified strengths and weaknesses to barriers and incentives, and highlights the necessity of policies that reflect real firms’ needs.},

  abstract       = {Advanced manufacturing is one of the core national strategies in the US (AMP), Germany (Industry 4.0) and China (Made-in China 2025). The emergence of the concept of Cyber Physical System (CPS) and big data imperatively enable manufacturing to become smarter and more competitive among nations. Many researchers have proposed new solutions with big data enabling tools for manufacturing applications in three directions: product, production and business. Big data has been a fast-changing research area with many new opportunities for applications in manufacturing. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of big data in manufacturing. Six key drivers of big data applications in manufacturing have been identified. The key drivers are system integration, data, prediction, sustainability, resource sharing and hardware. Based on the requirements of manufacturing, nine essential components of big data ecosystem are captured. They are data ingestion, storage, computing, analytics, visualization, management, workflow, infrastructure and security. Several research domains are identified that are driven by available capabilities of big data ecosystem. Five future directions of big data applications in manufacturing are presented from modelling and simulation to real-time big data analytics and cybersecurity.},

  abstract       = {The many scholars approaching Industry 4.0 today need to confront the lack of an agreed-upon definition, posing serious limitations to theory building and research comparability. Since its initial German conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the Industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms − such as “smart manufacturing, “digital transformation, and “fourth industrial revolution − have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts. The review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. Each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. This categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets.},

Digital economy has become the direction of all countries in guaranteeing their steady economic growth and rebuilding their competitive strength as well as one of the cooperative areas of international community. (1) In major countries, digital economy is developing fast, with its speed higher than that of GDP. In 2016, the global digital economic scale accounted for over one fourth of the global total GDP. (2) China and the United States are the “twin stars in the field of digital economy. The latter ranks first in the scale of digital economy while the former is the largest e-commerce market of the world, with its e-business transaction volume accounting for 40% of the world’s total. (3) Platform economies have new ecosystems of digital economy. Global Internet businesses have adopted the platform development mode. So far, the top 10 Internet businesses in market value have surpassed the top 10 traditional multinationals and become the leading force in the global digital economy development. (4) Digital economy has become the “wind gap of global entrepreneurship and innovation, attracting a large proportion of technologies, capital and talents of the world. (5) Digital economy is ushering in a new round of globalization. In the global service trade, digital trade accounts for an increasing percentage. It is expected that the transaction volume of global cross-border B2C business will reach US$994 billion by 2020. (6) Intelligent manufacturing has become the major direction of global manufacturing and will bring about revolutionary changes in traditional industrial manufacturing. (7) China’s sharing economy has become the biggest highlight of the world. In 2016, the transaction volume amounted to RMB3.45 trillion yuan, with a year-on-year growth of 103%.

  abstract       = {The maritime industry is one of the most polluting in the world. In this paper we present fresh insights related to the application of the novel blockchain technology in reducing pollutions. We analyse recent literature on blockchain technology and propose ways of the utilization of blockchain technology in the maritime industry. Special interest for maritime industry specialists represents the perspectives of the utilization of the blockchain technology in improving the environmental efficiency of the maritime industry. The technology has a broad range of applicability, allowing connecting the supply chain more efficiently, providing the exchange and visibility of time-stamped proofed data, decreasing the industry operational costs with intermediaries and increasing security. It also allows full visibility for all parties involved with proof of work, facilitating Class Societies inspections, Port State Control and audits compliance. The results of the study also show that cases on blockchain application in other fields increase the industry willingness to its application on the maritime industry. While having blockchain implementation specialized third parties would increase the implementation possibility and the industry willingness due to reduced costs and friction. The study will be interesting for scholars, policy-makers and practitioners from the maritime industry.},

Industry 4.0 will transform entire production systems and products. However, the subject still lacks systematic study in its state of the art. This study seeks to identify relations or associations among emerging technologies in Industry 4.0. Through publications on its theme and keywords, a data mining technique was applied to help identify the network of associations with a new bibliometric approach. In order to reach the objective of the study, we utilized the Apriori algorithm in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software. In this process, 15 association rules were found that met the input metrics: support, confidence, and lift. The rules point to two main technologies, internet of things and cyber-physical systems. This research points out that these technologies are key elements of Industry 4.0, and are related to others, such as cloud, big data, automation, virtualization, and robotics. Through data mining, the best associations and relations of the technologies in Industry 4.0 were identified. Moreover, this study pointed out the most important technologies for the new industrial revolution and the complementary technologies of each identified group. Thus, this network of technologies provides a basic guide for future works, which seek to deepen the characteristics of these relations.},

Capitalism in the financial sense plays a fundamental role. This chapter discusses the first, second, third, and fourth industrial revolutions. The fourth industrial revolution originates from the increased power of computers that follow Moore's law stipulating that their power doubles every 18 months. Artificial intelligence (AI) is based on machine learning, which itself includes deep learning. Deep learning utilizes algorithms called artificial neural networks. The transition to digital technology and AI has brought in its wake a number of digital tools and methods that have changed the landscape of the company and its means of production. The digital twin makes it possible to move from curative and preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance.},

  abstract       = {Digital twins refer to virtual replicas of physical objects that, inter alia, enable to monitor, visualize, and predict states of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). These capabilities yield efficiency gains and quality improvements in manufacturing processes. In addition, the concept of digital twins can also be leveraged to advance the security of the smart factory. More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs. However, efficiently creating, maintaining, and running digital twins still represents a major research challenge, as the overhead costs hinder the adoption of this concept. We believe that these insights are valuable to shape future research in this emerging research area at the intersection of digital twins and information security.},

In the meantime, the increasing penetration of an array of information technologies and controllable devices together suggests that the communications networks enact critical roles in the electric power infrastructure. Indeed, reconfiguration of the current structure of the multi-carrier energy networks by incorporating the advanced communication protocols is one of the essential steps in the grid modernization process. Therefore, this chapter is developed to introduce the required communication systems for modernizing future energy networks. In this regard, the key role of the communication platforms in coordinating the grid agents is examined considering the effective participation of the various control centers and intelligent devices throughout the modern grid. Also, this chapter investigates how to implement some effective technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) in the modern energy grid by adopting capable technologies such as the Internet of Energy while satisfying the modern energy networks’ standards.},

  abstract       = {The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.},

Optimal reactive power control of DERs can be used to mitigate distribution system voltage violations caused by increased penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this work, a new technology called the Programmable Distribution Resource Open Management Optimization System (ProDROMOS) issued optimized DER reactive power setpoints based-on results from a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm wrapped around OpenDSS time-series feeder simulations. This paper demonstrates the use of the ProDROMOS in a RT simulated environment using a power hardware-in-the-loop PV inverter and in a field demonstration, using a 678 kW PV system in Grafton (MA, USA). The primary contribution of the work is demonstrating a RT digital twin effectively provides state estimation pseudo-measurements that can be used to optimize DER operations for distribution voltage regulation.},

Virtual laboratories are described as an example of using digital twins not only in industry but also for educational purposes. The article is also focused on the value of physical and virtual investigations through the prism of content and language integrated learning approach (CLIL) and it offers recommendations for combining the two to strengthen science inquiry learning and job-relevant learning. Students conduct online investigations resulting in interdisciplinary team interaction and knowledge integration. Adopting the CLIL approach changes engineering students’ attitudes to learning a foreign language, drums up their academic interest, and strengthens their motivation. In addition, the article describes how neural networks are applied for the simulation of physical processes in a virtual laboratory. The advantages of using virtual laboratories for professional-oriented training include linking observable and unobservable phenomena, pointing out essential information, and providing online, adaptive guidance. To evaluate the efficiency of the virtual laboratory environment, we conducted an experiment to assess the effectiveness of an integrated learning course with the elements of a virtual laboratory. The sample was 48 students (23 of them were enrolled on the course based on integrated learning with elements of virtual environment; 25 students studied professional discipline and professional English separately). To collect the data two online testing on English were conducted. The professional discipline was evaluated once at the end of the semester. In addition, we conducted an online survey on motivation for students of both groups to reveal the influence of educational process organization on this indicator. The results of the experiment allowed us to ascertain that the CLIL approach in the virtual laboratory environment resulted in better outcomes and helped the students adopt a more positive attitude to learning English.},

The reader may ponder about the amorphous questions or wonder in confusion. We disrupt the status quo and indulge in orthogonal, nonlinear, and asymmetric information arbitrage which may not be correct. This is a seed, sterile unless cultivated. We aspire to inform that tools and data related to the affluent world are not a template to be “copied or applied to systems in the remaining (80%) parts of the world which suffer from economic constraints. We need different thinking that resists the inclination of the affluent 20% of the world to treat the rest of the world (80% of the population) as a market. The 80/20 concept evokes the Pareto [1] theme in P3 and the implication is that ideas may float between (porous) the 80/20 domains (partition).},

Significantly increased energy, material and workforce productivity and improved environment sustainability are pathways to opportunities as well as outcomes of enterprise optimization. This paper returns smart manufacturing (SM) as a term of “practice to its roots, revisiting it as a forward looking term about next-generation operations technology (OT) and information technology (IT) integration based on the manufacturing objectives that originally defined it. Building meaning through a lens of practices that orchestrate capabilities to achieve business and operational objectives makes it possible to describe SM itself as set of practices that distinguish it from today’s 40-year history of applying IT to manufacturing. Key practices at SM’s core are centered on: business and technology; seams and an OT/IT journey; OT/IT enterprise workflow modeling; cyberinfrastructure and reference architecture; and workforce, innovation, and marketplace.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 was introduced with the hope of transitioning to the next industrial revolution. I4.0 is a vision of increasing flexibility and efficiency within a system of low complexity. Despite this intention, Industry 4.0 has required users to understand complex information and communication systems, limiting usability and therefore not necessarily satisfying the original vision. However, application of principles from the Lean Production Systems originally developed in the 1930’s in combination with Industry 4.0, may help to reach its desired goals. Through a literature review, this paper discusses the current state of art of Industry 4.0 and some Lean Production Systems principles. The paper focuses on a model combining Lean Production Systems with Industry 4.0, that was created in response to the shortcomings of the anticipated industrial revolution. With a Lean Production System as a foundation, the six design principles of I4.0 of interoperability, virtualization, decentralization, real-time capability, service orientation, and modularity can be better implemented to reach the vision of highly flexible and low complexity systems. In return, horizontal and vertical integration within Industry 4.0 can support and accelerate Lean principles by reducing human error and increasing intercommunications between the systems, resulting in a productive integration. The specific principles of Lean that could boost Industry 4.0 will be discussed, demonstrating why a company should be Lean, meaning value adding processes and stakeholder orientation are at its core.},

An interesting perspective for the development of security solutions is the use of an event management approach, knowing that an event may become an incident when an information asset is affected under certain circumstances. The paper at hand proposes a security solution based on the management of security events within IoT scenarios in order to accurately identify suspicious activities. To this end, different vulnerabilities found in IoT devices are described, as well as unique features that make these devices an appealing target for attacks. Finally, three IoT attack scenarios are presented, describing exploited vulnerabilities, security events generated by the attack, and accurate responses that could be launched to help decreasing the impact of the attack on IoT devices. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach is suitable for protecting the IoT ecosystem, giving an adequate protection level to the IoT devices.},

  abstract       = {As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?},

Each refinement process leaves a proof trail, checkable by the normal Coq kernel, justifying its soundness. We focus on the synthesis of abstract data types that package methods with private data. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to the synthesis of query structures -- abstract data types with SQL-like query and insert operations. Fiat includes a library for writing specifications of query structures in SQL-inspired notation, expressing operations over relations (tables) in terms of mathematical sets. This library includes a suite of tactics for automating the refinement of specifications into efficient, correct-by-construction OCaml code. Using these tactics, a programmer can generate such an implementation completely automatically by only specifying the equivalent of SQL indexes, data structures capturing useful views of the abstract data. Throughout we speculate on the new programming modularity possibilities enabled by an automated refinement system with proved-correct rules.},

  volume         = {49},
  abstract       = {The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT’s structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.},

MoC is a process for evaluating and controlling modifications to facility design, operation, organization, or activities—prior to implementation—to be sure no new hazards are introduced. Traditionally, MoC is related to technical changes. Safety implications from organizational changes have recently led to proposed integrated management of both types. An inadequate MoC is recognized as a recurring cause of accidents, often resulting in major accidents, mainly in the process industry. Despite this recognised criticality, the MoC workflow in many companies is still far from being mature and there are still evident shortcomings in its application that have to be compensated. The technical solutions composed by the enabling technologies within Industry 4.0 can offer a valid support to overcome the MoC shortcomings, as will be discussed within this chapter.},

  abstract       = {Background: The digital transformation is an increasingly popular research topic. Unfortunately, it lacks a common and sustainable theoretical fundament. Further, it is unclear which role the characteristics of the affected industries, firms and markets play regarding the impact that the digital transformation has on them.

Method: Taking up these two challenges in a combined fashion for one of the economically most important, but also most specialized and physical global industries, we systematically review the latest literature on the digital transformation within the manufacturing context.

Results: This work is the first one that provides a valid theoretical basis on the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry. Thereby, it becomes clear that this basis is severely depending on its context. In particular, we show that the manufacturing industry is special in several dimensions, mainly due to its high physicality. Many of the connected technological concepts and domains are solely applicable within that particular environment. Also, our results indicate that a notable share of manufacturing firms did not experience any or at least not big impacts by the digital transformation on the business model level but indeed heavy impacts on the process level until now. However, for our initial suspicion that the structural differences between the manufac-turing industry and other more hardware-independent industries are so far reaching as that they would even lead to definitional differences, no evidence was found.

Conclusions: This study contributes to the ongoing line of activities trying to streamline the extensive research around the digital transformation and thereby especially emphasizes the importance of context in that area of research.},

  abstract       = {Abstract The Industry 4.0 concept corresponds to a new way of organizing the means of production. It refers to the generation of connected, robotized, and intelligent factories. With the digital revolution, the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are shrinking to merge with new interactive modes between operators, machines, and products. Artificial intelligence, 3D printing, virtual reality, digital twin, blockchain, robotics, and digital technologies are transforming the means of production, organization, and business models of companies. If it is a more competitive technological revolution, bearer of numerous innovations, and creator of a new market dynamic, of possible reintegration of manufacturing in Western countries, Industry 4.0 disrupts the world of work as a whole. Indeed, it is the whole system of decision and political regulation of companies, communities, and states (and their natures) of the work relations on the part of the operators which is questioned with an obligation to get out of the processes of individualization and social misanthropy which are taking place at the moment. Transitions are therefore taking place with the search for a possible combination of classical aspects with the immense potential of digital technologies.},

Numerous challenges arise while creating a smart city. Digital twins, along with the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless systems, blockchain, collaborative computing, simulation, and artificial intelligence technologies, offer great potential in the transformation of the current urban governance paradigm toward smart cities. In this paper, the concept of a digital twin city (DTC) is proposed. The characteristics, key technologies, and application scenarios of a DTC are elaborated upon. Further, we discuss the theories, research directions, and framework regarding DTCs.},

Over-connectivity and data management abilities targeted by Industry 4.0 paradigm enable the emergence of more flexible and reactive control systems, based on the cooperation of autonomous and connected entities in the decision-making process. From most relevant articles extracted from existing literature, a list of 10 key enablers for Industry 4.0 is first presented. During the last 20 years, the holonic paradigm has become a major paradigm of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems. After the presentation of the holonic paradigm and holon properties, this article highlights how historical and current holonic control architectures can partly fulfil Industry 4.0 key enablers. The remaining unfulfilled key enablers are then the subject of an extensive discussion on the remaining research perspectives on holonic architectures needed to achieve a complete support of Industry 4.0.},

These systems depend on the correct operation of sensors, actuators, and third-party services, and the failure of a single one can hinder the proper functioning of the whole system, making error detection and recovery of paramount importance, but often overlooked. By drawing inspiration from other research areas, such as cloud, embedded, and mission-critical systems, we present a set of patterns for self-healing IoT systems. We discuss how their implementation can improve system reliability by providing error detection, error recovery, and health mechanisms maintenance.},

  abstract    = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

  abstract       = {The so-called “smartization of manufacturing industries has been conceived as the fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0, a paradigm shift propelled by the upsurge and progressive maturity of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) applied to industrial processes and products. From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.},

  abstract       = {Our proposal aims to help solving a trust problem between licensors and licensees that occurs during the active life of license agreements. We particularly focus on licensing of proprietary intellectual property (IP) that is embedded in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services (e.g. patented technologies). To achieve this we propose to encode the logic of license agreements into smart licenses (SL). We define a SL as a `digital twin' of a licensing contract, i.e. one or more smart contracts that represent the full or relevant parts of a licensing agreement in machine readable and executable code. As SL are self enforcing, the royalty computation and execution of payments can be fully automated in a tamper free and trustworthy way. This of course, requires to employ a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Such an Automated Licensing Payment System (ALPS) can thus automate an established business process and solve a longstanding trust issue in licensing markets. It renders traditional costly audits obsolete, lowers entry barriers for those who want to participate in licensing markets, and enables novel business models too complex with traditional approaches.},

  abstract       = {As a new area of technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a flagship and promising paradigm for innovating society. However, IoT-based critical infrastructures are an appealing target for cybercriminals. Such distinctive infrastructures are increasingly sensitive to cyber vulnerabilities and subject to many cyberattacks. Thus, protecting these infrastructures is a significant issue for organizations and nations. In this context, raising the cybersecurity posture of critical cyber infrastructures is an extremely urgent international issue. In addition, with the rapid development of adversarial techniques, current cyber threats have become more sophisticated, complicated, advanced and persistent. Thus, given these factors, prior to implementing efficient and resilient cybersecurity countermeasures, identification and in-depth mapping of cyber threats is an important step that is generally overlooked. Therefore, to solve cybersecurity challenges, this study presents a critical analysis of the most recent cybersecurity issues for IoT-based critical infrastructures. We then discuss potential cyber threats and cyber vulnerabilities and the main exploitation strategies adopted by cybercriminals. Further, we provide a taxonomy of cyberattacks that may affect critical cyber infrastructures. Finally, we present security requirements and some realistic recommendations to enhance cybersecurity solutions.},

Examples are modern road vehicles (assisted and autonomous driving), CPS road networks (car2x), power plants, smart grids and healthcare devices. However, due to the dynamic interconnection and the largely unpredictable number of possible system configurations the dependable cooperation of CPS can not be fully assured at design time. The malfunction of a CPS could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an early excerpt of an ongoing holistic approach and toolchain architecture that supports the design, development, implementation, operation and maintenance of dependable CPS. The proposed approach uses the dependability information accumulated during the system specification process as an input configuration for self-adaptive systems. These self-adaptive systems then test and assure the dependability properties of the CPS throughout the whole system life cycle.},

However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4]. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method. The envisioned method is supposed to be a holistic approach that supports the efficient cross-domain design, development, implementation and maintenance of dependable CPSs, where security and safety are a critical aspect that requires an in-depth risk assessment.},

  abstract       = {The industrial paradigm of a Digital Twin (DT), a virtual representation of a physical object, promises an impactful opportunity to advance digital healthcare. Especially in telemedicine, the application of DTs could yield various benefits for patients, providers, and payers. However, the development of DTs for healthcare and specifically telemedicine is not yet mature. Therefore, this research in progress paper attempts to structure the research field and classify DTs for digital health and in future, for telemedicine. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR) and grounded theory analysis techniques, we derive 12 dimensions and 35 characteristics that support researchers and practitioners to develop, apply, refine and evaluate various DT applications. The taxonomy serves as a promising starting point for further research on implementing or adopting DTs in healthcare and telemedicine. An application of a real-world objective already shows the feasibility of our taxonomy.},

However, since the use of autonomous systems is still relatively new, there are still a lot of challenges associated with trusting these systems. Without operators in direct control of all actions, there are significant concerns associated with endangering human lives or damaging equipment. For this reason, NATO has issued a challenge seeking to identify ways to improve decision-maker and operator trust when deploying autonomous systems, and de-risk their adoption. This paper presents the proposal of the winning solution to this NATO challenge. It approaches trust as a multi-dimensional concept, by incorporating the four dimensions of human-agent trust establishment in a digital twin context.},

While real-time data collection and information analytics become easier in indoor wayfinding, a new challenge has arisen: cognitive overload due to information redundancy. Standardized and universal spatial information systems are still widely used in emergency wayfinding, ignoring first responders’ individual difference in information intake. This paper proposes and tests the theoretical framework of a spatial information systems for first responders, which reflects their individual difference in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in line of duty. The proposed method includes the use of Virtual Reality (VR) experiments to simulate real world buildings, and the modeling of first responders’ reactions to different information formats and contents in simulated wayfinding tasks. This work is expected to set a foundation of future spatial information system that correctly and effectively responds to first responders’ needs.},

At the same time, the energy generation gradually reshapes into decentralised network with lower capacity, but able to manage demand and supply in real-time. However, the penetration of online platforms within the energy sector poses policy questions that are specific to platforms' business models. This study investigates a sample of 217 digital platforms running energy-related activities across the EU regional markets. These energy platforms make about 20% of the world energy platforms. By observing their characteristics and those of their surrounding markets, it appears that the digital platforms in the European energy sector still tend to be relatively small and concentrated in specific regions, often in the neighbourhood of capital cities. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis suggests that market size, digital readiness and regulatory quality are the most important features relating to platforms' presence in the EU regional markets. This paper offers empirical evidence and reflections to provide energy policy with key information to best ripe the potential of new technologies while being aware of their inherited complexities.},

The creation, protection, exchange, valorization, enrichment and monetization of intangible assets all come up against obstacles in the form of three categories of systemic asymmetries: trust and security asymmetries, information and control asymmetries, and revenue and recognition asymmetries. The original Bitcoin protocol, called proof of work, aims to prevent malicious people from attacking the Bitcoin network by forcing them to use their computing power to prove their contributions to the network. Private protocols, such as proof of authority, are more “human centered and can achieve a much lower carbon footprint. The augmentation convergence of the Bio, Phy and Digital worlds is based on the AugmentChain propelled by three “pyramidal engines, the enablers, the catalysts and the outcome that work together in short cycles.},

It is centered on the non-visible part (for end-users) of digital services used on a day-to-day basis. The main purpose of edge computing is to describe an area as the technical landscape “over the Internet. Edge computing extends the ability of devices to work in disconnected situations or deliver services without being fully dependent on online resources. It a key driver for the Internet of Augmented Me (I.AM). The chapter illustrates some characteristics of business cases in order to explain how to look at these business cases from an edge computing point of view. Edge computing contributes to end-to-end solutions, and transforms the I.AM into a responsive, personalized and omnipresent service. Edge computing is an essential component in the user experience, fully seamless through all the “smart everything technologies and the collaborative models.},

Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly, researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate friendly society.},

  abstract       = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.},

  abstract       = {Technological change has been a constant feature of livestock systems leading to the third agricultural ‘green’ revolution of the mid-20th century. Digital technologies are now leading us into the fourth agricultural revolution, where sustainable food production is supported by technologies that collect data useful for farm and supply chain performance improvement, along with task automation and compliance. However, the potential benefits of digital agricultural futures are uncertain and plagued by unrealized expectations of previous innovations. The aims of this paper are to articulate current trends in technology and livestock systems and anticipate future trajectories for Agriculture 4.0 in relation to meeting sustainability and animal welfare outcomes for livestock systems. We use a ‘Futures Triangle’ approach to review the role of technology in livestock systems. The main findings are that previous work envisioning technological livestock futures have favoured pull of the future factors (techno-optimists) or weight of the past (techno-pessimists), rather than a balance of pull, push and weighting factors. Responsible Agriculture 4.0 innovation requires public–private collaboration of innovation system stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, consumers, as well as technology developers, to enable development of transition pathways from a systems perspective. The use of responsible innovation processes, including anticipation on alternative futures, should also be built into innovation processes to support critical reflection on technological trajectories and related innovation system consequences, both desirable and undesirable.},

Strengthening the security aspects of IoT devices prior to their use in different systems can contribute to minimize the attack surface. This study aimed to model a sequence of seven steps to minimize the attack surface by executing hardening processes. Conducted a systematic literature review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) techniques. In this way, we were able to define a proposed methodology to evaluate the security level of an IoT solution by means of a checklist that considers the security aspects in the three layers of the IoT architecture. A risk matrix adapted to IoT is established to evaluate the attack surface. Finally, a process of hardening and vulnerability analysis is proposed to reduce the attack surface and improve the security level of the IoT solution.},

We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.},

While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.},

These capabilities yield efficiency gains and quality improvements in manufacturing processes. In addition, the concept of digital twins can also be leveraged to advance the security of the smart factory. More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs. However, efficiently creating, maintaining, and running digital twins still represents a major research challenge, as the overhead costs hinder the adoption of this concept. We believe that these insights are valuable to shape future research in this emerging research area at the intersection of digital twins and information security.},

However, in practice, the adoption of smart contract-based automation is in its infancy, raising the question if the technology genuinely offers a unique approach to process automation. Drawing on an exploratory case study of four start-ups, we investigate the potentials for automation that organizations achieve through smart contracts and how smart contracts differ from established automation technologies, such as workflow management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and robotic process automation. We contribute to the literature on process automation by unveiling transparent and immutable, cross-organizational, and decentralized automation as characteristics that differentiate smart contracts from established automation technologies. Besides, we provide practitioners with an understanding of application scenarios, potentials, and drawbacks of smart contracts for process automation.},

Thus, Supply chains employing and fabricating semiconductors become the core driver and beneficent of digitalization. In order to exploit digitalization potentials, Semantic Web technologies are used to create a digital twin for semiconductor supply chains and supply chains containing semiconductors.

Due to the digitalization, interconnection, and constantly increasing complexity of manufacturing systems in the context of Industrie 4.0, the manual effort necessary to achieve the required safety and security is becoming ever greater and almost impossible to manage, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, this paper examines the existing challenges in this area in more detail and gives an outlook on the possible solutions to ensure safety and security much quicker and with less manual effort. The overall vision is a (partially) automated risk assessment of modular systems with respect to safety and security, including the alignment of the corresponding processes from both domains and the formalization of the information models needed. ,  Zusammenfassung Um Safety und Security von industriellen Systemen im Hinblick auf alle Lebenszyklusphasen von der Entwicklung über den Betrieb bis zur Entsorgung zu gewährleisten, werden bestimmte regulatorische und normative Anforderungen gestellt. Durch die Digitalisierung, Vernetzung und stetig steigende Komplexität von Fertigungssystemen im Kontext von Industrie 4.0 wird der manuelle Aufwand zur Sicherstellung der geforderten Safety und Security immer größer und vor allem für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen kaum noch bewältigbar. Daher untersucht dieser Artikel die bestehenden Probleme in diesem Bereich genauer und gibt einen Ausblick auf die möglichen Lösungen, um Safety und Security deutlich schneller und mit weniger manuellem Aufwand zu gewährleisten. Ziel ist eine (teil-) automatisierte Risikobeurteilung von modularen Systemen in Bezug auf Safety und Security, einschließlich des Abgleichs der entsprechenden Prozesse aus beiden Domänen und der Formalisierung der benötigten Informationsmodelle.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Complex processes meet and need Industry 4.0 capabilities. Shorter product cycles, flexible production needs, and direct assessment of product quality attributes and raw material attributes call for an increased need of new process analytical technologies (PAT) concepts. While individual PAT tools may be available since decades, we need holistic concepts to fulfill above industrial needs. In this series of two contributions, we want to present a combined view on the future of PAT (process analytical technology), which is projected in smart labs (Part 1) and smart sensors (Part 2). Part 2 of this feature article series describes the future functionality as well as the ingredients of a smart sensor aiming to eventually fuel full PAT functionality. The smart sensor consists of (i) chemical and process information in the physical twin by smart field devices, by measuring multiple components, and is fully connected in the IIoT 4.0 environment. In addition, (ii) it includes process intelligence in the digital twin, as to being able to generate knowledge from multi-sensor and multi-dimensional data. The cyber-physical system (CPS) combines both elements mentioned above and allows the smart sensor to be self-calibrating and self-optimizing. It maintains its operation autonomously. Furthermore, it allows—as central PAT enabler—a flexible but also target-oriented predictive control strategy and efficient process development and can compensate variations of the process and raw material attributes. Future cyber-physical production systems—like smart sensors—consist of the fusion of two main pillars, the physical and the digital twins. We discuss the individual elements of both pillars, such as connectivity, and chemical analytics on the one hand as well as hybrid models and knowledge workflows on the other. Finally, we discuss its integration needs in a CPS in order to allow its versatile deployment in efficient process development and advanced optimum predictive process control.},

Therefore, the aggregated and contextualized data is bundled in a central data hub, bringing tremendous cybersecurity advantages. Given the threat landscape in IIoT systems, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to be prepared regarding their cybersecurity, react quickly, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity. For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures. Thus, this paper conceptualizes a flexible security analytics service that implements security capabilities with flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs' needs. The security analytics service is also evaluated with a real-world use case.},

In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the integration of data and analytics as an analytical unit into the field of Service Innovation – referred to as Data-Driven Service Innovation (DDSI). Overall, the SLR reveals three main research perspectives that span the research field of Data-Driven Service Innovation: Explorative DDSI, validative DDSI, and generative DDSI. This integrated theoretical framework describes the distinct operant roles of data analytics for Service Innovation, and thus contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of DDSI by providing three unified lenses, which researchers can use to describe and locate their existing and future research endeavors in this ample field. Building up on the insights from the SLR, a research agenda is proposed in order to trigger and guide further discussions and future research surrounding DDSI. Ultimately, this paper aims at contributing to the body of knowledge of Service Innovation in general and Data-Driven Service Innovation in particular by presenting a three-dimensional research space model structuring DDSI towards its advancement.},

An often neglected aspect of the product life-cycle management is the confidentiality of transactions to hide valuable business information from competitors. To solve the combined problem of trust and confidentiality, we present a confidential licensing and tracking system which works on any publicly verifiable, token-based blockchain that supports tokens of different types representing licenses or attributes of parts. Together with the secure integration of a unique eID in each part, our system provides an efficient, immutable and authenticated transaction log scalable to thousands of transactions per second. With our confidential Token-Based License Management system (cTLM), large industries such as automotive or aviation can license and trace all parts confidentially.},

The Guiding Opinions puts forward “three-step goals by 2025, 2035 and the mid-twenty-first century and proposes to establish three systems—network, platform and security systems, advance two applications, i.e., integrated innovation by large enterprises and application and popularization among SMEs, and build three pillars—industrial, ecological and international—and seven tasks. Since 2018, in order to further ensure that all work is carried out effectively, turn the strategy into plans and plans into actions, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and other 22 ministries and commissions jointly developed the Action Plan for the Development of the Industrial Internet (2018–2020) in June 2018, to ensure the completion of the targets and tasks in the first stage, i.e., 2018–2020, set forth in the Guiding Opinions. Recently, guidance documents such as the Implementation Plan for the Cultivation of Industrial Internet APPs (2018–2020), the Guidelines for the Construction and Promotion of Industrial Internet Platforms, the Evaluation Methods of Industrial Internet Platforms and the Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Industrial Internet Security have been or will be introduced in succession, and specific measures have been gradually detailed, indicating that China has basically established the policy system of “top-level programme + action plan + implementation guides for the Industrial Internet [24–26].},

Advances in technology within industry 4.0 can provide acquisition of large amounts of data, to support decision making in manufacturing. Those possibilities have brought anew attention to the applicability of discrete event simulation for production flow modelling when moving towards design of logistics systems 4.0. This paper reports a study investigating challenges and opportunities for initiation of discrete event simulation, as a tool for decision making in the era of industry 4.0 manufacturing. The research has been approached through action research in combination with a real case study at a manufacturing company in the energy sector. The Covid-19 pandemic fated that adjusted and new ways of communication, collaboration, and data collection, in relation to the methods, had to be explored and tried. Throughout the study, production data, such as processing times, have been collected and analyzed for discrete event simulation modelling. The complexity of introducing discrete event simulation as a new tool for decision making is highlighted, where we emphasize the human knowledge and involvement yet necessary to understand and to draw conclusions from the data. The results also demonstrate that the data analysis has given valuable insights into production characteristics, that need addressing. Thus, revealing opportunities for how the initiative of introducing discrete event simulation as an anew tool in the wake of industry 4.0, can act as a catalyst for improved decision making in future manufacturing.},

In particular, maintenance is one of the most researched applications, as the impact of the execution of maintenance task may have a great impact in the business of the companies. For example, in sector such as energy or manufacturing, a maintenance activity can cause the shutdown of an entire production line, or in the case of a wind turbine inspection, may face the safety of an operator to measure a simple indicator. Hence, the application of more intelligent maintenance strategies can offer huge benefits. In this context, this paper focuses on the review of DT applications for maintenance, as no previous work has been found with this aim. For instance, both “Digital Twin and “maintenance concepts and strategies are described in detail, and then a literature review is carried out where these two concepts are involved. In addition to identifying and analyzing how DTs are currently being applied for maintenance, this paper also highlights future research lines and open issues.},

The importance of BIM in this industry has been emphasized in previous research. However, strategies for the implementation of this system is still less explored, which requires more elaboration and validation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate such strategies considering all necessary dimensions of the BIM system in infrastructure construction projects. The findings are based on theoretical discussion and semi-structured interviews in a case study project in New South Wales, Australia. The results revealed that BIM integrates various elements of infrastructure construction, which include but are not limited to risk, time, cost, energy, safety, and sustainability. It was found that implementation strategies should focus on improving the contribution of the BIM system to infrastructure construction in terms of improved (1) integrity and automation, (2) collaboration, and (3) optimization. Identification of seven technical and managerial implementations strategies is the core contribution of this research. These strategies provide practitioners with insight into technical and managerial measures to be taken for the successful implementation of the BIM system.},

Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernel’s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique.},

The convergences and megatrends outlined in this chapter will happen. The convergence of exponential platforms will shape megatrends that will bring profound changes to the way we live, how our businesses operate, and the new ways our societies will function. This chapter provides information on 10 selected megatrends. They are hyper global connectivity, a longer and healthier life, augmented and virtual worlds, abundance, upgraded transportation, instant personalization, digitization of work, automated shopping, radical interfaces, and sustainable environment. The chapter considers various such platforms to illustrate how the convergence of these platforms is driving the megatrends and producing exceptional changes to our world. The platforms covered are Artificial Intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, networks and blockchain, material science, Internet of Things, quantum computing, and biotechnology.},

  abstract       = {The introduction of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) into manufacturing systems involves a wide range of opportunities and risks. The latter are critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and could either lead to their future success or jeopardize their economic survival. To scrutinize the impact of an I4.0 solution on their processes, SMEs need to assess their trans formed processes holistically with respect to numerous perspectives. Existing assessment approaches either focus on a single I4.0 solution in isolation, assess exclusively from the technological perspective, or lack an overall procedural and economic impact evaluation. The aim of this contribution is to develop a framework of performance metrics for the holistic impact evaluation of I4.0 solutions on SMEs. In the framework, we consolidate the impacts of technology applications discussed in the literature into 16 main fields of action and define adequate performance metrics to assess each of them. The resulting performance framework combines traditional metrics for the evaluation of supply chain processes i.e., supply chain operations reference-metrics and the global reporting initiative, and extends them with additional performance metrics relevant to the assessment of I4.0 solutions. This framework aims to facilitate and systemize the selection of adequate attributes for the evaluation of I4.0 solutions. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the practical utility of the framework and its convenience for the purpose of an assessment.},

  abstract       = {The Physical Internet (PI), a new vision for the future of the global freight transport and logistics system, describes a geographical hierarchy of interconnected networks of networks, from the urban, to the national, the continental, and the global level. Like today, in PI the maritime ports will fulfil roles as continental and global hubs. Differently than ports today, however, decisions to split and bundle cargo across ships and other modes will not be made solely on the basis of long-term agreements by ports, but rather ever more dynamically and in real-time, aiming to reconsolidate shipments within the port area. This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally. We provide insights into the approach’s applicability by means of the illustrative case of Teesport, located in Northeast England (United Kingdom).},

  abstract       = {The objective of this paper is to propose and test a graph-based approach for detection of critical infrastructure disruptions in social media data in disasters. Understanding the situation and disruptive events of critical infrastructure is essential to effective disaster response and recovery of communities. The potential of social media data for situation awareness during disasters has been highlighted in recent studies. However, the application of social sensing in detecting disruptions of critical infrastructure is limited because existing approaches cannot provide complete and non-ambiguous situational information about critical infrastructure. Therefore, to address this methodological gap, we developed a graph-based approach including data filtering, burst time-frame detection, content similarity and graph analysis. A case study of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Houston was conducted to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. The findings highlighted the temporal patterns of critical infrastructure events that occurred in disasters including disruptive events and their adverse impacts on communities. The findings also provided insights for better understanding critical infrastructure interdependencies in disasters. From the practical perspective, the proposed methodology study can improve the ability of community members, first responders and decision makers to detect and respond to infrastructure disruptions in disasters.},

Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.},

These technologies will improve processing efficiency, the creation of business opportunities, requirement regulation, information security, and transparency. While sharing electronic health records can assist in improving diagnosis accuracy, privacy and security preservation are imperative. In the network of IoT devices, that exchange involves sensitive medical data; patient monitoring has to be totally secured against privacy risks and attacks. Delays in treatment progress and emergency treatments could also result in medical data security and confidentiality violations. Applying blockchain technology to the healthcare industry could improve information security management; healthcare data could be analyzed and communicated while preserving the privacy and security of the data.

Data is produced, passed across interfaces, stored, processed, transformed and consumed. Improvements in communications technologies allow the interconnection of systems into ever greater Systems of Systems. In these large-scale System-of-Systems domains, we manage their scale by creating a series of abstractions; such as metadata and metamodels. The chapter also identifies the core use of data as an element in an information processing chain involving the collection of the data, transformation into information to be internalised to provide knowledge that can be employed to interact effectively within a given context. The Semiotic and DIKW models are provided as examples.},

Edge computing (EC), a novel computing paradigm innovation, has high potential to help with the digitization of SG. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of interdisciplinary research on EC applications in SG. First, an in-depth analysis of EC, including the definition, architectures, characteristics, and key enabling technologies is conducted from the perspective of SG application requirements. Afterward, this paper systematically explores application scenarios of EC in SG based on its characteristics. Beyond that, the synergistic effect of the integration of EC and SG is also assessed: SG not only benefits from EC but also supports EC to become sustainable. Challenges and open questions are then investigated.},

Technologies, such as the Internet of Things, information communication technology, and artificial intelligence, enable more efficient functions into logistics operations. However, they also change the narrative of logistics management. Scholars in the areas of engineering, logistics, transportation, and management are attracted by this revolution. Operations management research on smart logistics mainly concerns the application of underlying technologies, business logic, operation framework, related management system, and optimization problems under specific scenarios. To explore these studies, the related literature has been systematically reviewed in this work. On the basis of the research gaps and the needs of industrial practices, future research directions in this field are also proposed.},

The massive introduction of these technologies directly in the factories allows interconnecting the resources (machines and humans) and the entire production chain to be kept under control, thanks to the collection and the analyses of real production data, supporting the decision making process. This article aims to propose a methodological framework that, thanks to the use of Industrial Internet of Things—IoT devices, in particular the wearable sensors, and simulation tools, supports the analyses of production line performance parameters, by considering both experimental and numerical data, allowing a continuous monitoring of the line balancing and performance at varying of the production demand. A case study, regarding a manual task of a real manufacturing production line, is presented to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.},

This paper introduces the concept of Associative Cognitive Digital Twin, as a real time goal-oriented augmented virtual description, which explicitly includes the associated external relationships of the considered entity for the considered purpose. The corresponding graph data model, of the involved world, supports artificial consciousness, and allows an efficient understanding of involved ecosystems and related higher-level cognitive activities. The defined cognitive architecture for Symbiotic Autonomous Systems is mainly based on the consciousness framework developed.

This paper, to support automated driving systems (assisted, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles), introduces a cognitive layer called Associated Reality to enhance the involved information, knowledge and communication processes. The architecture defined includes an augmented Local Dynamic Map, with complementary layers, and an augmented Graph Database, with complementary semantic–cognitive relations, for the considered purpose, in cooperative human–machine and machine–machine systems. Virtual augmented landmarks are defined to improve the connectivity and intelligence of the involved spatial-information systems. Different structure landmarks and sequence landmarks (which includes regular, repetitive and periodic landmarks) are defined, categorized and used in diverse visual localization and mapping scenarios, for autonomous driving. In this paper, it is also shown, as a proof-of-concept for vehicle localization and mapping in road tunnels, the visual detection of different sequences of periodic luminaires, using YOLO v3 for the corresponding LED lights detection, or a specific alternative procedure developed with very low computational cost.},

  abstract       = {By its own meaning, a warship is a complex and expensive system, with a long acquisition cycle and a very long operational life. Therefore, the optimization of the lifecycle is increasingly important. One should not think only about the building or acquisition cost, but also about the cost through the lifecycle. The Spanish Navy (Armada) defines, on one hand, the lifecycle engineering as the set of the required activities in order to adapt the hull and the armament systems to their operational requirements, the configuration management and the definition, assessment and upgrade of the equipment support through their entire operational life. And on the other hand, the logistic support as the set of actions in order to provide the means required by their units/assets and systems to accomplish their missions. The marine industry around the warship world is immersed in the digitalization of all the logistics processes, which mainly refers to the maintenance process. In this paper we intend to reflect how the maintenance methods of the units/assets are to be based on the monitoring of equipment and how their centralized control is to be based on a detailed Maintenance Plan that would help to their preservation during their lifecycle. And also, reflect how the auxiliary marine industry, as part of the industrial technological base, may help to ease such maintenance. The methodology of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) aims to determine the operational maintenance based upon the operability of a system or equipment. This methodology, which has been adopted by the Armada, is of special importance considering the incorporation of the Center of Supervision and Data Analysis (CESADAR) to obtain the required 4.0 level.},

  abstract       = {As manufacturing industry is moving its steps towards a more digital, smart and flexible scenario, the changes required to achieve the expectations of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) framework are numerous and extensive. Though, a general lack of understanding of how new technologies could be integrated and shall be implemented is present, limiting the rate of adoption of such changes and the related beneficial impacts. This paper describes the implementation of a smart-factory at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) aiming at filling the gap in I4.0 related skills development thorough a learning by doing approach, and providing a research platform that could foster collaboration of practitioners and academia on the development and testing of new technologies. The developed factory integrates different production technologies such as additive manufacturing, laser processing and milling, in order to produce a highly customizable item consisting in a TANGRAM game-set, packaged into personalized boxes. The entire factory is coupled with its digital twin, which is fed by an exhaustive monitoring infrastructure composed by vision systems and high precision measurement instruments, allowing to track in real time plant processes. The design has been carried out in order to make the smart factory serving as a mean to face both educational and research challenges at many different levels. As an educational mean, students and professionals have the chance to dive into manufacturing history experiencing both classical automation topics (PLC, MES and SCADA programming, precision axes control and pneumatics), as well as more advanced technologies, typical of the most advanced smart-factories (IoT, vision systems, simulation and digital twin, advanced measuring methods and smart production management systems). From a research point of view, the factory functions as a pilot plant for internal research and applied industrial projects, on the top of which applications, manufacturing methods and technologies are developed, tested and integrated.},

Welcoming IoT will bring significant benefits to economies and businesses as it enables greater innovation and productivity. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of IoT presents new challenges regarding connectivity, security, data processing, and scalability. Because the IoT world is vast and versatile, it cannot be viewed as a single technology. IoT looks more like an umbrella covering many protocols, technologies, and concepts that depend on specific industries. In this chapter, we will seek to look at the history of IoT, more clearly define it, and review its terms and concepts. We will also review vertical IoT markets and higher-level use cases that have successfully adopted IoT solutions. We will also discuss the details of the business implications, business models, and opportunities of IoT. Finally, the complete IoT stack and reference architectures from smart objects, to the networks, to the cloud, and finally the applications where information is leveraged are explained.},

The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)-including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics-as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

Maxim Gorkiy, which sailed into an ice belt southwest of Svalbard in 1989, experienced a similar lack of information. The hull was damaged, and passengers, crew, and ships were rescued due to extremely good weather conditions and courageous on-scene commanders. For both accidents, had the navigators on board received information in time, they would have been able to choose another and safer route, and the accidents could have been avoided.

From the Titanic days up to now, the ICT maturity has grown rapidly. We are also heading for digital transformation in shipping, that we do not know the consequences of, but we know that shipping sector will be changed, and the ICT will be one of the most important driving factors for sustainability. In parallel with the development, we must ensure that the human interactions will be taken care of. Therefore, the introduction of new technology should include the “human in the loop, the user aspects, and must have focus on the integration between Man, Technology, and Organization (MTO).

In this chapter we will describe some of the central ICT solutions used for sustainable shipping and the way they are operated and give examples on existing and future trends that influence sustainability where the ICT’s role in the process is elaborated.},

Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the ideal case of a ``digital twin″. The modeling of the ground goes beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major international projects clearly show that the optimization of construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the introduction of an infrastructure information model, which contains the three submodels ground, building and construction site. The main focus will be on underground construction, more precisely on mechanized tunnelling.},

We decompose the Optimal Power Flow problem using a blockchain-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and we comment on efficiency, trust, security and transparency issues. The successive iterants of the solution of the power flow problem are securely stored on the blockchain, removing the need for a central operating authority, while allowing network nodes to verify the validity and optimality of the solution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm presented through simulation experiments on the 39-bus New England transmission system, and IEEE-57 and IEEE-118 benchmark systems. We systematically compare the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with well established blockchain consensus algorithms. The results show that our method maintains the convergence characteristics of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers iterative scheme and enables independent network nodes to reach consensus.},

Including security as part of a software-intensive technical system (i.e., the CPS) that can be distributed and highly resilient highlights the need for appropriate security methodologies to be applied on the CPS from the engineering stage during CPS design. The efficient security-related processes that are implemented at design time have an impact on security monitoring during the CPS operational phase (at run-time). Efficient and accurate security monitoring that follows security-by-design principles can be a potent tool in the hands of the CPS manager for detecting and mitigating cyber threats. Monitoring traffic and activity at the system boundaries, detecting changes to device status and configuration, detecting suspicious activity indicating attacks, detecting unauthorized activity that is suspicious or violates security policies, and timely responding to security incidents and recovering from them are issues that need to be efficiently tackled with by security monitoring. In this chapter, we explore the various CPS cybersecurity threats and discuss how adding security as a parameter at the CPS design phase can provide a well-structured and efficient approach on providing strong security CPS foundations. New technologies on CPS security design are presented and emerging security directions are discussed. Furthermore, in the chapter, the different aspects of security monitoring are presented with a special emphasis on CPSs, discussing the various existing monitoring approaches that are followed in order to detect security issues at run-time. Specific use cases of CPSs in the manufacturing domain and with reference to critical infrastructures are also detailed and security requirements like confidentiality, integrity, and availability are discussed.},

  abstract       = {In the last century, the automotive industry has arguably transformed society, being one of the most complex, sophisticated, and technologically advanced industries, with innovations ranging from the hybrid, electric, and self-driving smart cars to the development of IoT-connected cars. Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing systems, cyber-physical systems, or augmented reality. One of the latest technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain, which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability, accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness, and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges. Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it. Finally, after strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry developments.},

In the meantime, the 4th industrial revolution, characterized by several technologies that allow digitalisation, optimisation, automation, customisation and more communication, is in progress. Thus, the ‘Industry 4.0’ can be an enabler for industrial sustainable development. Maintenance processes, which are fundamental for ensuring sustainable operation of manufacturing systems, can benefit from these technologies, with a consequent improvement of maintenance and manufacturing performance. Therefore, a strong synergy between I4.0 technologies and industrial maintenance processes for promoting sustainable manufacturing occurs. Nevertheless, to date, no study investigates thoroughly the effects of such potential synergy on sustainable manufacturing. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, identifying the relation between maintenance processes and I4.0 technologies; then, analysing the positive effects of their integration on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable manufacturing. Finally, a preliminary analysis was also conducted to shed light on the negative effects of this synergy on sustainability.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is creating a radically more dynamic work environment, which calls for considerable changes in the role of industry professionals. As industries need to respond to evolving trends quickly, as well professionals need to be able to work and constantly learning in this new work environment. Besides, due to the continuous advances in technology and the adoption of these technologies in the industries processes, the level of complexity in the workplace is increasing, which results in the need for a new professional role. However, the main challenge is how to prepare and qualify these professionals to acquire these competences. In order to provide a better understanding of the new professional role and their relationship with the industry 4.0 working environment, this paper introduces an ontology for Competence Management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Considering the recent scientific and business developments for preparing the industries and workers for this new working era, competences and skills needed for professionals in industry 4.0 were reviewed, as well as challenges and opportunities. Based on a systematic literature review in scientific sources and grey literature, this work identified what technologies are being adopted and what the professional competences are for working in this working environment. Since Industry 4.0 is spreading all over the world, this study contributes to this understanding and also provides a starting point for further research regarding workforce competence management for Industry 4.0.},

These concepts are validated by performing novelty detection on open access UAV flight data with GPS spoofing attacks, which represents a typical system use-case. Multiple machine learning models are trained to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting modern cyber-intrusions and anomalies using the digital-twin architecture. This includes both classical and deep learning techniques to help identify the most suitable model types for the proposed design.

Along with the advances in new generation information technologies, smart manufacturing is becoming the focus of global manufacturing transformation. Considering the competitive nature of industry, it requires manufacturers to implement new methodologies. Realistic virtual models mirroring the real world are becoming essential to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. In this paper model conceptualization, representation, and implementation of the digital twin is presented, on the real use case of manufacturing industry and in the cyber physical environment. A novel CPS architecture for real time visualization of complex industrial process is proposed. It essentially considers the Simulation technological pillar of Industry 4.0. The results from a real industrial environment show good performances in terms of real time behaviour, virtual reality and WebGL CPS visualization features, usability and readability.},

  abstract       = {A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.},

The digitalization process uses digital technologies to provide the possibilities of new revenue and value-producing, i.e., it changes business models and offers new value propositions. This change is ongoing. The most important ten strategic technology trends in 2019 include Edge computing, Blockchain, event and data-driven strategies, Digital Twins, and the maintenance of transparency (i.e., traceability), Intelligent Apps and Analytics (Gartner 2018). In this paper, we experiment with the capabilities of intelligent applications to match the industrial business needs. This paper aims to bring insights closer to business objectives. Digitalization’s technological advantages can be achieved through data-driven strategies and wherein cognitive services are integrated into IoT (Internet of Things) and big data. We experiment with the Industrial IoT (IIoT) business models and value propositions to match the intelligent insights of cognitive solutions to business objectives. The IIoTs support and demand transparency and thus also data-driven objective insights, and because cognitive solutions can enhance insights on a product, a process or service and therefore provide measurable business objectives. Functional indicators enable interconnected smart things to collaborate.},

This allows competitive operations in time, costs, and quality, which have been widely discussed. On the downside, it entails cyber threats with significant risks for society in areas including business, environment, and health. Hence, to adequately manage these risks in the emerging digital world, there is a vital necessity to raise awareness, establish, maintain, and further develop cyber-security measures to ensure an appropriate level of protection along the entire value chain and supply chain. Blockchain capabilities are introduced to improve the technical and organizational basis for secured operations in industrial networks. Its advantages are explained by a simple USB-device use case, that has often been the root cause to subsequent security incidents, especially in the Stuxnet incident.},

Investments into applications of these technologies in agriculture, forestry and the extraction of marine resources also seem to be increasing rapidly. Despite a growing interest in, and deployment of AI-technologies in domains critical for sustainability, few have explored possible systemic risks in depth. This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience. We explore these emerging risks, identify critical questions, and discuss the limitations of current governance mechanisms in addressing AI sustainability risks in these sectors.},

  abstract       = {Continuous manufacturing, an emerging technology in the pharmaceutical industry, has the potential to increase the efficiency, and agility of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. To realize these potential benefits of continuous operations, effectively managing materials, equipment, analyzers, and data is vital. Developments for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing have led to novel technologies and methods for processing material, designing and configuring individual equipment and process analyzers, as well as implementing strategies for active process control. However, limited work has been reported on managing abnormal conditions during operations to prevent unplanned deviations and downtime and sustain system capabilities. Moreover, although the sourcing, analysis, and management of real-time data have received growing attention, limited discussion exists on the continued verification of the infrastructure for ensuring reliable operations. Hence, this work introduces condition-based maintenance (CBM) as a general strategy for continually verifying and sustaining advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing systems, with a focus on the continuous manufacture of oral solid drug products (OSD-CM). Frameworks, such as CBM, benefit unified efforts towards continued verification and operational excellence by leveraging process knowledge and the availability of real-time data. A vital implementation consideration for manufacturing operations management applications, such as CBM, is a systems architecture and an enabling infrastructure. This work outlines the systems architecture design for CBM in OSD-CM and highlights sample fault scenarios involving equipment and process analyzers. For illustrative purposes, this work also describes the infrastructure implemented on an OSD-CM testbed, which uses commercially available automation systems and leverages enterprise architecture standards. With the increasing digitalization of manufacturing operations in the pharmaceutical industry, proactively using process data towards modernizing maintenance practices is relevant to a single unit operation as well as to a series of physically integrated unit operations.},

  abstract       = {Equipment manufacturers are currently utilizing new digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, or Big Data, for new digital offerings. However, these offerings seldom enhance revenue, because companies struggle with business model (BM) dynamics. By analyzing 27 companies through an explorative case-study approach, the authors consider how companies can successfully achieve revenue enhancement through digital offerings. The result is a threefold framework for revenue enhancement through digital offerings. First, this framework distinguishes between three phases of BM dynamics: 1) augmenting products through a “hardware plus logic, 2) developing a portfolio of multiple logics for creating customer value, 3) integrating this portfolio through platform logic. Second, the framework emphasizes that three barriers, which we refer to as confidence, mixing, and collaboration barrier, limit the progress from Phases 1 to 3. Third, the framework reveals that each phase contains certain modifications of BM components. In the first phase, companies adapt their BM components slightly, so as to advance toward a “hardware plus logic. In the second phase, companies embrace more radical BM innovations in order to convert services into an outcome-based BM and develop a new software subscription BM. In the third phase, companies modify BM components in order to integrate the BMs internally and to open them up for external collaboration partners.},

While the approach so far has gained interest mainly due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations, recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention within the research community. In this article, we discuss how a digital twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes. We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other security components of the architecture. We also make performance evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using the proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides a foundation for future research work in this promising new area.},

Many of these aspects also ensure and improve functional safety, privacy, and security in process execution. However, managed business processes lack flexibility; ie, changing a business process requires more effort than ad hoc execution and adaptation. Thus, especially in small companies, the acceptance rate of managed business processes is low. So we claim that in current BPM approaches, the structuredness ensuring functional safety and security concepts contradicts with the objective for flexibility. The main goal of the AdaBPM project is to address this contradiction by providing a formal approach to handle advanced adaptations and exception handling in business processes. The technical objectives of the project include (1) the definition of a basic framework being capable of handling different levels of adaptivity and considering security and safety requirements at the same time, (2) a rigorous process specification language and model refinement methods, (3) static business process adaptations, and (4) dynamic (or ad hoc) adaptations. The result of our research is a general approach for flexible BPM combined with the possibility to nevertheless manage the process and define safety and security restrictions.},

Strategic planning for data centers encompass a global location plan, site selection, design, construction, and operations. The chapter also discusses applicable design guidelines and considerations. It further discusses some of operations technologies (OTs). Workforce development plays a vital role in successful application of OT. Statistics show that over 70% of all data centers were brought down by human errors such as improper executing procedures during maintenance. It is imperative to have detailed business continuity and disaster recovery plans that are well prepared and executed.},

The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. ‘Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement’ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders – leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians – to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.},

The present study performs a content-centric qualitative review of the extant digitalization literature to identify the primary energy sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. The interpretive structural modeling technique is further used for mapping the interrelationships among various energy sustainability functions identified. The interpretive model developed, and the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement analysis offered exciting insights into the Industry 4.0-energy sustainability interactions. Findings show that Industry 4.0 promotes energy sustainability via a very complex mechanism that involves ten interrelated functions. Contrary to the general opinion, production efficiency offered by the digitalization of the manufacturing industry is not the immediate and most essential energy efficiency outcome of the digital industrial transformation. Industry 4.0 primarily contributes to energy sustainability by enabling the energy industry to reshape its operating landscape and enjoy more advanced, intelligent, and complicated energy production and distribution equipment. The digitalization of the energy demand sector, digitalization of the manufacturing industry, and the introduction of smarter and more sustainable products are among the main opportunities of Industry 4.0 for energy sustainability. Overall, the study and the ISM model of energy sustainability developed explains how Industry 4.0 contributes to energy sustainability via different functions and how each function is placed within the structural model based on its driving and dependence powers.},

Industry 4.0 literature is growing exponentially, overexpanding the current understanding of the digital industrial revolution through thousands of academic publications. This unprecedented growth calls for a systematic review of the concept, scope, definition, and functionality of Industry 4.0. Such systematic review should address the existing ambiguities and deliver a clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of this phenomenon, including the possible implications for sustainability. Consistently, the present study carried out a systematic literature review of related articles, published online within the Industry 4.0 discipline until November 2020. The systematic literature review identified 745 eligible articles and applied extensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis methodically. The study provides a descriptive assessment of eligible articles’ properties and offers a unified conceptualization of Industry 4.0 and the underlying building blocks. The study explains how the implications of Industry 4.0 for value creation expand beyond the manufacturing industry. The study further describes the sustainability value drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and identifies the conditions on which digital industrial transformation success lays. Overall, findings reveal that Industry 4.0 transformation could address pressing issues of sustainable development goals, particularly concerning the manufacturing-economic development. The study also draws on the findings and offers important theoretical and practical implications, highlights the existing gaps within the literature, and discusses the possible future research directions.},

  abstract       = {Digital twins can assist machine tools in performing their monitoring and troubleshooting tasks autonomously from the context of smart manufacturing. For this, a special type of twin denoted as sensor signal-based twin must be constructed and adapted into the cyber-physical systems. The twin must (1) machine-learn the required knowledge from the historical sensor signal datasets, (2) seamlessly interact with the real-time sensor signals, (3) handle the semantically annotated datasets stored in clouds, and (4) accommodate the data transmission delay. The development of such twins has not yet been studied in detail. This study fills this gap by addressing sensor signal-based digital twin development for intelligent machine tools. Two computerized systems denoted as Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS) are proposed to construct and adapt the twin, respectively. The modular architectures of the proposed DTCS and DTAS are presented in detail. The real-time responses and delay-related computational arrangements are also elucidated for both systems. The systems are also developed using a Java™-based platform. Milling torque signals are used as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of DTCS and DTAS. This study thus contributes toward the advancement of intelligent machine tools from the context of smart manufacturing.},

  abstract       = {Smart and ongoing commissioning (SOCx) of buildings can result in a significant reduction in the gap between design and operational performance. Ontologies play an important role in SOCx as they facilitate data readability and reasoning by machines. A better understanding of ontologies is required in order to develop and incorporate them in SOCx. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art research on building data ontologies since 2014 within the SOCx domain through sorting them based on building data types, general approaches, and applications. The data types of two main domains of building information modeling and building management system have been considered in the majority of existing ontologies. Three main applications are evident from a critical analysis of existing ontologies: (1) key performance indicator calculation, (2) building performance improvement, and (3) fault detection and diagnosis. The key gaps found in the literature review are a holistic ontology for SOCx and insight on how such approaches should be evaluated. Based on these findings, this study provides recommendations for future necessary research including: identification of SOCx-related data types, assessment of ontology performance, and creation of open-source approaches.},

  abstract       = {As one of the earliest developed antimicrobial classes, sulfonamides remain important therapeutic options for the empiric and definitive treatment of various infectious diseases. In the general population, approximately 3–8% of patients are reported to experience a sulfonamide allergy. Sulfonamide allergies can result in various physical manifestations; however, rash is reported as the most frequently observed. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dermatologic reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobial agents occur 10 to 20 times more frequently compared to immunocompetent patients. This article describes the incidence, manifestations, and risk factors associated with sulfonamide allergies. The potential for cross-reactivity of allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials with nonantimicrobial sulfonamide medications is also reviewed. Data suggest that substitutions at the N1 and N4 positions are the primary determinants of drug allergy instead of the common sulfonamide moiety. For patients with an indication for a sulfonamide antimicrobial with a listed allergy, it is important for healthcare practitioners to adequately assess the allergic reaction to determine appropriate management. Rechallenge and desensitization strategies may be appropriate for patients with delayed maculopapular eruptions, while alternative treatment options may be prudent for more severe reactions. Available data suggests a low risk of cross-allergenicity between sulfonamide antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial agents.},

  abstract       = {&#x0D;&#x0D;&#x0D;Coordinating agents to complete a set of tasks with intercoupled temporal and resource constraints is computationally challenging, yet human domain experts can solve these difficult scheduling problems using paradigms learned through years of apprenticeship. A process for manually codifying this domain knowledge within a computational framework is necessary to scale beyond the "single-expert, single-trainee" apprenticeship model. However, human domain experts often have difficulty describing their decision-making processes. We propose a new approach for capturing this decision-making process through counterfactual reasoning in pairwise comparisons. Our approach is model-free and does not require iterating through the state space. We demonstrate that this approach accurately learns multifaceted heuristics on a synthetic and real world data sets. We also demonstrate that policies learned from human scheduling demonstration via apprenticeship learning can substantially improve the efficiency of schedule optimization. We employ this human-machine collaborative optimization technique on a variant of the weapon-to-target assignment problem. We demonstrate that this technique generates optimal solutions up to 9.5 times faster than a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm.&#x0D;&#x0D;&#x0D;},

  abstract       = {Modeling and simulation techniques are today extensively used both in industry and science. Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition, experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques. Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems. Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings. In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges. To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation. To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.},

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are then able to generate more examples from the estimated probability distribution. Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is the term commonly used in Europe to describe the combination of a number of emerging and rapidly evolving technologies that represent the state of the art in the Manufacturing Industry today. Going beyond simply the automation of manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 involves the convergence of information and automation technology to create cyber-physical systems which virtualize and optimise the manufacturing process on a global scale. The traditional unidisciplinary or multidisciplinary engineering approach has been extremely successful for the provision of Mechatronics Engineers for Industry 3.0 over the past decades. But the complexities of the cyber physical systems which must be implemented as part of Industry 4.0 require a much more comprehensive systems engineering approach. This has resulted in the requirement for the new occupation of Equipment Systems Engineers (ESE) who have been introduced to, and are capable of utilizing an interdisciplinary or even anti-disciplinary approach. This paper describes the development and implementation of an Industry-Led Masters programme at the University of Limerick which was designed specifically to meet the unique skillset required for this rapidly developing field. The development of a unique Industry 4.0 teaching space is described as well as the creation of three manufacturing cells and their ‘digital twins’ which recreate the environment found in the field. They allow Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies to be used to interact remotely with the equipment. Close collaboration with Industry Experts is a strong feature of the design and delivery of the programme. The teaching methods were also novel and an implementation of the CDIO method is described. The programme recently received the award of ‘Best New Masters Programme’ in a field of competitors across all Irish Universities and disciplines.},

We highlight HCI challenges, issues and implications, including sensemaking and the generation of design insight. We further challenge current notions of data-driven design and envision ways in which future HCI research can develop ways to work with data in the design process in a connected, rich, human manner.},

General Electric (GE) predicts that $1.3 trillion of value can be captured in the electricity value chain from 2016 to 2025 by IoT. SCADA, PLC, smart meters and smart devices are few old examples of IoT. What is new that would create so much value in power sector is deployment of smart devices, advance analytics, advance dash board, cloud computing and the integration of several services into a common platform due to drastic reduction in prices of Wi-Fi chipsets and availability of variety of sensors like accelerometers, cameras, tactile, sound, temperatures and others. The three global digital themes for electricity industry from generation to consumption are; (1) Asset Management, (2) Operation Optimization, and (3) Enhanced Customer Services. The Indian power sector is facing several challenges such as high AT&C losses, poor reliability, public and political demand to keep tariff low, integration of high RE capacity into the grid and aging infrastructure. IoT can support resolution of most. This paper will attempt to identify, IoT applications for India power sector, Challenges and way forward.},

It includes development of a data-driven digital twin, which represents the security and resilience concerns of the network and is used to diagnose security incidents and to formulate a resilient response to these incidents. Application of the proposed method extension is illustrated using examples of secure computer network governance and secure supplier onboarding.},

Changes are primarily due to increased product complexity and the connection to the internet of things and services, enabling Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). Major innovations of the revised VDI guideline 2206 for developing mechatronic systems are systems thinking as a core element and six checkpoints for structuring deliverables along the V-Model. These checkpoints serve for orientation in result progress and thus enable a structured and complete development process. However, tasks and checkpoints of the new guideline focus on the product development itself without integrating the development of related CPPS, enabling optimization simultaneously to system development. Implications are derived by a three-step analysis. The paper at hand contributes fundamental extensions of the checkpoint questions regarding integrated CPPS development. These questions provide methodical support for system developers of CPPS for CPS by enabling the project manager to check the status, schedule further development steps and evaluate the maturity of the whole, integrated development.},

Smart manufacturing operations planning and control program, as defined by NIST, implement advances in measurement science that enable performance, quality, interoperability, wireless and cybersecurity standards for real-time prognostics and health monitoring, control, and optimization of smart manufacturing systems.

The traditional production processes and plants are evolving following this digitalization combining the long experience and the AI-driven methods to improve the production efficiency, to accelerate the fine-tuning and real-time adjustment of the process parameters oriented to the zero defect quality. The digitalization of multi-stages production processes (e.g. foundry) plays a key role in competitiveness introducing new integrated platform to monitor the process through an intelligent sensors network and predict quality and cost of castings in real-time.

The application presented in this paper is the main outcome of EU FP7-MUSIC project giving a new age to the traditional multi-stages production. The actual regional project PreMANI (POR FESR 2014–2020) is a new extended application of AI-driven digital twin in manufacturing process and quality control. This paper demonstrates the applicability of data-driven digital twins to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and to complex manufacturing sectors integrating the process monitoring with advance data mining and cognitive approach to predict the quality, the efficiency vs cost and react in real-time with the support of decision support system.},

At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.},

  abstract       = {Industrial collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. In particular, human-robot collaboration in assembly will be particularly interesting for manufacturing companies. In this context, the interaction between humans and robots opens new possibilities but also challenges. A major problem is related to safety: unwanted and unexpected contacts between the human and the robotic system may cause injuries and therefore limit the potential for collaboration. Nowadays, there is a lack of simple and practical tools for helping system designers in overcoming such limiting conditions. In this work, guidelines for the design of safe human-robot collaborative assembly are developed and classified, particularly focusing on the features characterizing the entire system. These are validated by means of a laboratory case study and a digital twin. The validation process is based on the assumption that a team of manufacturing engineers (not-experts in occupational health and safety) should be able to autonomously and gradually apply the given guidelines reducing the mechanical risk in a collaborative assembly system. The proposed solutions have been virtually modelled allowing the evaluation of their effectiveness. According to the results, the proposed guidelines effectively help non-expert users in the development and improvement of collaborative assembly systems from the safety perspective.},

A key technology behind this opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge through an informed and intelligent robotized automation is the robotic digital twin (RDT). As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This paper contributes to addressing this gap. We introduce a novel concept for the development of a RDT that helps create and add value to current and future robotized cyber-physical applications. Hereinafter referred to as the value-driven RDT (vdRDT), it systematically captures the robot dynamics and purposefully farms data, about which its services reason to facilitate insight and deliver capabilities and benefits to stakeholders. Experiment results show that vdRDTs enlarge the scope of, adapt to, and revitalize robotized applications carried out in different fields.&lt;/div&gt;},

In this study, our main ambition is to provide readers with a comprehensive review of publications which lie within the intersection of Industry 4.0, digitization in manufacturing, and simulation. To achieve this, we follow a two-stage review methodology. Firstly, we review several academic databases and discuss the impact and application domain of a number of selected papers. Secondly, we perform a direct Google Scholar search and present numerical results on global trends for the related technologies between years 2011 and 2018. Our reviews show that simulation is in the heart of most of the technologies Industry 4.0 utilises or provides. Simulation has significant role in Industry 4.0 in terms of supporting development and deployment of its technologies such as Cyber-Physical System (CPS), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Smart Factory, Digital Twin, and Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally in terms of management of these technologies, simulation helps design, operate and optimise processes in factories.},

Industry 4.0, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, comprises of advanced technologies such as robotics, autonomous transportation and production machinery, additive manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT), 5G mobile communication, sensors, systems integration, Cloud, big data, data analytics, and simulation. Such technologies are used in the production of quality goods, which increased product diversity, and often at lower costs achieved through optimisation and smart production techniques. The goals of Industry 4.0 are to achieve Smart Factories and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The introductory chapter presents concepts from Industry 4.0 and contextualises the role of simulation in bringing about this new industrial age. The history of the industrial revolutions and simulation are discussed. Major concepts in Industry 4.0, such as CPS, vertical and horizontal system integration, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Cloud, big data, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and additive manufacturing are evaluated in the context of simulation. The discussions show that computer simulation is intrinsic to several of these Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies, for example, the application of simulation in hybrid modelling (e.g., digital twins), simulation-based training, data analytics (e.g., prescriptive analytics through the use of computer simulation), designing connectivity (e.g., network simulation), and simulation-based product design. Simulation has a pivotal role in realising the vision of Industry 4.0, and it would not be farfetched to say that simulation is at the heart of Industry 4.0.},

Aiming at the cloudification of manufacturing equipment in the cloud manufacturing environment, the 3D printer is selected as the research object, and a cloud-edge collaboration architecture for 3D printers based on digital twin is proposed. To solve the lack of network reliability brought about by traditional cloudification, time-sensitive services are deployed at the edge, realizing the local extension of cloud services. The digital twin information model of FDM additive manufacturing is defined. Real time controlling and monitoring based on digital twin is realized. By cloud-edge collaboration, an application case is implemented, which verifies the effectiveness of the system and provides a reference solution for the cloudification of other manufacturing equipment in the environment of cloud manufacturing.},

  abstract       = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain (\textlessitalic\textgreaterdigital thread\textless/italic\textgreater) with the physical supply chain and their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further, we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.},

Our aim is to enable the construction of a large variety of applications that take advantage of place to render relevant content and functionality and thus, improve user experience. We consider elements of context that are particularly related to mobile computing. The main problems we have addressed to realize our place-oriented mobile computing vision, are representing places, recognizing places, engineering place-aware applications. We describe the approaches we have developed for addressing these problems and related subproblems. A key element of our work is the use of collaborative information sharing where users’ devices share and integrate knowledge about places. Our place ontology facilitates such collaboration. Declarative privacy policies allow users to specify contextual features under which they prefer to share or not share their information.},

  abstract       = {The information fusion field has recently been attracting a lot of interest within the scientific community, as it provides, through the combination of different sources of heterogeneous information, a fuller and/or more precise understanding of the real world than can be gained considering the above sources separately. One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.},

This paper presents a cyber digital twin, based on attack graph analytics, that automatically gathers and prioritizes security controls requirements at scale over active networks. The first-of-a-kind twin collects information about the computer network, associates it with attack tactics, measures the efficiency of implemented security controls requirements and automatically detects missing security controls. The twin also evaluates a cyber risk value using the attack graph and proposes prioritization of the detected requirements to rapidly reduce risk within existing system constraints. The cyber digital twin simulator offers several new risk reduction methods for automatically selecting security controls requirements. The necessary data for constructing a contextual cyber digital twin is defined, including the relationship between security controls and attack tactics. The paper illustrates the calculations used for ranking security controls' risk impact, the algorithm for security controls' requirements prioritization, and finally demonstrates successful results using a field experiment conducted via an active network.},

The main trends of the development of the cyber-physical structure presented in Gartner’s Hype Cycle 2017 are described to apply them in science, education, transport, industry and state structures. Prospective directions of the market-feasible technologies, related to green cyber-social monitoring and management of society, are proposed. An expanded description of technologies focused on the creation of the smart digital world, green cities and 5G telecommunications is performed. Recommendations are given for leveraging the top 10 technologies of 2017 in business, scientific and educational processes of higher education. Technologies of emotional-logical computing, a metric for measuring social relations along horizontal and vertical connections, rules of human behavior, focused on creating the emotional logic for modeling and simulation human behavior are proposed. A cyber-physical model of green statehood for the metric management of resources and citizens is introduced; it is based on digital monitoring and assessment of the needs of citizens, including components of social computing (relations, goals, management, personnel, infrastructure, resources), ordered by the degree of their influence on the market success.},

  abstract    = {The advent of communication technologies and smart storage gave rise to the concept of smart cities. One of the key enabling technologies of smart living is the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of application including critical national infrastructure (CNI) such as transport, hospitals and power distribution grid. The proliferation in IoT applications raised many serious security and privacy concerns to citizens, businesses and governments. CNI systems depend heavily on IoT devices and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) to perform autonomous actions or inform human decision makers through the exchange and processing of data. Recently, blockchain has been advocated as a solution for secure data storage and sharing. Blockchain cryptographically offers a secure platform for maintaining a decentralised, append-only, publicly verifiable and immutable data structure, which is timestamped and sequentially ordered by its reference to previous block hashes. The immutability and security of blockchain can improve the CNI protection. Two specific smart CNI enabling technologies that would highly benefit from blockchain are IoT and CPS. Digital twins are virtual replica&nbsp;of the&nbsp;network and&nbsp;logic layer of&nbsp;physical system. A digital twin provides a platform to solve major IoT related CNI cybersecurity challenges in tomorrow’s secure infrastructure, energy distribution, smart cities, smart manufacturing (Industrial IoT and Industry4.0) and autonomous transit systems. This key note discussion outlines how to implement blockchain as a fundamental theory for trustless security for connected CNI. It will investigate technologies which can be utilised to achieve a trustless matrix such as blockchain and peer-distributed security systems, for instance onion-routing, with the wider aim of defining trustless security further. The research also considers the feasibility of trustless IoT security systems and their application in CNI. It investigate the present state-of-the-art in cybersecurity as it relates to trustless security technologies and blockchain and what is the present state of the art of cybersecurity in IoT-enabled CNI systems.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is about realizing digital transformation by linking machines to plants, fleets, and humans through sensors and control elements in order to create smart networks, smart factories, smart manufacturing, and smart value chains. By leveraging I4.0 technologies, a small and medium enterprise (SME) can increase its organizational agility, adaptability, and resilience to cope with today's competitive environment by becoming a valuable and innovative partner in the power dynamics with its large buyer counterparts. However, SMEs face technology, trust, and big data challenges when they adopt I4.0 technologies. This study provides new solutions for SMEs to overcome these three challenges in implementing I4.0. Specifically, the paper proposes the following: (1) a roadmap for the application of I4.0 technologies to enhance the collaboration capabilities of SMEs; (2) a structure for I4.0 standardization to develop and sustain trust among partners; and (3) an improved data science platform for systematizing big data to extract critical information for collaboration solutions for SMEs. Additionally, the solutions are evaluated based on an application case of a Greek SME, demonstrating their potentials for practical implementation.},

Many publications regarding these topics have been published, but they are primarily focused on larger enterprises. However, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered the economic backbone of many countries, which is why it is increasingly important that these kinds of companies also have easy access to these technologies and can make them operational. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and investigation of how widespread AI and IoT are among manufacturing SMEs, and discusses the current limitations and opportunities towards enabling predictive analytics. Firstly, an overview of the enablers for AI and IoT is provided along with the four analytics capabilities. Hereafter a comprehensive literature review is conducted and its findings showcased. Finally, emerging topics of research and development, making AI and IoT accessible technologies to SMEs, and the associated future trends and challenges are summarised.},

  abstract       = {The evolution from local toward virtualized data storage, computing, applications and services – in the forms of Internet of Things (IoT), Everything as a Service (EaaS), and Cloud computing – has changed the way of delivering digital services for consumers and businesses. These technologies have brought clear benefits over traditional systems, such as easy management, universal availability, and decreased hardware requirements for end-user devices. The main challenges of the first-generation IoT services are related to communication latency due to high physical and logical distance between end nodes and server resources and vulnerability for network problems along the long routes. Thanks to the unveiling of the fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) for cellular networks, the last-mile connection performance – communication latency in particular – is taking a huge leap and therefore introducing new possibilities for industrial applications. Edge computing is a key technology to unleash the full potential of the arising industrial wireless communication, since it enables deploying computational tasks to computing nodes near the end devices and therefore opens novel business opportunities around real-time cloud services. In this chapter, we introduce the current state of the art and discuss different challenges the edge computing systems are facing particularly in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) domain, as well as present potential solutions for the identified challenges.},

  abstract       = {One approach to developing futuristic views of technology is to draw upon experience and expertise. However, this becomes increasingly speculative as one moves to more distant timelines and visionary technological forms. This raises the question of whether it is possible to rationally predict how a technology development trajectory might unfold into the future, perhaps to some ‘ultimate form’, that is accessible, surfaces the necessary technological features for development as well as considers the implications for human–artefact relationships. The proposed approach is conceptually grounded in a parsimonious framework that examines different configurations of human–artefact relationships, revealing ‘Six Genres of Technology’. This suggests how the shift from human-human to artefact-artefact and the increasing autonomy of the artefacts (technological beings), introduces specific features to each of the six Genres. Four features are identified in the later Genres that in combination, could be construed as, or indeed pose a threat: autonomy, intelligence, language, and autopoiesis. This paper advances the debate about future technological developments by using the proposed framework to structure an argument about the key issues that should be discussed today - so that the developments of tomorrow can be more reflectively considered, appropriately debated and knowingly pursued.},

However, many of the CMaaS platforms are centralized with data flowing through an intermediary agent connecting clients with service providers. This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.},

  abstract       = {Blockchain based decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS) platforms enable customers to gain access to a large capacity of manufacturing nodes over cryptographically secure networks. In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem.},

Therefore, cyber security training is becoming mandatory both for simple users and security experts. Cyber ranges constitute an advance training technique where trainees gain hands-on experiences on a safe virtual environment, which can be a realistic digital twin of an actual system. This paper presents the cyber ranges platform THREAT-ARREST. Its design is fully model-driven and offers all modern training features (i.e. emulation, simulation, serious games, and fabricated data).

Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.},

Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution.

For unknown model parameters, the adaptive system identification is proposed to model closed-loop virtual systems and residual signals with fault-free case data. Performance indices are improved to make the design of robust monitoring and diagnosis system to identify the apparatus status. Soft-sensor, parameterization control, and model-matching reconfiguration are ameliorated and incorporated into the optimized control configuration to guarantee stable and safe control performance under apparatus faults. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed digital twin system are evaluated by using different simulations on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process in the presence of realistic fault scenarios.

However, the training data of speech recognition may expose personal information such as voice prints. We have heard some cases of fraud using synthetic voices. Existing federated learning methods have many limitations that restrict the further applications in large practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a set of federated data methods to transfer training features, which eventually not only keep the convenience and effectiveness of ASR training by nature but also protect the speaker's personal information.},

Accordingly, «tokenization» refers to the concept of creating a singular identifier on a distributed ledger in terms of a token that may represent anything from financial assets, goods, to other valuable resources. Where tokenization may disrupt our economic system leading to more efficiency or democracy, it is required to gain insights and facilitate the development of use cases associated with this concept. To illustrate how firms can apply tokenization to innovate their businesses, we propose a framework of different token properties, drivers, and barriers for adoption based on literature and expert interviews and present eight archetypical cases derived from an analysis of 129 ventures. This work provides strategic guidance in a token economy and a starting point for future research of viable applications.},

By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.},

Not only could new technologies create the need for different goods and services; they could also take over repetitive, physically demanding, and dangerous work. This would allow people to dedicate their time to other endeavors, such as pursuing their interests and doing things that are meaningful to them. Leadership principles will be much affected by the development of future HMI. Technological development can lead to significant increases in productivity, but it will depend on how these gains are distributed between economic and social groups. Even in the year 2030, people will still be superior to machines and use them as tools, not the other way around. Therefore, the tools will develop depending on the goals of the people. If they are aimed at enforcing the superiority of the respective system, the relationship between man and machine in both countries will show considerable differences and will no longer be compatible, but even contrary to each other.},

The proposed approach can be used for providing multi-level security in various applications such as military, copyright protection, and telemedicine systems. The key idea of the projected approach is to first combine two digital watermark images into a single fused watermark to increase the embedded information payload. Then, the fused watermark is scrambled using Arnold and Chaotic algorithms. Finally, the scrambled fused watermark is embedded in the cover image using the SVD and three-level DWT algorithms. The selection of the Arnold and chaotic for watermark encryption is attributed to confirm robustness which resists several types of multimedia attacks and upturn the security level. This paper also presents a comparative study of the proposed approach for different digital images to determine its robustness and stability. Several simulation results reveal that the proposed system improves the capacity and security of embedded medical watermarks without affecting the cover image quality. In conclusion, the proposed approach achieved not only precise acceptable perceptual quality with admired Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values but similarly high Correlation Coefficient (Cr) and SSIM values in the existence of severe attacks.},

The goal of this research is to describe the technologies that are enablers of I4, analyze the human talent needed and the qualifications (competencies/skills) required to manage I4 systems, describe the courses and practices that leading universities in engineering and technology are teaching for developing the I4 workforce, and provide a look to the future by presenting trends related to education in I4. Autonomous robots, simulation, horizontal and vertical integration, the Industrial Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, cybersecurity, the cloud, and Big Data and analytics are technologies considered pillars of the I4 approach. Nowadays, there are universities already offering programs related to I4. These range from those aimed at presenting the concepts of I4 to those in which students learn how to handle related technologies in real work in global enterprises. I4 is still evolving, and we present only a glimpse of what is required based on its current state. Continuous review of the I4 environment is necessary to determine opportunely the path that it will follow and, in consequence, the needs that will emerge in areas such as curricula content, competency requirements, and technologies.},

  abstract       = {Robot control software endows robots with advanced capabilities for autonomous operation, such as navigation, object recognition or manipulation, in unstructured and dynamic environments. However, there is a steady need for more robust operation, where robots should perform complex tasks by reliably exploiting these novel capabilities. Mission-level resilience is required in the presence of component faults through failure recovery. To address this challenge, a novel self-adaptation framework based on functional knowledge for augmented autonomy is presented. A metacontroller is integrated on top of the robot control system, and it uses an explicit run-time model of the robot’s controller and its mission to adapt to operational changes. The model is grounded on a functional ontology that relates the robot’s mission with the robot’s architecture, and it is generated during the robot’s development from its engineering models. Advantages are discussed from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. An application example in a real autonomous mobile robot is provided. In this example, the generic metacontroller uses the robot’s functional model to adapt the control architecture to recover from a sensor failure.},

In the context of the Industry 4.0 initiative, Cyber-Physical ProductionSystems (CPPS) or Cyber Manufacturing Systems (CMS) can be characterized asadvanced networked mechatronic production systems gaining their added valueby interaction with the ambient Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In thiscontext appropriate communication technologies and standards play a vitalrole to realize the manifold potential improvements in the productionprocess. One of these standards is IO-Link. In 2016 more than 5 millionIO-Link nodes have been produced and delivered, still gaining increasingacceptance for the communication between sensors, actuators and the controllevel. The steadily increasing demand for more flexibility in automationsolutions can be fulfilled using wireless technologies. With the wirelessextension for the IO-Link standard, which will be presented in this article,maximum cycle times of 5 ms can be achieved with a probability that this limitwill be exceeded to be at maximum one part per billion. Also roaming capabilities, wirelesscoexistence mechanisms and the possibility to include battery-powered orenergy-harvesting sensors with very limited energy resources in the realtimenetwork were defined. For system planning, setup, operation and maintenance,the standard engineering tools of IO-Link can be employed so that thebackward compatibility with wired IO-Link solutions can be guaranteed.Interoperability between manufacturers is a key requirement for anycommunication standard, thus a procedure for IO-Link Wireless testing is alsosuggested.},

  abstract       = {Aircraft spare parts inventory management (ASPM) has played a critical role in tracing and tracking spare parts as any related maintenance or movement shall be recorded. Traceability and trackability of data ensure the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part’s life cycle, leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.},

  abstract       = {Background: The vision of a fourth industrial revolution lately strongly captured the attention of research A Cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the main drivers of this vision. Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions.Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results. Our findings highlight areas for future research and provide suggestions for investigation approaches.},

  abstract       = {The business world is continually changing. Dynamic environments, full of uncertainties, complexities, and ambiguities, demand faster and more confident decisions. To compete in this environment, Industry 4.0 emerges as an essential alternative. In this context, the reliability of manufacturing is an essential aspect for companies to make successful decisions. In the literature, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been applied to improve the availability of equipment, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), blockchain, and data mining. Nevertheless, there is still no survey study that seeks to show how reliability has collaborated to support decision-making in organizations, in the context of Industry 4.0. In general, most applications still focus on the productivity and health of individual equipment. However, in today's volatile and complex businesses, local decisions are no longer sufficient; it is necessary to analyze the organization entirely. Thus, being aware of the impacts that a local failure can impose on the entire company has significant weight in the decision-making process. In this context, this article presents a survey to identify how researches on systems reliability has contributed to and supported the development of decision-making in Industry 4.0. The main contribution of this article is to highlight how reliability can be used to support different types of strategic decisions in the context of Industry 4.0. Finally, it highlights the need for research associating management decisions with the technologies of Industry 4.0.},

While IT technology offers a variety of technological advances, plant owners strive for stability and robustness of the production process. To overcome this tension field, we propose a set of 16 requirements for the development of industrial AI solutions to foster i) the adaptation process, ii) support the solution engineering and iii) ease the embedding into the existing system landscape while respecting iv) safety aspects to build up v) trust into industrial AI solutions. The proposed requirements can guide industrial stakeholders to focus on the right solution approach for specific production challenges and support them in voicing their own needs towards novel AI solutions. This will help AI developers to speed up time-to-market as well as to increase market acceptance of industrial AI solutions. Overall, specifying requirements on industrial AI will foster the acceptance and utilization rates of AI solutions in industrial practice.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {The manufacturing industry requires intra- and inter-organizational collaboration to cope with increasing cost pressure, high market dynamics, and sophisticated customer requirements. Therefore, many solutions emerged in recent years that enable the sharing or trading of production capacities in different industries. These solutions are based on a centralized platform. The business model of those platforms introduces transaction costs for users. Additionally, these platforms often create lasting dependencies, lack transparency, and therefore trust. At the same time, new technologies such as blockchain emerged, which promise to solve these various issues by enabling decentralized transactions. This paper uses a design science research approach to develop an infrastructure for decentralized collaborative manufacturing. Therefore, we matched requirements for existing platform approaches to decentralizing technologies. To evaluate the approach, we conducted expert interviews to verify the usefulness and assess potential improvements to extend existing research dimensions of collaboration systems.},

Grounded on extensive empirical evidence from a typical and revelatory case study at a global leader for mechatronic assemblies, this exploratory paper identifies, visualizes, and discusses challenges in product lifecycle management in the automotive supply industry. With the limitation of an exploratory and interpretive single-case study approach, we (1) supply scholars and practitioners with grounded, stakeholder-related insights and (2) link the field of product lifecycle management with information systems.},

  abstract       = {Background-Photo-realistic terapixel visualization is computationally intensive and to date there have been no such visualizations of urban digital twins, the few terapixel visualizations that exist have looked towards space rather than earth. Objective-our aims are: creating a scalable cloud supercomputer software architecture for visualization; a photo-realistic terapixel 3D visualization of urban IoT data supporting daily updates; a rigorous evaluation of cloud supercomputing for our application. Method-We migrated the Blender Cycles path tracer to the public cloud within a new software framework designed to scale to petaFLOP performance. Results-we demonstrate we can compute a terapixel visualization in under one hour, the system scaling at 98% efficiency to use 1024 public cloud GPU nodes delivering 14 petaFLOPS. The resulting terapixel image supports interactive browsing of the city and its data at a wide range of sensing scales. Conclusion-The GPU compute resource available in the cloud is greater than anything available on our national supercomputers providing access to globally competitive resources. The direct financial cost of access, compared to procuring and running these systems, was low. The indirect cost, in overcoming teething issues with cloud software development, should reduce significantly over time.},

Although this can be considered a success for the computer graphics community, it has given rise to complex forensic and legal issues. A compelling example comes from the need to distinguish between computer-generated and photographic images as it pertains to the legality and prosecution of child pornography in the United States. We performed psychophysical experiments to determine the accuracy with which observers are capable of distinguishing computer-generated from photographic images. We find that observers have considerable difficulty performing this task—more difficulty than we observed 5 years ago when computer-generated imagery was not as photorealistic. We also find that observers are more likely to report that an image is photographic rather than computer generated, and that resolution has surprisingly little effect on performance. Finally, we find that a small amount of training greatly improves accuracy.},

The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration. In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence.},

Not surprisingly, our results show that DIUs primarily focus on digital products and business models related to AI, IoT/Smart x and Data Analytics. Differentiating between four DIU setups, we could not find particular digital trends being addressed by specific setups. In addition, drawing on the Gartner Hype Cycle (GHC), we show that DIUs mostly pay attention to digital trends in more mature stages. We conclude and recommend the need for DIUs to focus on radical DIs to be as innovative as they should be and to pay attention on digital trends in the earlier stages of the GHC to promote radical DIs.},

The article analyzes the vulnerability of the production line with implemented industrial IoT devices with consideration of a possible Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attack led by attackers from the internet. Various types of DDoS attacks abusing the presence of IoT devices in the system were performed on an automated production line implementing sorting, preparation, and dosing of bulk and liquid materials for filling into containers. The leading attacks caused failure of the production line during the production, as well as the dysfunction of communication with IoT devices.

Its typical feature is transmission of information in the system environment provided by the Internet of Things. All information should be stored and shared through cloud computing. As a result, access to information should be unrestricted. This chapter is focused on Computational Intelligence (CI) in the context of Industry 4.0. Each subchapter provides fundamentals of some paradigms, followed by the use of CI in the concrete paradigm. The ending part of the chapter is focused on connecting theory and practice in a case study, which lists industrial parts recognition by convolutional neural networks for assisted assembly.},

  abstract       = {Smart inverters connected to a communication network are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, a self-security approach is implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. The digital twin is formed using the inverter’s normal operating region and the inverter’s dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates how the inverter’s normal operating region and dynamic model are formed. In particular, the normal operation region is experimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 1.5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter and a 12-kW NHR 9410 regenerative power grid emulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique can potentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks by examining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter’s digital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

Impacts The changes allow for a formal separation between policy and regulation, and commercial and operational matters. The new energy minister was involved in setting current output OPEC-plus targets, and will be under pressure to seek further cuts. The choice of Yasir al-Rumayyan, an investment adviser to the crown prince, as Aramco chairman is a signal of commitment to pursue the IPO.

The growing data produced to support the development and the exploitation of these products, requires them to go within a Product Lifecycle Management or to modify it to take into account new needs. Most of time this leads to use disruptive technologies and innovative mindsets in order to well align tool market capabilities to industry businesses. The approach presented in this paper contributes to identify the product lifecycle management as an end-product composed of several compounds which can be managed within a system engineering process. The system engineering framework is used to propose a comprehensive picture of the operational, functional and structural breakdown need for the Product Lifecycle Management deployment.},

Often linked to the smart city movement, it provides a way of sensing and collecting data—environmental, societal, and transitional—both automatically, remotely, and with increasing levels of spatial and temporal detail. From city-wide data collection down to the scale of individual buildings and rooms, this chapter details the technology behind the rise of IoT in urban areas and explores the challenges (societal and technical) behind city-wide deployments. Drawing from a series of deployments at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, it details the challenges and opportunities for mass data collection. Widening out the view, it looks at what is becoming known as “the humble lamp post in Urban IoT fields to detail the potential of Urban IoT with the objects that already form part of the urban fabric. Finally, it examines the potential of Urban IoT for input into urban modeling and how we are on the edge of a shift in the collection, analysis, and communication of urban data.},

The fundamental threat to this progress is the inherent increase of complexity through heterogeneous systems, software, and hardware that leads to fragility and unreliability. Systems cannot only become more unreliable, modern industrial control systems also have to face hostile security attacks that take advantage of unintended vulnerabilities overseen during development and deployment. Self-adaptive software systems offer means of dealing with complexity by observing systems externally. In this chapter the authors present their ongoing research on an approach that applies a self-adaptive software system in order to increase the reliability and security of control devices for hydro-power plant units. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by two use cases. Further, the chapter gives an introduction to the field of self-adaptive software systems and raises research challenges in the context of cyber-physical systems.},

To address this problem, researchers are developing cutting-edge technologies for the envisioned 6G wireless communication standards to satisfy the escalating wireless services demands. Though some of the candidate technologies in the 5G standards will apply to 6G wireless networks, key disruptive technologies that will guarantee the desired quality of physical experience to achieve ubiquitous wireless connectivity are expected in 6G. This article first provides a foundational background on the evolution of different wireless communication standards to have a proper insight into the vision and requirements of 6G. Second, we provide a panoramic view of the enabling technologies proposed to facilitate 6G and introduce emerging 6G applications such as multi-sensory–extended reality, digital replica, and more. Next, the technology-driven challenges, social, psychological, health and commercialization issues posed to actualizing 6G, and the probable solutions to tackle these challenges are discussed extensively. Additionally, we present new use cases of the 6G technology in agriculture, education, media and entertainment, logistics and transportation, and tourism. Furthermore, we discuss the multi-faceted communication capabilities of 6G that will contribute significantly to global sustainability and how 6G will bring about a dramatic change in the business arena. Finally, we highlight the research trends, open research issues, and key take-away lessons for future research exploration in 6G wireless communication.},

  abstract       = {Digitization era is altering several industries which include the way in which the data is analyzed and it is inferred that about 2.7 Zettabytes of data exist in the digital world today. By 2020 the data generated per second for every human being will approximate amount to 1.7 megabytes and the volume of data would double every 2 years thus reach the 40 ZB point by 2020. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by the end of year 2020, the e-commerce transactions B2B and B2C will hit 450 billion per day on the internet. The advent of Big and real time Data has triggered disruptive changes in many fields and the exploding volume of different sources of data like heterogeneous data, data integration, spatio-temporal correlation of data, batch analytics and real-time analytics, data sharing, semantic interoperability requires the development of a scalable platform that can fuse multiple data layers to handles the data intelligently. In Big Data approaches, the challenge is not anymore to collect the data, but to draw valuable conclusions by properly analyzing them. The growth in Unstructured Data generated by business is irrefutable and they are under more pressure to preserve it for longer periods of time. To be clear, exploiting the collected data has been always considered by practitioners and researchers, but the huge velocity, heterogeneity and enormity of massive stream of real-time data shove the limits of the current storage, management and processing capabilities. Admittedly, the traditional method of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) are challenged and cannot be applied on the emerging opportunistically and crowed sensed data streams. Some of these data streams are structured in a way that serve only one predefined purpose and cannot be directly used for other means. Yet, there are emerging unstructured data such as context-based data from the internet and social media as well as credit card transactions that is not clear if they can be used to better understand the mobility patterns. The analytical company Gartner states that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion interconnected devices. It is obvious, that they will produce massive amounts of meaningful data. Those data can be used for many applications such as real-time industrial equipment monitoring, traffic planning, automated maintenance, etc. Therefore, it is essential to develop modern system abstractions that allow us to resourcefully process huge and new data streams. This enormous amount of data urges the growth of integrated and insightful big and real-time data analytics Platforms. The upcoming contemporary technology like digital twin, integrates historical data from past machine usage to the current data. It uses sensors to collect the real-time data, working status and other operational data attached to the physical model. These components send the relevant data via a cloud-based system to the other side of the bridge with the help of data analytics platform which produces the required insights. The big and real-time data analytics Platforms assist to perform useful operations on data analytics as a complete package. For this purpose, data analytics platform are used to acquire constructive insight from the huge volume of data. Data analytics platform is an ecosystem of technologies and services that can help the businesses in increasing revenues, enhance operational efficiency, stabilize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts, respondmore quickly toemerging market trends and gain a competitive edge over rivals. The data analytics platform finds the pattern and relationships in data by applying statistical techniques and communicates the results generated by analytical models to executives and end users to make decisions with the help of data visualization tools that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real time as new information becomes available. Big data and real-time data analytics platform supports the full spectrum of data types, protocols and integration to speed up and simplify the data wrangling process. The big data and real time platform provides accurate data, increase efficiency in the workspace, gives answers to complex questions along with security and hence it plays the key role in business analytics.},

  abstract       = {Digitalization has become a widely used term both in professional language and in scientific literature. It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.},

  abstract    = {A systems-of-systems (SoS) is a class of systems characterized by the collaboration among independent constituent systems, each one with its own purposes and functionalities and interacting with the others aiming to meet common global missions. An essential characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.},

This article deals with industrial CPS, which we define as CPS concepts applied to the process and manufacturing industries. Originating from traditional control systems, the industry is already since a number of years undergoing a major shift toward more connected systems, also reflected in various national initiatives such as Industrie 4.0 in Germany, Smart Manufacturing in the USA, and Intelligent Manufacturing in China. We first give a brief historic perspective on the industrial automation systems and how that is currently evolving into more general CPS. Then some ongoing trends and future challenges are discussed. This includes the shift toward more autonomous systems and challenges such as analysis of CPS including modelling and cyber-physical security.},

  abstract       = {Significant differences exist between pavement and building structures, particularly with respect to the type and mode of loading conditions: structural elements, beams and columns of buildings are subjected to static loads and pavement to dynamic loads. However, the design of structural members for buildings might need to address temporary dynamic loads due to wind, earthquake or other factors depending on building or structure height and application. In contrast, pavements are subjected to the moving loads of vehicles as well as to further loads due to temperature gradients. Since the layers of various materials used in pavements may vary in thickness and the statically indeterminate nature of pavement (due to the full contact with the bed soil layer or the lower layers), any deformation caused by changes in the moisture content and temperature can result in internal stresses in pavement structures. Consequently, analysis of pavement structures can be very complicated, requiring skills in material characterization, mathematics and modeling. In this regard, a useful book that covers various subjects in the pavement design and analysis was reviewed. Th details of each chapter were briefly explained. This book is recommended for consultant engineers and pavement researchers.},

It is with growing urgency that the philosophers’ advice and guidance for taking the time to ask the “right questions. Value creating boards need to evolve to become problematizing bodies where decision-making is not under time pressure and the protection of power. Rather than clinging to the fantasy of complete transparency as the only form of accountability, corporate governance is strengthened in this way by practicing true social responsibility, which emerges not from outward-looking compliance but from a deeper place in the corporate psyche through inward-looking contemplation and the development of moral maturity.},

This systematic and thematic review provides a detailed analysis of I4.0-related requirements in terms of MES functionalities and an overview of MES development methods and standards because these three aspects are essential in developing MESs. The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development. The observed trends show that formal models and ontologies will play an even more essential role in I4.0 systems as interoperability becomes more of a focus and that the new generation of linkable data sources should be based on semantically enriched information. The presented overview can serve as a guide for engineers interested in the development of MESs as well as for researchers interested in finding worthwhile areas of research.},

A smart production unit can be thought of as a powerful connected industrial system with materials, parts, equipment, tools, inventory, and logistics that can transmit data and communicate with one another in the age of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This IIoT refers to linked devices, sensors, and other equipment that may be networked in the industrial environment to provide remote access, effective monitoring, better data collecting, analysis, & exchange etc. In Industry 4.0, IIoT is fundamental to transforming cyber-physical systems and production processes through big data and analytics. This paper provides an overview of the IIoT and the technologies that underpin it. The primary benefits and features of IIoT in manufacturing are discussed in detail. Smart Transformations made into the manufacturing field through IIoT Culture are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, twenty-nine significant applications of IIoT in the field of manufacturing are identified and discussed. IIoT can monitor the transport, supply of the goods, consult details on things in warehouses, and check the conditions related to product storage and delivery and allow all dispersed and outsourced operations to be monitored. Therefore, the industry is being revolutionised by IIoT, altering the way industrial enterprises function daily to improve efficiency and performance levels.},

However, there exists limited understanding about the design of DTs in production logistics. Addressing this issue, this study proposes a process for the design of DTs in production logistics. This study extends related works describing the dimensions of DTs in manufacturing, and adopts a process perspective based on production development literature. The results present a process for the design of DTs including activities in pre-study, conceptual, and detailed design phases corresponding to five DT dimensions. The proposed process is validated during the development of a DT in a production logistics lab at an academic environment. The findings of this study may be essential for avoiding misplaced resources and lost opportunities in the design of DTs in production logistics, and facilitating the planning and resource allocation.},

  abstract       = {In the recent years, the topic of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has attracted a large number of academic researchers and industry practitioners. IIoT connects the actors, and the physical and cyber resources of industrial systems, manufacturing- or service-based, in a cloud-enabled overall data exchange system. This work outlines a formal model for operational scheduling of cyber-physical resources for different scenarios determined by resource and logistics availability and cost. Information exchange of physical work-in-process, resource failures, alternative resource options, order and logistics information, are used to deliver real-time scheduling to IIoT participants. The model is formalized using discrete state-machine diagrams for resource reliability and availability status, and logistics timing purposes. Low-performance solution invariants are generated and validated through functional requirements test case building. The data exchange network between the processing nodes of the IIoT environment is built on a software-defined network foundation. A simulation is then built for a series of work-in-process orders and their required processing operations, several manufacturing enterprises and associated physical logistics, and the cloud IIoT network cyber infrastructure for data and control information sharing. Both the formalized and the simulation models are run in the IIoT cloud and can be accessed by the participating enterprises. The formalized model provides insights on resource repair or replacement options, part transfer decisions, while the simulation model builds on those decisions and runs only validated scenarios anchored in timing- and cost-based constraints.},

Along with the traditional problems of ensuring nuclear and technological safety during the decommissioning of NPPs, new challenges have arisen related to ensuring cybersecurity. In accordance with the recommendations of regulatory documents, it is necessary to identify critical information assets at the design stage. The paper notes the need to create digital twins to develop technologies for decommissioning an object while ensuring its safety of all types. The paper discusses the areas of application of remote-control technologies and robotics during the decommissioning of nuclear power plants, and also highlights some of the problems of these technologies. The necessity of maintaining a knowledge base on the object, remote control of robots used for inspection and dismantling of the object, the use of artificial intelligence, ensuring cybersecurity, and the designing of digital twins is emphasized for the successful solution of the decommissioning problem.},

We can rely on the ISA-95 architecture or the 5C architecture to build the cyber-physical system for smart factories. However, both architectures emphasize more on vertical integration and less on horizontal integration. This article proposes the 8C architecture by adding 3C facets into the 5C architecture. The 3C facets are coalition, customer, and content. The proposed 8C architecture is a helpful guideline to build the cyber-physical system for smart factories. We show an example of designing and developing, on the basis of the proposed 8C architecture, a smart factory cyber-physical system, including an Industrial Internet of Things gateway and a smart factory data center running in the cloud environment.},

However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of digital twin in IoT. In this paper, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through access point (AP) to help resource limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.},

  abstract       = {Cyber-Physical Systems and Digital Twins are commonly used today in the industrial sector, and the healthcare sector is keen to implement these technological solutions to enhance their capabilities and offer better services for patient care provision. In fact, the adoption of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) based on IoT along with cloud computing systems has led to the development of new methodologies to monitor and treat patients. However, the adoption of the new technologies comes with several challenges in terms of performance and security. Considering that, WBAN can be wearable or implanted under the skin, and the overall concept leads to several cybersecurity challenges that would require deeper investigation. This chapter presents an analysis of the impact that WBAN has on health care. It also provides some definitions of Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPSs) and Digital Twins along with technological enablers such as cloud and IoT.},

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only influenced both day-to-day functions of firms dramatically, but also their efforts to become more digitally mature. In this review paper, we discuss the barriers to DT before, during, and what may well continue after the COVID-19 pandemic and offer a new strategy discipline—Strategic Doing—that may be useful to manufacturing firms in achieving successful DT. We discuss the divergent definitions and drivers of DT diving deep into the barriers for manufacturing firms to mature digitally. We briefly describe digital readiness and current efforts of DT in manufacturing while describing the impact of COVID-19 on DT initiatives. We conclude by describing Strategic Doing and suggesting new paths for research in this area.},

  abstract       = {This chapter reflects on the current state and provides future directions of the growing field of food engineering across the food chain, from on-farm postharvest and sustainable processing to nutrient delivery in the body for sustained or improved health. Key learnings from the International Congress on Engineering and Food, ICEF13, held in Melbourne, Australia, in September 2019, are highlighted. Some of the food systems and innovation trends conveyed in keynote talks, oral presentations, and e-posters summarized here are detailed in the chapters of this book and in special issues of two reference food engineering journals. A global overview of biosystems engineering solutions for developed and developing countries includes alternative protein sources, postharvest engineering for food waste transformation and sustainability. Then, advances in food processing technologies including refrigeration, freezing, thermal and nonthermal processing, and drying are discussed. An update on the innovative use of technologies such as extrusion for alternative ingredient production and innovative texturization, 3D food printing for personalized structuring and nutrition, pulsed electric field or hydrostatic pressure for structuring, as well as precision fermentation and other methods for bioactive incorporation is provided. The chapter also covers advances in ecofriendly antimicrobial and intelligent packaging with in-built micro- and nanosensors. Other sensor technologies integrated into digital manufacturing using Industry 4.0 are presented in the context of the food supply chain. Engineers are increasingly involved in consumer health research by creating more representative in vitro mimetics of human oral processing and digestion devices that are coupled with nutrient delivery models. The chapter concludes with suggestions to modify the food engineering curricula to (a) prepare food engineers of the future for global challenges appearing in both developing and developed countries, and (b) develop broader technical, interpersonal, and integrated regional and global supply chain skills. Food engineering will continue to play an important role in the development of cutting-edge smart processes that transform and personalize foods targeting individual nourishment and improved body function via controlled delivery strategies. Therefore, food engineering is broadening the scope beyond conventional unit operations and process design and optimization, to include environmental assessments, bioprocesses in the human body, and digital tools to identify circular and cost-effective solutions, and develop sustainable food systems.},

Through digitalization, societies aim to streamline their key functions and to develop modern services to inhabitants. 5G wireless networks are being built globally with lots of expectations put on them. It is anticipated that at the first phase of 5G, the technology will benefit the most different verticals like factories, hospitals and campuses. Universities have likewise awoken to establish digitalization projects to respond to the disruption of education and to overcome in the growing global competition. The transition to digital campus will inevitably rely on campus ICT and IoT infrastructures. Additionally, the number of terminals, devices, sensors and robots will multiply. This article proposes a technical architecture for future Smart Campus consisting of 5G and IoT networks complemented by distributed computing and data analytics. Increasing complexity of digital environment calls for a specific actor to operate the Smart Campus infrastructure and also services, which has not been widely discussed. It is foreseen that the university IT Administration is probably not willing to adopt the responsibility of enlarging infra and growing number of devices. Similarly, mobile network operators are not seen appropriate to take this role being commonly profiled to offer merely connectivity. To tackle this question, a novel operational model for the Smart Campuses is presented based on the recently proposed micro operator concept. Moreover, a case study of the University of Oulu campus is presented, where smart technology in the form of 5G test network has been deployed.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies are rapidly fueling data and software solutions driven digitalization in many fields notably in industrial automation and manufacturing systems. Among the several benefits offered by these technologies, is the infrastructure for harnessing big-data, machine learning (ML) and cloud computing software tools, for instance in designing advanced data analytics platforms. Although, this is an area of increased interest, the information concerning the implementation of data analytics in the context of Industry4.0 is scarcely available in scientific literature. Therefore, this work presents a process data analytics platform built around the concept of industry 4.0. The platform utilizes the state-of-the-art IIoT platforms, ML algorithms and big-data software tools. The platform emphasizes the use of ML methods for process data analytics while leveraging big-data processing tools and taking advantage of the currently available industrial grade cloud computing platforms. The industrial applicability of the platform was demonstrated by the development of soft sensors for use in a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. In the case study, the work studied data-driven soft sensors to predict syngas heating value and hot flue gas temperature. Among the studied data-driven methods, the neural network-based NARX model demonstrated better performance in the prediction of both syngas heating value and flue gas temperature. The modeling results showed that, in cases where process knowledge about the process phenomena at hand is limited, data-driven soft sensors are useful tools for predictive data analytics.},

  volume         = {103},
  abstract       = {The high consumption of natural resources and their scarcity made sustainability a buzzword and one of the main concerns of society. Based on current research, Lean production and Industry 4.0 strategies are promising in this regard. They argue to offer cost and time efficiency, labor productivity increase, and other benefits. In the literature, there are works on separate effects of Lean and Industry 4.0 on Sustainability, as well as high compatibility between Industry 4.0 and Lean, where one strategy comprehends the use of another. Only a few articles consider the integrated effect and mostly lack empirical validation. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on both separate and integrated effects of Lean and Industry 4.0 (Lean 4.0) on three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social). Additionally, several sustainability indicators as differentiation factors are formed and presented as a checklist to assess the effect of Lean and Industry 4.0 concepts. The findings reveal that Lean and Industry 4.0 has a somewhat uncertain or twofold correlation with sustainability, where Lean 4.0 has a strong positive correlation. The results of the study can be used by researchers for another large-scale research that empirically validates the developed hypothesis and by managers in the strategy development and decision-making processes.

  abstract       = {With buildings around the world accounting for nearly one-third of global energy demand and the availability of fossil fuels constantly on the decline, there is a need to ensure that this energy demand is efficiently and effectively managed using renewable energy now more than ever. Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of ‘new’ buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for ‘existing’ buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period.},

Self-organizing networks, WSN, m2m networks, IIoT, mesh networks are faced with the cyberthreats of specific character: dynamic routing failures, node isolation, DDoS attacks, traffic lack, etc. Most of them are caused by cybersecurity weaknesses: the software vulnerabilities and architectural features of dynamically reconfigured network. The existing methods of binary code analysis and intrusion detection can work with a small number of data sets, are designed for either code inspection or network checking, and are targeted for static networks with regular topology. The proposed neural model demonstrates an universal approach that deals with the cybersecurity weakness as a systems genuine property and attempts to approximate it using a hybrid deep ANN. The new ANN detects both the network security defects and binary code vulnerabilities at once with high accuracy (more than 0.97). It also shows good performance capacity processing big data of the undercontrolled network.},

  abstract       = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have induced tremendous growth in innovation and automation. Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack , which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary’s actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 and its other synonyms like Smart Manufacturing, Smart Production or Internet of Things, have been identified as major contributors in the context of digital and automated manufacturing environment. The term industry 4.0 comprises a variety of technologies to enable the development of the value chain resulting in reduced manufacturing lead times, and improved product quality and organizational performance. Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes. Finally, the scope of future research is discussed in detail.},

This paper is the first of its kind to pull together research on both—the pandemic-related challenges and the management interventions in a manufacturing context. This systematic literature review reveals the frailty of supply chains and production networks in withstanding the pressures of lockdowns and other safety protocols, including product and workforce shortages. These, altogether, have led to closed facilities, reduced capacities, increased costs, and severe economic uncertainty for manufacturing businesses. In managing these challenges and stabilising their operations, manufacturers are urgently intervening by—investing in digital technologies, undertaking resource redistribution and repurposing, regionalizing and localizing, servitizing, and targeting policies that can help them survive in this altered economy. Based on holistic analysis of these challenges and interventions, this review proposes an extensive research agenda for future studies to pursue.},

These technologies are enabling Interoperability and integration of various processes and departments in an organization because of the attribute of real-time inter-connectivity. Due to high inter-connectivity advantages like shorter development time, mass customization and modularity, configurability can be brought into existence. This will not only change the dynamics of the production lines but also add to the profit ratio of an organization by controlling over inventory via virtualization and predictive manufacturing. Due to such attributes of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, understanding them in depth is necessary. Hence, this paper aims to review many such characteristics, enablers, and main drivers of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and ultimately provides insight on the future scopes of each of the main pillars of Industry 4.0.},

To reduce energy consumption, manufacturing operations need to develop energy efficient techniques. This development will also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and production costs. The aim of this research is to create a simulation methodology and to investigate the modelling of thermal and energy management (called e-ProMan) across manufacturing site. Using simulation, the ‘e-ProMan’ system generates a real-time, virtual and user-friendly factory model. A ‘Big Data’ approach is taken in which a large set of data are acquired from both inside and outside the factory in order to analyse the correlation between work flow, data flow and energy flow to provide real-time decision making. In particular, four data sources are gathered including weather forecast, temperature and humidity sensors, machine energy consumption and production process and scheduling. The ‘e-ProMan’ system is specifically designed to suit manufacturing operations of small and medium sizes to complement limited budget and lower resources especially in data gathering infrastructures.},

The IIoT forms the backbone for materializing the Industry 4.0 initiative. Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance. Intelligence refers to making optimal decisions for both automated and human-in-the-loop decision making. Condition-based predictive maintenance (CBPdM), also known as Maintenance 4.0, is among the major focus points of the Industry 4.0 and IIoT. In this paper, we discuss the existing standards related to condition-based maintenance and the potential of the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE), a MIMOSA led initiative, as a framework which extends previous open standards for achieving CBPdM. We illustrate how the framework addresses the requirements of Industry 4.0 and CBPdM.},

Consequently, for new projects aiming at reusing one of these ontologies, the process of evaluating them has become more and more time consuming and cumbersome. We evaluated eight well known ontologies for measurement units and the relevant parts of the Wikidata corpus. We automatically collected descriptive statistics about the ontologies and scanned them for potential errors, using an extensible collection of scripts. The computational results were manually reviewed, which uncovered several issues and misconceptions in the examined ontologies. The issues were reported to the ontology authors. This caused new bugfix releases in three cases. In this paper we will present the evaluation results including statistics as well as an overview of detected issues. We thereby want to enable a well-founded decision upon the unit ontology to use. Further, we hope to prevent errors in the future by describing some pitfalls in ontology development – not limited to the domain of measurement units.},

Inspired by the frameworks developed to support exploration and realisation of I4.0 technologies for disassembly, the paper discusses the same emerging technologies in the wider context of remanufacturing. Trends and gaps have been identified from a value-creation perspective that encompasses the product to be remanufactured, the remanufacturing equipment and processes adopted and related organisation issues. Findings suggest there is a need to explore the connection of cyber-physical systems to the IoT to support smart remanufacturing, whilst aligning with evolving information and communication infrastructures and circular economy business models. The review highlights twenty-nine research topics that require attention to support this field.},

This contribution describes after an introduction of the new concepts the needs for future PAT systems and its relevance to the data scientists. A description of fundamental limitations of the spectroscopic sensors and a critical assessment of common mistakes as well as sources of perturbations should increase the interdisciplinary cooperation between the data analytic specialists and spectroscopists.},

  abstract       = {Both practitioners and scholars emphasise the benefits of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technology implementation, such as increased transparency and the availability of real-time data in operations processes. Current literature on I4.0 technologies tends to overemphasise the positive impact and transformational capabilities of digital technologies while there is little focus on evaluating potential risks associated with their adoption in industrial operations. An understanding of how supply chain risks are perceived in digitalisation projects within industrial operations and an understanding of decision-makers' responses to different types of risks has important managerial implications. Current literature, however, lacks systematic empirical evidence on the implementation of I4.0 applications and related risk factors. This study aims to address this research gap by exploring the relationship between I4.0 technologies and supply chain risks based on empirical evidence from 300 case studies of industrial practice in Germany and fifty-three interviews with relevant managers from selected use cases and with general experts in this field. Our findings show that digital technologies are frequently adopted to address certain existing supply chain risks but that their implementation introduces new sources of risks (e.g. cyber risks). Based on qualitative data analysis and drawing on Normal Accident Theory, we propose a framework to explicate the drivers and contingency factors of new sources of supply chain risks in the context of Industry 4.0 technologies. Practical recommendations are provided for supply chain managers to guide the process of managing supply chain risks based on the technological life cycle.},

Warehouses are challenged to reassess its order fulfillment operations while simultaneously being provided with the opportunity to develop its own cloud-based CPS with the aid of IoT devices. Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is a system controlling mobile robots, mobile storage rack, putaway and picking workstations, charging stations, and wireless communication infrastructure in the context of robotic-assisted warehouse. This paper addresses the value creation utilizing cloud-based CPS in RMFS. By providing an analysis of cloud services and IoT enhancement, theoretical concepts from the literatures are consolidated to solve the research que-stions on how RMFS offering better order fulfillment can gain benefits in terms of operational efficiency and system reliability. The paper also proposes a cloud-based CPS architecture, providing a comprehensive understanding on conflict avoidance strategy in the multi-layers multi-deeps warehouse layout. This research presents six conflict classifications in RMFS and provides a case study in the real-life context. Dock grid conflict is a new type of conflict appearing in multi-deeps RMFS. A scenario analysis with real customer orders is applied to present the collision detection and solution.},

  abstract       = {The development of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promotes the integration of the cross-platform systems in fog computing, which enable users to obtain access to multiple application located in different geographical locations. Fog users at the network’s edge communicate with many fog servers in different fogs and newly joined servers that they had never contacted before. This communication complexity brings enormous security challenges and potential vulnerability to malicious threats. The attacker may replace the edge device with a fake one and authenticate it as a legitimate device. Therefore, to prevent unauthorized users from accessing fog servers, we propose a new secure and lightweight multi-factor authentication scheme for cross-platform IoT systems (SELAMAT). The proposed scheme extends the Kerberos workflow and utilizes the AES-ECC algorithm for efficient encryption keys management and secure communication between the edge nodes and fog node servers to establish secure mutual authentication. The scheme was tested for its security analysis using the formal security verification under the widely accepted AVISPA tool. We proved our scheme using Burrows Abdi Needham’s logic (BAN logic) to prove secure mutual authentication. The results show that the SELAMAT scheme provides better security, functionality, communication, and computation cost than the existing schemes.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 has been identified as a major contributor to the era of digitalisation. Its implications for sustainable development have gained widespread attention from the perspectives of the triple bottom line, sustainable business models and circular economy. The purpose of this paper is to map the broad field of sustainable development and investigate the key research areas which comprises the aforementioned perspectives under Industry 4.0 framework. A systematic mapping review was conducted by searching five databases for relevant literature published between January 1, 2012 and April 17, 2020. The search yielded 4291 papers of which 81 were identified as primary papers relevant to the research herein. The primary findings are that the majority of sustainability research focuses on conceptual analysis, and the Internet of Things is dominantly cited with an emphasis on achieving the triple bottom line benefits. Sustainable development in the Industry 4.0 context contributes to circular economic objectives by achieving social, economic, and environmental benefits. Triple bottom line studies mainly focus on Industry 4.0 adoption and implementation, sustainable supply chains, smart and sustainable cities, and smart factories. Circular economy and sustainable business models as emerging research themes that focus on Industry 4.0 adoption and implementation, as well as sustainable supply chains. Our analysis consolidates emerging research patterns areas in both the Industry 4.0 and sustainability literature. Furthermore, it identifies salient research gaps and suggests future research.},

The parameters help to gather, analyze, and document information about incidentals security and network-based crime activities. It also supports the solving of a complication related to the network traffic in the cloud, virtual machine dynamic migration, virtual resources of cloud clients, provides an environment like multi-tenancy, does not infringe on the security and protection of other cloud users, and most important, avoids transferring costs of large sets of data and processed directly. Cloud security and M2M communication permit the discovery of the best conceivable security configuration, improve communication, self-monitoring, and diagnose cloud security issues without the need for human intervention. Restrictions and crucial points are emphasized to arrange for initial forensics investigations and also further studies in this area. This chapter presents a model that is generic in nature for network forensics in the cloud environment as well as defines prototype artifact that articulates the M2M communication security issue that impacts on fourth industrial revolution application. We validate the architecture prototype with an implementation based on the OpenNebula Hypervisor web-based interface and the NetworkMiner analysis framework.},

  year   = {2021},

  abstract       = {For this chapter, water 4.0 is defined as the industry 4.0 concept applied to the water sector. As industry 4.0 reflects the fourth industrial revolution, water 4.0 reflects the fourth water revolution. Based on the literature review and case studies, this chapter examines a proposition that water 4.0 will increase not only the sector’s economic effectiveness but also sustainability including climate resilience.

Relevant technologies include digital twins, visualization, wireless monitoring sensors, industrial internet of things (IoT/IIoT), cloud computing, and predictive or prescriptive analytics but also blockchain, drones, and cybersecurity. For water 4.0 becoming a reality, water utility companies need not only collect more data but also to have proper analytical tools in place to convert data into information supporting optimal decisions. The current tools should preferably be replaced by machine learning algorithms that are nonlinear, nonstationary, and dynamic and thus aligned closely with the real world.

It has been suggested in this chapter that such disruptive technologies be introduced through an ISO 55001-based asset management system (AMS). ISO 19650 series supplements ISO 55001 and contains additional requirements for the AMS development by focusing particularly on asset information. For this purpose, the series provides assistance with big data and digital twins.

Two approaches are applicable to the implementation of water 4.0 through AMS: adaptability and more traditional continuous improvement with the former considered in this chapter as preferred but requires a sufficient level of asset management maturity. Therefore, it might be prudent that every organization sets their own water 4.0-related standards and objectives in their own AMS and considers the preferred level of adaptability. Adaptability is arguably required for water 4.0 with adaptation bringing the greatest value.},

Memoryless property of exponential distribution is also reflected and considered in the calculations of forest fire probabilities. Stochastic and dynamic properties of the situation and the mathematical complexity of the routing problem entailed and justified a simulation study. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach for routing UAVs and the validity of the proposed model are tested on a small sized realistic scenario. Experimental results encourage the development of complex models. Integrating the proposed model with advanced information technologies may lead to the development of a digital twin system.},

In this study, we identified the evolution of themes inherent in the industry 4.0 using a bibliometric software, namely SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool). The analyses included 1882 documents, 4231 keywords, and the relevant information was extracted based on frequency of co-occurrence of keywords. The clusters were plotted in two-dimensional strategic diagrams and analysed using the bibliometric indicators such as the number of publications, number of associated documents, and h-index. The results revealed that 2017 had the largest number of publications. Expert authors in the field and the periodicals that published the most were identified. The science mapping presented 31 clusters in which the most representative motor themes were CPS (Cyber-Physical System), IoT (Internet of Things), and Big Data. In addition, it was possible to identify fields with high investment of efforts by the scientific community such as the union between lean production and industry 4.0, production-centered CPS (CPPS), IoT (Industrial Internet of Things - IIoT), among others. The overlapping map showed an increase in the number of keywords from 338 to 1231 over the period of data. The map of scientific developments supported by an exhaustive research, it was possible to show the state of the art, the main challenges and perspectives for future research in the field of industry 4.0 such as Technology, Collaboration/Integration, Management and Implementation.},

In practical approaches, one finds many pitfalls restraining the application of these modern technologies especially in brownfield applications. With this paper, we want to show state of the art and what to expect when working with stock machines in the field. The paper is a review of literature found to cover challenges for cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) in brownfield applications. This review is combined with our own personal experience and findings gained while setting up such systems in processing and packaging machines as well as in other areas. A major focus in this paper is on data collection, which tends be more cumbersome than most people might expect. In addition, data quality for machine learning applications is a challenge once leaving the laboratory and its academic data sets. Topics here include missing ground truth or the lack of semantic description of the data. A last challenge covered is IT security and passing data through firewalls to allow for the cyber part in CPPS. However, all of these findings show that potentials of data driven production systems are strongly depending on data collection to build proclaimed new automation systems with more flexibility, improved human–machine interaction and better process-stability and thus less waste during manufacturing.},

While the development of the Internet of Things resembles in many aspects the characteristics of for example semiconductor and IT platforms, there are some essential differences, mainly in scale and scope, that make the kickstart of a successful IoT more complex.

  abstract       = {Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed ICS streams using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically produces a very large DFA and a high false-alarm rate. In this article, we introduce a new modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to their respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the statechart from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning algorithms first build a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the stream. Next, we split the symbols into sets, one per multiplexed cycle, based on symbol frequencies and node degrees in the DTMC graph. Then, we create a sub-graph for each cycle and extract Euler cycles for each sub-graph. The final statechart is comprised of one DFA per Euler cycle. The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, which appear in more than one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once in a cycle. We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a collection of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed ICS traces with varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The algorithms were able to split the symbols into sets with 99.6% accuracy. The resulting statechart modeled the traces with a median false-alarm rate of as low as 0.483%. In all but the most extreme scenarios, the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm rate and the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA model.},

Integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with the ICT infrastructure is an emerging issue to not only accommodate growing EV fleets but also for cost-effective deep decarbonization as energy storage. In this chapter, we review rapidly evolving smart cities and its definition, infrastructure, and disruptive blockchain applications for energy and EV integration. Then, we move on to the vehicle to X technology, a critical application for the future urban decarbonization. Finally, we introduce an important digital platform software (IoT platform), FI (Future Internet)-WARE.},

This should enable us to realize an integrated business process based on a digital twin. The digital twin therefore forms the basis for the conception and development of RPA. This article de-scribes findings from the application of digital twins for RPA development. This is based on a case study of public administration. As a result, the case’s processes are examined and thus the real proce-dures are discovered and analyzed with its interactions and logical links.

To this end, we analyze annual reports and research on the issues of digital transformation, economic and sustainable development of the leading companies in the global electronic industry, namely: Samsung, Intel, and NVIDIA. For a better understanding of the correlation among the key components of the research subject, we apply the methods of schematization and classification of objects. The study shows four types of digital transformation management strategies depending on the level of the organization’s digital maturity and the goals of its sustainable development. We conclude that sustainable development (including economic, social and environmental ones) in the long term in the current environment of complicated global economic and internal economic relations can be achieved, first of all, through the comprehensive digital transformation of the organization. In other words, digitally matured companies can achieve sustainability, and, therefore, competitiveness.},

More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and many cities have already transformed into “smart digital/virtual hubs. Digital services ensure city life safe without an economy lockout and unemployment. Urban society strives to be safe, sustainable, well-being, and healthy. We set the task to construct a hybrid sociological and technological concept of a smart city with matched solutions, complementary to each other. Our modeling with the elaborated digital architectures and with the bionic solution for ensuring sufficient data governance showed that a smart city in comparison with the traditional city is tightly interconnected inside like a social “organism. Society has entered a decisive decade during which the world will change by moving closer towards SDGs targets 2030 as well as by the transformation of cities and their digital infrastructures. It is important to recognize the large vector of sociological transformation as smart cities are just a transition phase to human-centered personal space or smart home. The “atomization of the world urban population raises the gap problem in achieving SDGs because of different approaches to constructing digital architectures for smart cities or smart homes in countries. The strategy of creating smart cities should bring each citizen closer to SDGs at the individual level, laying in the personal space the principles of sustainable development and wellness of personality.},

The digital economy, which includes a wide range of IT technologies in business processes and models, helps to stimulate demand growth, leading to an increase in productivity and employment of the population, has the potential to achieve inclusive results.In the context of rapid digitalization, it is becoming clear that digital innovation, called digital transformation, is becoming the main driving force behind social transformation. The transition to sustainable development and for all must be consistent with the goals, risks, opportunities and dynamics of the digitalization of the economy. At the same time, digital transformation will radically change all processes occurring in the global economy and every state, therefore, it will change the interpretation of the very paradigm of sustainable development. Digitization is not only a "tool" for addressing sustainable development challenges but also a fundamental driver of disruptive change.Advanced technologies are now the driving force behind what has been dubbed Industry 4.0, with the potential to transform Russia's industrial sectors and significant social, economic and environmental impacts on society. This digital transformation of business and society in Russia represents a huge growth potential for the country in the context of the stagnation of the global consumer market and its transition to a digital environment.},

Changes can include: change in user needs; system mission changes; competition and teaming changes; and changing threat performance. Disruptions may also cause the systems engineer to adapt in the environment and workplace such as disruptions in technology, processes, and people-system interfaces. Future systems engineering efforts may be applied to different domains other than the traditional defense and aerospace projects. These include healthcare, transportation, environment, cybersecurity and Internet of Things, and manufacturing. Systems engineers may need to reconsider the traditional modality of their education. Some of these areas for consideration are core systems engineering topics, systems thinking, and the transdisciplinary development of ideas.},

A large spectrum of the well-known tools for software configuration management is available. However, most of them do not solve problems emerging in the considered subject domain fully. To this end, we propose a new framework for implementing preparing, debugging, delivering, testing, deploying, and configuring virtualized software of digital twins. Currently, we are developing such twins for analyzing the operation of environmentally friendly equipment of infrastructural objects located in the Baikal natural territory. The proposed framework is based on the integrated applying methods and tools of knowledge engineering, multi-agent technologies, conceptual and service-oriented programming, and administration of hybrid distributed computing systems. These systems can include both personal resources and resources of public access centers, grid systems, and cloud or fog platforms. We carried out the practical experiments with the framework prototype. The obtained results have shown that significant speedup in performing the aforementioned processes can be achieved.},

Therefore, the minimization of engine operating cost per flight-hour is a key aspect for airlines to operate successfully under challenging market conditions. The interaction between maintenance cost, operating cost, asset value, lease and replacement cost describes the area of conflict in which engine fleets can be optimized. State-of-the-art fleet management is based on advanced diagnostic and prognostic methods on engine and component level to provide optimized long-term removal and work-scoping forecasts on fleet level based on the individual operation. The key element of these methods is a digital twin of the active engines consisting of multilevel models of the engine and its components. This digital twin can be used to support deterioration and failure analysis, predict life consumption of critical parts and relate the specific operation of a customer to the real and expected condition of the engines on-wing and at induction to the shop. The fleet management data is constantly updated based on operational data sent from the engines as well as line maintenance and shop data. The approach is illustrated along the real application on the CFM56-5C, a mature commercial two-spool high bypass engine installed on the Airbus A340-300. It can be shown, that the new methodology results in major improvements on the considered fleets.},

In this study, we propose a software-defined framework that improves network intrusion detection systems by using manufacturer usage description (MUD) to enhance the behavioral monitoring in IoT networks. We aim to explore whether industrial IoT devices typically serve a common role in cyber-physical systems, and their communications exhibit predictable patterns that can be defined in MUD profile(s) formally and succinctly. We design a framework that utilizes the concept of digital twins and software-defined networking to improve the security of Industrial IoT environments. The MUD data are profiled, and the actions are evaluated on the network digital twin before they are used in the physical network. The behavioral profiling system is updated in real time, thereby improving the overall system security and compliance to policies in the IoT deployment. Evaluation results show that our solution outperforms existing approaches substantially in terms of attack detection accuracy, predicting security incidents, response time, and resource usage.},

The chapter also addresses the importance of organizational, interorganizational, and cultural changes to benefit from the potential of blockchain. It argues that while some actors may see an opportunity to distort the truth for profitable gains, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery can change the economics of truth and bring blockchain closer to a truth machine. Recommendations and implications for policymakers, companies, and scholarly research are discussed.},

This chapter uses a number of practical applications and real-world examples to delve into blockchain's roles in contributing to these objectives. A key argument is that blockchain makes it possible to trace ingredients and components across multiple tiers of a supply chain because data must be shared in a tamperproof way and must be accessible to relevant parties. Blockchain, thus, facilitates traceability, which is among the key mechanisms by which blockchain can help firms meet the various supply chain objectives.},

All of these aspects are not independent and even due to the system dynamics the optimal solution may differ depending on the actual situation applying specific requirements. The planning, optimization and operation of these complex systems requires modern, data and simulation driven multi criteria decision approaches. Simulation based analyses can be uses through all phases on different planning and operating levels. In order to improve operative decision making in production and logistic enterprises the digital twin concept, using virtual clones of real systems or subsystems, can be applied. Due to improved network and computing power operative simulation concepts are starting now to be realized in industrial practice.},

Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, simulation, robotics, augmented reality, virtual reality, horizontal and vertical integrations, and other related technologies can act as core enablers for creation of smart factories. A successful implementation of Industry 4.0 for developing new age smart digital manufacturing environment demands careful interactions and exchange of information between different enablers via digital thread and digital twin technologies. Data plays a vital role for all enablers in Industry 4.0 scenario. The biggest challenges related to data in Industry 4.0-related smart factories are safety, protection, retrieval, and sharing, as the same data is commonly used by different collaborators. Product life cycle management (PLM) can be a key enabler in Industry 4.0 for all such data-related issues through its unique and proven core capabilities. This chapter initially highlights the importance and challenges of different enablers in Industry 4.0 context and further reviews different applications of PLM in Industry 4.0. Benefits of PLM for fourth revolution manufacturing industries have been discussed. Challenges along with future directions of PLM have been mentioned towards the end of the chapter.},

The key questions facing firms are: How can we capitalize on the three primary dimensions (the increasing new-age technology adoption, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of key stakeholders) and overcome their associated challenges to achieve sustainable firm growth? This study aims to revive the thinking based on the growth strategy literature in the current environment, by presenting a 4E growth strategy matrix comprising of entrenching, empowering, enterprising, and enriching growth strategies. We propose that a firm can invest resources to maximize on one, two, or all three primary dimensions to produce the four growth strategies. We present an organizing framework based on insights from our triangulated research approach. Each of the growth strategies discussed will result in building certain types of firm capabilities, which will then lead to serving the needs and well-being of the key stakeholders. We also present an extensive research agenda that emerges from the four growth strategies.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is a digital revolution being witnessed in the present generation whereby the aim is to digitize the entire manufacturing process with minimal human or manual intervention. The aim is to encompass as many industries as feasible and adapt and enhance the existing technologies to better suit the needs of digital manufacturing. Concepts like smart manufacturing, smart factories and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are some of the key buzzwords of industry 4.0. The success of industry 4.0 lies to a large extent in successful integration and adaptation of various existing and emerging technologies with the present manufacturing process. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the basic concept of industry 4.0 including how it came up, the principles, building blocks and the key technologies and concepts around which it is built and is targeted to develop. To incorporate or upgrade to industry 4.0, any business or organization must undergo many complicated and time-consuming procedures to transit and incorporate the concepts and strategies of industry 4.0 into their current methodologies and techniques. The aspects of maturity and feasibility with respect to the business scenario are also discussed. Industry 4.0 incorporates technologies from a wide range of domains and in turn demands massive changes like those in innovation, production, logistics and service processes. These are also discussed. The chapter concludes with the concept of sustainability as applicable to industry 4.0.},

  abstract       = {Smart grid (SG), an evolving concept in the modern power infrastructure, enables the two-way flow of electricity and data between the peers within the electricity system networks (ESN) and its clusters. The self-healing capabilities of SG allow the peers to become active partakers in ESN. In general, the SG is intended to replace the fossil fuel-rich conventional grid with the distributed energy resources (DER) and pools numerous existing and emerging know-hows like information and digital communications technologies together to manage countless operations. With this, the SG will able to “detect, react, and pro-act to changes in usage and address multiple issues, thereby ensuring timely grid operations. However, the “detect, react, and pro-act features in DER-based SG can only be accomplished at the fullest level with the use of technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the Blockchain (BC). The techniques associated with AI include fuzzy logic, knowledge-based systems, and neural networks. They have brought advances in controlling DER-based SG. The IoT and BC have also enabled various services like data sensing, data storage, secured, transparent, and traceable digital transactions among ESN peers and its clusters. These promising technologies have gone through fast technological evolution in the past decade, and their applications have increased rapidly in ESN. Hence, this study discusses the SG and applications of AI, IoT, and BC. First, a comprehensive survey of the DER, power electronics components and their control, electric vehicles (EVs) as load components, and communication and cybersecurity issues are carried out. Second, the role played by AI-based analytics, IoT components along with energy internet architecture, and the BC assistance in improving SG services are thoroughly discussed. This study revealed that AI, IoT, and BC provide automated services to peers by monitoring real-time information about the ESN, thereby enhancing reliability, availability, resilience, stability, security, and sustainability.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Over the past few years, Industry 4.0 has received significant global attention owning to its capability to enhance the sustainability and future competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. However, manufacturers are experiencing numerous difficulties while implementing Industry 4.0 due to the sheer number of barriers. In light of this, the present study aims to identify the Industry 4.0 barriers and prioritize the strategies to overcome these barriers for the successful implementation of Industry 4.0. Based on the extensive literature review and discussion with experts, a total of twenty-three Industry 4.0 barriers and eighteen strategies were identified and finalized. This research proposes a hybrid framework using Modified Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment methods to propose the strategies to overcome the Industry 4.0 barriers. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed framework, an empirical case investigation of an Indian auto component manufacturing company has been carried out. The findings of this study reveal that “Commitment from top management towards Industry 4.0 implementation is the top-ranked strategy, followed by ‘Framing of a strategic roadmap for Industry 4.0 implementation’ and  “Align people, process and technology for effective change management to mitigate the impact of Industry 4.0 barriers. The proposed framework offers a systematic approach for the practitioners to understand and analyze the various barriers and strategies to overcome these barriers for successful implementation of Industry 4.0.},

  abstract       = {The manufacturing sector has undergone a significant transformation using revolutionary Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies that have profoundly changed production processes and operations. To unlock the digitalization of sustainable production systems, manufacturing organizations are keen to adopt digital technologies to enhance performance. This paper analyses the social acceptability dimensions of I4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing (DM) and proposes a novel framework. The dimensions were identified through an extensive literature review. A data set of 121 responses was collected from different Indian manufacturing units and exploratory factor analysis was employed with dimensions structured into seven categories - safety, psychological, behavioural, compliance, cultural, employee and market. To develop inter-relationships amongst the main dimensions, a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique was utilized. Based on the priority order, 'security breaches' is the most significant dimension, followed by 'data theft'. The study contributes to both the theory of socio-technical transition (TSTT) and social cognition theory (SCT) by describing the impact of I4.0 technologies on social and personal behaviour. The study findings make significant contributions to both the practical and managerial perspectives of I4.0 technologies for the growth of DM. This paper provides fruitful insights for decision-makers and industry practitioners to develop a DM environment.},

  abstract    = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on advanced communication and control technologies to efficiently manage devices and the flow of information in the system. However, a wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into connected and integrated networks. This is also the case for CI such as a smart grid. Smart grid security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to provide its users a platform to train and test cyber attacks, in a safe and controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying physical configuration and difficulty to scale. To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on smart grids. On the developed twin, the users can deploy real world attacks and countermeasures, to test and study its effectiveness. The difference from the physical test-bed is that its users may easily modify their power system components and configurations. Further, reproducing the twin for using and advancing the research is significantly cheaper. The developed twin has advanced features compared to any equivalent system in the literature. To illustrate a typical use case, we present a case study where a cyber attack is launched and discuss its implications.},

This paper describes how centralized and decentralized DTs can help to monitor and control future power systems with special consideration of their interaction in case of corrupted communication from cyber-attacks. While the virtual representation of substations is regarded from the edge computing perspective the control room of the interconnected power system represents the centralized perspective. The concepts allows to have a system wide perspective, while also keeping detailed information at hand. The future system operator in the control room will benefit from services provided by DTs analytical and control features, rising resilience to cyber-physical anomalies and enhance situational awareness.},

  abstract    = {The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.},

  abstract       = {Abstract With increasing automation of manufacturing processes (focusing on technologies  such as robotics and human-robot interaction), there is a realisation that the manufacturing process and the artefacts/products it produces can be better connected post-production. Built on this requirement, a “chatty" factory involves creating products which are able to send data back to the manufacturing/production environment as they are used, whilst still ensuring user privacy. The intended use of a product during design phase may different significantly from actual usage. Understanding how this data can be used to support continuous product refinement, and how the manufacturing process can be dynamically adapted based on the availability of this data provides a number of opportunities. We describe how data collected on product use can be used to: (i) classify product use; (ii) associate a label with product use using unsupervised learning—making use of edge-based analytics; (iii) transmission of this data to a cloud environment where labels can be compared across different products of the same type. Federated learning strategies are used on edge devices to ensure that any data captured from a product can be analysed locally (ensuring data privacy).},

Their highly scalable, data-driven, and software-centric operating models increasingly collide with incumbent companies and poise an existential threat to their business. Just think about Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android smartphones, for example. Built on a consistent digital platform, both companies attracted ever-expanding ecosystems of third-party app developers that ultimately caused Nokia to tumble from a position of phone industry dominance into irrelevance. This story is threatening to repeat everywhere across the economy: The cloud computing services of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are challenging traditional software and hardware providers, the online marketplaces of Amazon and Alibaba are replacing traditional retailers and challenge companies like on-demand Walmart, and the video delivery services of Netflix and Hulu are about to disrupt traditional pay TV providers. Another very popular example is the online booking platforms Airbnb and Booking.com that leverage digital technologies to simplify booking and offer personalized and individually tailored travel experiences while disrupting the business of traditional hotel chains including Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt. In order to capture the benefits of digital technologies, established organizations – independently of whether they operate in the public or private sector – are forced to incorporate them into their own ecosystem to advance their product and service portfolios through an organizational change process that is commonly referred to as digital transformation. This process of technology adaptation is particularly challenging for companies that were – in contrast to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others – not “born digital since those companies need to undergo far-reaching business transitions that may well overturn established job designs and internal business processes and require novel ways of thinking and collaboration.},

In each case, we describe the target abilities, consider design alternatives, note some open questions, and review prior research. After this, we return to justified agency, offering a hypothesis about its relation to explanatory and normative behavior. We conclude by proposing testbeds and experiments to evaluate this empirical claim and encouraging other researchers to contribute to this crucial area.},

Especially German enterprises reached a high degree of maturity regarding the implementation of Lean Production Systems. Another, newer concept is Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is one of the most promising approaches to handle future production problems. For example, the flexibility of the production system resulting from Industry 4.0 helps manufacturers to cope with the high demand for customized products. However, Industry 4.0 entails deep technical and organizational changes for production systems, that may affect a Lean Production System. It needs to be considered that there are not only positive combinations of Lean Production Systems and Industry 4.0. It is unclear, how both concepts can be operated together and which methods are useful to fulfill the aims of a modern production system. The paper addresses this issue by presenting the development of a method library for the combination of the elements of the Lean Production System and technologies of Industry 4.0. For this purpose, the reciprocal effects of the Lean Production System and the Industry 4.0 technologies are examined regarding the scope of production. These results are the foundation of the method library where all combined methods are consistently presented.},

  abstract       = {Robots are no longer stand-alone systems on the factory floor. The demand for industrial robots (market) is anticipated to be growing to 65 billion euros by the year 2023. Within all areas of robotics, the demand for collaborative and more flexible systems is rising as well. The level of desired collaboration and increased flexibility will only be reached if the systems are developed as a whole, e.g. perception, reasoning and physical manipulation. The rising need for collaborative robots in the automation industry is acting as a driver for this market and is expected to serve as a market opportunity for future growth. However, at the same time especially smaller companies have difficulties to formulate a concrete vision and strategies for the uptake of robotics, finding skilled workforce to develop and deploy the robot systems and/or work in the manufacturing industry. A number of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) have been developed to enhance the knowledge and technology transfer from laboratories to factory floors, mitigating the skills gap and supporting the formulation of innovation ecosystems with the specific focus on small and medium-sized companies around Europe. The main aim of this paper is to introduce the concept and approach taken in H2020 TRINITY-project that aims to develop a Robotics Innovation Hub focused on Agile Production. The paper will introduce the concept and technical approach of the project, and discusses the preliminary results, challenges and opportunities of these kind of DIHs.},

This integration carries along both challenges and new opportunities. The combination of software and hardware elements implies more complex systems that are prone to intricate interdependencies that affect the overall reliability. To this, usually, we need to add the human-computer interaction that is also a vital aspect of the functioning of CPS, which further complicates the reliability calculations. Unreliable systems can mean huge losses, both financially as well as in human lives. On a positive note, CPS have data as a central element of their operation. The availability and prevalence of data present a new opportunity to transform the ways in which reliability assessment has been traditionally performed. The goal of this contribution is to provide a holistic overview of the reliability analysis of CPS, as well as identify the impact that data and new data infrastructures may have on it. We, furthermore, illustrate the key points through two well-known cases of CPS, smart buildings and smart factories.},

  volume         = {109},
  abstract       = {Federated Learning (FL) is an efficient and secure machine learning technique designed for decentralized computing systems such as fog and edge computing. Its learning process employs frequent communications as the participating local devices send updates, either gradients or parameters of their models, to a central server that aggregates them and redistributes new weights to the devices. In FL, private data does not leave the individual local devices, and thus, rendered as a robust solution in terms of privacy preservation. However, the recently introduced membership inference attacks pose a critical threat to the impeccability of FL mechanisms. By eavesdropping only on the updates transferring to the center server, these attacks can recover the private data of a local device. A prevalent solution against such attacks is the differential privacy scheme that augments a sufficient amount of noise to each update to hinder the recovering process. However, it suffers from a significant sacrifice in the classification accuracy of the FL. To effectively alleviate the problem, this paper proposes a Digestive Neural Network (DNN), an independent neural network attached to the FL. The private data owned by each device will pass through the DNN and then train the FL. The DNN modifies the input data, which results in distorting updates, in a way to maximize the classification accuracy of FL while the accuracy of inference attacks is minimized. Our simulation result shows that the proposed DNN shows significant performance on both gradient sharing- and weight sharing-based FL mechanisms. For the gradient sharing, the DNN achieved higher classification accuracy by 16.17% while 9% lower attack accuracy than the existing differential privacy schemes. For the weight sharing FL scheme, the DNN achieved at most 46.68% lower attack success rate with 3% higher classification accuracy.},

To overcome this obstacle, enterprises are establishing data democratization initiatives that can empower employees to use data and extract additional business value from them. However, IS research on data democratization has been scarce and has yet to explain how companies build their data democratization capability. Leveraging a multiple case study involving eight companies, we identify five enablers of data democratization: (1) Broader data access, (2) Self-service analytics tools, (3) Development of data and analytics skills, (4) Collaboration and knowledge sharing, and (5) Promotion of data value. As academic contribution, our findings clarify the concept of data democratization and shed light on the differences between traditional and born-digital companies. For practitioners, our study delivers actionable insights to tailor their data democratization initiatives.},

Digital processes consist of data, rules or algorithms. Process automation is any workflow that controls itself by use of computers and software. Enabling technologies include robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT), to name a few. Such technologies do not work in isolation. Instead, they come usually as bundled in solutions. There are many use cases for the digitization and automation of processes in the logistics industry—in the area of logistics corridors and trade hubs, trade facilitation, consumer touch points and interaction, circular services, digital platforms and marketplaces, supply chain monitoring, risk management, trade and supply chain finance, and talent search and training, and decision making. Estimates indicate that logistics technologies could cut shipping and customs processing times by 16 to 28%. Collaboration is essential to extract the value.},

  abstract       = {Sustainability is a pressing need, as well as an engineering challenge, in the modern world. Developing smart technologies is a critical way to ensure that future manufacturing systems are sustainable. Blockchain is a next-generation development of information technology for realizing sustainability in businesses and industries. Much research on blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 has been conducted from technical, commercial, organizational, and operational perspectives. This paper surveys how blockchain can overcome potential barriers to achieving sustainability from two perspectives, namely, the manufacturing system perspective and the product lifecycle management perspective. The survey first examines literature on these two perspectives, following which the state of research in blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing is presented, which sheds new light on urgent issues as part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We found that blockchain-empowered transformation of a sustainable manufacturing paradigm is still in an early stage of the hype phase, proceeding toward full adoption. The survey ends with a discussion of challenges regarding techniques, social barriers, standards, and regulations with respect to blockchain-empowered manufacturing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and social barriers that blockchain technology must overcome to demonstrate its sustainability in industrial and business spheres.},

  abstract       = {The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.},

  abstract       = {A smart manufacturing system (SMS) is a multi-field physical system with complex couplings among various components. Usually, designers in various fields can only design subsystems of an SMS based on the limited cognition of dynamics. Conducting SMS designs concurrently and developing a unified model to effectively imitate every interaction and behavior of manufacturing processes are challenging. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulations to reduce the vast time and cost of physical commissioning/reconfiguration by the early detection of design errors/flaws of the SMS. However, the development of the digital twins concept in the SMS design remains vague. An innovative Function-Structure-Behavior-Control-Intelligence-Performance (FSBCIP) framework is proposed to review how digital twins technologies are integrated into and promote the SMS design based on a literature search in the Web of Science database. The definitions, frameworks, major design steps, new blueprint models, key enabling technologies, design cases, and research directions of digital twins-based SMS design are presented in this survey. It is expected that this survey will shed new light on urgent industrial concerns in developing new SMSs in the Industry 4.0 era.},

  abstract       = {The research objective of this work is to enhance the perception of, sensing in, and control of smart manufacturing systems (SMS) by leveraging active sensor systems within smart products during the manufacturing phase. Smart manufacturing utilizes rich process data, usually collected by the SMS (e.g., machine tools), to enable accurate tracking and monitoring of individual products throughout the process chain. However, until now, the to-be-manufactured product itself has not contributed to the sensing and compilation of product and process data. More specifically, data measured from the product’s structure during its own fabrication. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the opportunity to actively use the capabilities of smart products within a SMS in terms of technical and economic feasibility. This opportunity emerged only recently with the advancements in smart products engineering. In this research, we developed a smart product prototype and evaluated it on a SMS testbed (CPlab) with eight distinct, fully-connected manufacturing processes. The results of the conducted experiments show the possibility to uniquely identify two distinct ‘fingerprints’ of manufacturing processes solely based on data provided by sensors within the smart product itself. The sensor data was collected directly from the smart product before manufacture was completed, yet after the intended sensor functionality during the product’s use phase was activated. The capability to automatically, accurately, and reliably identify process signatures and even inform the optimization of manufacturing parameters creates new opportunities for improvements in quality, scheduling, and seamless transparency across the whole value chain.},

Here, a workflow based on a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm is described for the model-assisted development of biotechnological processes. By using the NMPC algorithm, the process is designed with respect to a target function (product yield, biomass concentration) with a drastically decreased number of experiments. A workflow for the usage of the NMPC algorithm as a process development tool is outlined. The NMPC algorithm is capable of improving various process states, such as product yield and biomass concentration. It uses on-line and at-line data and controls and optimizes the process by model-based process extrapolation. In this study, the algorithm is applied to a Corynebacterium glutamicum process. In conclusion, the potency of the NMPC algorithm as a powerful tool for process development is demonstrated. In particular, the benefits of the system regarding the characterization and optimization of a fed-batch process are outlined. With the NMPC algorithm, process development can be run simultaneously to strain development, resulting in a shortened time to market for novel products.},

  abstract       = {Digital Transformation (DT) enabled businesses to reshape the way they design, produce, and deliver their products and services, creating a competitive edge. Simultaneously, it enables business process improvement by increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Despite these opportunities, DT projects bear a high risk level and require a structured approach. Thus, mastering the digital competencies is necessary for the future workforce, independently of their position. Current research, however, often keeps the operational level uninvestigated, focusing too much on the top-manager perspective. This paper aims at closing this gap by reviewing the literature on business process transformation and corresponding KPIs in manufacturing companies and validating the findings through expert interviews. We aggregate gained expertise from various perspectives into a KPI overview, combining the KPIs for production, maintenance, sustainability, and IT. This helps to reduce complexity and mitigate the risk of Digital Transformation projects, for example by applying simulation to predict project outcomes.},

  abstract       = {E-commerce logistics real estate (EcLRE) is on the rise with the rapid development of logistics industry and continuous prosperity of real estate. The profit model for EcLRE is moving towards offering professional logistics services instead of simple real estate leasing. As the attributes for real estate are definite and difficult to change, the improvement of logistics service becomes necessity for EcLRE service providers to gain competitiveness in the market. However, the heterogeneous requirements from different service demanders place great challenges for the EcLRE service providers. The most puzzled one is to prevent fragmentation of logistics resources to serve different demanders (customers). This phenomenon of resource fragmentation is aggravated by the implementation of demanders’ (customers’) own information technologies or management requirements. To achieve the central management of logistics resources to serve heterogeneous demanders becomes an imperative requirement for EcLRE service provider. Therefore, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled workflow operating system (Bc-WfOS) to centrally share heterogeneous logistics resources with different customers. Three key innovative technologies are involved to empower Bc-WfOS. The first one is gateway technology introduced to realize the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of heterogeneous logistics resources. Secondly, to effectively and efficiently coordinate logistics resources, a multi-dimensional workflow model is proposed with corresponding workflow operation mechanism to suit different business logic. Additionally, a resource blockchain is designed with the integration of blockchain technology with agent technology to guarantee the data reliability to provide accurate front-line resource execution data for different customers to conduct higher decision-makings. Aiming at verifying the proposed Bc-WfOS, a prototype system is also developed and implemented in laboratory environment for conducting experimental case studies based on a real-life case.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, human society has been witnessed to evolve fast to the era of big data, rendering the data sharing and privacy protection a key issue for the development of digital economies. Federated learning, as a novel pattern for distributed machine learning, is aimed to train a centralized model from decentralized datasets while protecting user privacy, and is now intensively studied in literature. However, a variety of technical challenges, e.g., security issues, incentive mechanism design, are still awaiting further research efforts. In this respect, blockchain proves to be an elegant solution for federated learning to overcome these issues, and thus has been applied in federated learning in many scenarios with success. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey for blockchain-enabled federated learning, proposed its technical framework and discussed the key research issues. This work represents the first attempt for reviewing the literature aiming at integrating blockchain and federated learning, and can be expected to offer useful guidance for establishing a new infrastructure for decentralized and secured data circulation, as well as promoting the development of related industries.},

However, security and privacy of Cybertwin still face various threats and challenges, which may impact future deployments for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. In this paper, we first introduce the architecture and promising applications of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. Then, we analyze essential data security and privacy preservation requirements for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. Particularly, we present the security reference architecture of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. As a case study, we investigate the migration of Cybertwin caused by vehicle mobility, and propose a handover authentication scheme to create new Cybertwin between vehicle and edge server based on proxy ring signature technique. Finally, we discuss several open research directions for achieving more secure Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X.},

  abstract       = {The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.},

Enterprises from different fields are taking advantage of its ability to simulate real-time working conditions and perform intelligent decision-making, where a cost-effective solution can be readily delivered to meet individual stakeholder demands. As a hot topic, many approaches have been designed and implemented to date. However, most approaches today lack a comprehensive review to examine DT benefits by considering both engineering product lifecycle management and business innovation as a whole. To fill this gap, this work conducts a state-of-the art survey of DT by selecting 123 representative items together with 22 supplementary works to address those two perspectives, while considering technical aspects as a fundamental. The systematic review further identifies eight future perspectives for DT, including modular DT, modeling consistency and accuracy, incorporation of Big Data analytics in DT models, DT simulation improvements, VR integration into DT, expansion of DT domains, efficient mapping of cyber-physical data and cloud/edge computing integration. This work sets out to be a guide to the status of DT development and application in today’s academic and industrial environment.},

Developing on top of Industry 4.0 paradigms, advanced robotics, predictive analytics, and process flow automation benefit from the use of digital replicas known as digital twins (DT). DT is a prevailing technology in manufacturing industries and leverages real-time monitoring, simulation, and decision-aid systems to generate feasible solutions to assist production operations, which can range from predictive maintenance to strategic planning. As a trending technology, many digital twin-driven approaches are formulated to achieve mass customization and implement smart product service systems. Hence, this chapter aims to provide insights into the various digital twin architectures and development trends in manufacturing environments. It also proposes the integration of other emerging technologies to allow stakeholders who are capitalizing on this technology to gain a significant competitive edge in the present competitive environment. With consideration to both business innovation and engineering product lifecycle management, this work serves as a guide to highlight the status of digital twin development trends and benefits with innovative use cases aiming at setting a consistent standard for digital twin creation throughout academia and industry.},

  abstract       = {In the past few years, blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin, has received considerable attention from academia and industry. It is widely accepted that blockchain technology causes disruptive changes in supply chain operations that can overcome supply chain difficulties encountered in realizing information sharing, maintaining traceability in the entire process and improving operational efficiency. However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential. This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations. A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes. This article provides valuable information to help scholars and practitioners better determine the relevant research topics to accelerate the development of blockchain-based supply chains.},

  abstract       = {The continuing expansion of connected and electro-mobility products and services has led to their ability to rapidly generate very large amounts of data, leading to a demand for effective data management solutions. This is further catalysed through the need for society to make informed policies and decisions that can properly support their emerging growth. While data systems and platforms exist, they are often proprietary, being only compatible to the products that they are designed for. Given the products and services generate energy and spatial-temporal data that can often correlate, a lack of interoperability between these systems would impede decision making, as data from each system must be considered independently. By studying currently available data platforms and frameworks, this paper weighs the problems that these products address, and identifies necessary gaps for a more cohesive platform to exist. This is performed through a top-down approach, whereby broader vehicle-to-everything approaches are first studied, before moving to the components that could comprise a data platform to integrate and ingest these various data feeds. Finally, potential design considerations for a data platform is presented, along with examples of application benefits that would enable users to make more informed and holistic decisions about current mobility options.},

  abstract       = {To fulfill increasingly difficult and demanding tasks in the ever-changing complex world, intelligent industrial products are to be developed with higher flexibility and adaptability. Digital twin (DT) brings about a possible means, due to its ability to provide candidate behavior adjustments based on received “feedbacks from its physical part. However, such candidate adjustments are deterministic, and thus lack of flexibility and adaptability. To address such problem, in this paper an extended concept – evolutionary digital twin (EDT) and an EDT-based new mode for intelligent industrial product development has been proposed. With our proposed EDT, a more precise approximated model of the physical world could be established through supervised learning, based on which the collaborative exploration for optimal policies via parallel simulation in multiple cyberspaces could be performed through reinforcement learning. Hence, more flexibility and adaptability could be brought to industrial products through machine learning (such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning) based self-evolution. As a primary verification of the effectiveness of our proposed approach, a case study has been carried out. The experimental results have well confirmed the effectiveness of our EDT based development mode.},

  year  = {2021},
  pages = {1--1},
  abstract       = {The emergence of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DTENs) achieves the mapping of real physical entities to digital models of cyberspace. By offloading real-time mobile data to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers for processing and modeling, communication-efficient Digital Twin (DT) services could be achieved. However, the spatio-temporal dynamic DT service demand stochastically generated by mobile users easily causes service congestion, which challenges the long-term DT service stability. Meanwhile, current DT services still lack long-term effective incentive designs for participants. To solve these issues, we design an incentive-based congestion control scheme for stochastic demand response in DTENs. First, we adopt the Lyapunov optimization theory to decompose the long-term congestion control decision into a sequence of online edge association decisions, with no need for future system information. We then present a contract-based incentive design to optimize the long-term profit of the DT service provider, comprehensively considering the delay sensitivity, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme with the base station dataset of Shanghai Telecom. Theoretical and simulation analysis demonstrates that compared with benchmarks, our scheme could effectively avoid long-term service congestion with an arbitrarily near-optimal profit.},

Multiple factors have to be taken into consideration for a CPS that is aligned with the objectives of the organization and the intended use. Significant CPS achievements, namely real-time monitoring, automation, digital twin representation, and bi-directionality can only be achieved through proper understanding of CPS at various levels. Having a clear understanding of the requirements, processes, and characteristics of CPS is needed to make for proper CPS implementation in the industry. For this purpose, these requirements are evaluated in this chapter from three levels, namely, device level, platform level and system level, to cover all the factors from micro to macro perspective. This perspective may help a CPS implementation team to take a holistic review of the devices and platform alternatives that together define the characteristics of the system.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is the new industrial revolution involving the introduction of new technologies in the industrial field. However, changing the technological level of an outdated industry is not a simple task. By retrofitting all old equipment into new equipment in industries, the retrofitting concept emerges as a rapid and low-cost solution, aimed at reusing existing equipment, with the addition of new technologies. However, retrofitting changes according to the type and model of industrial equipment, making it challenging to upgrade industrial equipment to Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). In this paper, the standardization of the retrofitting process to transform old equipment into a CPPS is presented. The standardization is done with the support of a platform that has features to work independently of the model or type of equipment. To implement the platform, we define the requirements, components, and technologies necessary to retrofit industrial equipment. The entire process is based on Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) a widespread architecture of Industry 4.0. With the retrofitting platform based on RAMI 4.0, makes consistent the process of upgrading industrial equipment, providing Industry 4.0 functionality. A prototype with an industrial robotic arm was implemented to validate the process and the retrofitting platform. The results show the benefits of the CPPS Retrofitting process in industrial equipment.},

Due to the different specifics of the legislative bases of the investigated regions, such as the USA, China, EU, and Africa, the development of digital transformation is presented on the example of the Russian Federation in the context of world trends. The article presents an analysis of the possibilities of using straight-through digital technology in prospecting, design, development, and use of mineral resources. It describes a structure promoting the development of applied digital technology through research–education centers and international competence centers. This structure would allow forming the new competencies for personnel working in the digital economy. The underfunding of the information and computing infrastructure could be a significant challenge to the digital transformation of the economy. Creating the conditions for a reliable and secure process of generating, storing, and using data is the basis for protection from the cybersecurity hazard that could act as a brake on technology advancement. This article discusses the organizational and technological priorities of the development of the mineral resource sector on the example of the Russian Federation. The challenges for the mineral resource complex resulting from global changes can be taken on through technological changes of the industry. The article gives a thorough description of issues related to technological developments in the raw materials sector, oil refining industry, development of integrated and advanced mineral processing systems, and the use of household and industrial wastes. The research presents basic technology contributing to sustainable development, starting from exploration and production forecasting and up to sustainable planning and distribution of material and energy resources based on real-time data. It also pays special attention to the possibilities of creating digital platforms for the mineral sector. Digital integration, combining research areas, personnel, processes, users, and data will create conditions for scientific and technological achievements and breakthroughs, providing scientific and economic developments in related industries and, above all, in the global mineral and raw materials market.},

  abstract       = {Cyber-Physical Machine Tools (CPMT) represent a new generation of machine tools that are smarter, well connected, widely accessible, more adaptive and more autonomous. Development of CPMT requires standardized information modelling method and communication protocols for machine tools. This paper proposes a CPMT Platform based on OPC UA and MTConnect that enables standardized, interoperable and efficient data communication among machine tools and various types of software applications. First, a development method for OPC UA-based CPMT is proposed based on a generic OPC UA information model for CNC machine tools. Second, to address the issue of interoperability between OPC UA and MTConnect, an MTConnect to OPC UA interface is developed to transform MTConnect information model and its data to their OPC UA counterparts. An OPC UA-based CPMT prototype is developed and further integrated with a previously developed MTConnect-based CPMT to establish a common CPMT Platform. Third, different applications are developed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CPMT Platform, including an OPC UA Client, an advanced AR-assisted wearable Human-Machine Interface and a conceptual framework for CPMT powered cloud manufacturing environment. Experimental results have proven that the proposed CPMT Platform can significantly improve the overall production efficiency and effectiveness in the shop floor.},

An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.},

The concept of digital twin technology complies with the guiding ideology of not only Industry 4.0, but also Made in China 2025. This paper proposes a scheme that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with digital twin technology for controlling humanoid robot arms. For rapid and stable motion planning for humanoid robots, multitasking-oriented training using the twin synchro-control (TSC) scheme with DRL is proposed. For switching between tasks, the robot arm training must be quick and diverse. In this work, an approach for obtaining a priori knowledge as input to DRL is developed and verified using simulations. Two simple examples are developed in a simulation environment. We developed a data acquisition system to generate angle data efficiently and automatically. These data are used to improve the reward function of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and quickly train the robot for a task. The approach is applied to a model of the humanoid robot BHR-6, a humanoid robot with multiple-motion mode and a sophisticated mechanical structure. Using the policies trained in the simulations, the humanoid robot can perform tasks that are not possible to train with existing methods. The training is fast and allows the robot to perform multiple tasks. Our approach utilizes human joint angle data collected by the data acquisition system to solve the problem of a sparse reward in DRL for two simple tasks. A comparison with simulation results for controllers trained using the vanilla DDPG show that the designed controller developed using the DDPG with the TSC scheme have great advantages in terms of learning stability and convergence speed.},

Unfortunately, recent incidents show that MSPs themselves have become an attractive launchpad to gain access to customer networks. In this work, we argue that such incidents arise due to a violation of the least privilege principle. We revisit the MSP outsourcing problem through this least-privilege view, identify key challenges in realizing this framework, and present initial ideas toward this goal. In particular, we propose providing the MSP provider an isolated "digital twin" environment to resolve problems and prevent providers from directly accessing the customer production network. Changes are verified before importing them into the production network, ensuring there are no privilege violations. Our preliminary experiments show that our approach can resolve practical problems (e.g., misconfigurations) and is effective in reducing the attack surfaces for MSP customers.},

  abstract       = {Emerging Digital Twin (DT) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) are crucial for enabling rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works ignore the edge collaboration which can provide the system with additional performance gain. In this paper, we study the problem of Mobile Users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative Mobile Edge Servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a DT-assisted Task Offloading Scheme (DTTOS) which consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel State Information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two sub-optimization models and solved by Decision Tree Algorithm (DTA) and Double Deep-Q-Learning (DDQN) respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.},

Space systems must be designed to achieve cyber resilience. Existing vulnerabilities must be mitigated as resulted from a risk management methodology. To avoid compromises of security, a security monitoring mechanism and incident response for space systems have to be implemented. The authors provide an analysis of the functional capabilities and services of a “cybersecurity space operations center. System monitoring is essential in view of obtaining a cyber situational awareness and decision-making for space missions. Security operation center-related services could be built up in a permanent or in an ad hoc mobile infrastructure. An integrated cyber range capability to test, train, and exercise over modeled and simulated space systems will improve space operators’ skills when confronted with time-critical interventions.},

The present research study first proposes an Industrial Internet pyramid as emergent human-centric manufacturing paradigm within Industry 4.0 in which central is the role of a Ubiquitous Knowledge about the manufacturing system intuitively accessed and used by the manufacturing employees. Second, the prototype of a Service-oriented Digital Twin, which leverage on a flexible ontology-oriented knowledge structure and on augmented reality combined to a vocal interaction system for an intuitive knowledge retrieval and fruition, has been designed and developed to deliver this manufacturing knowledge. Two test-beds, complimentary for the problems in practice (the former on the maintenance-production interface in a large enterprise, the latter majorly focused in production and setups in a small and medium enterprise), show the significant benefits in terms of time, costs and process quality, thus validating the approach proposed. This research shows that a human-centric and knowledge-driven approach can drive the performance of Industry 4.0 initiatives and lead a Smart Factory towards its full potential.},

Information about the health status of patients, their personal data and the results of medical research are classified as confidential information, which is the object of increased attention of cybercriminals. The widespread transformation of healthcare organizations, the creation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystems based on wireless sensor networks are increasing the number of potential risks of confidential information leakage. Medical data requires constant protection. The problem of identifying risks in order to develop methods and tools for their management in the future is further complicated by the fact that Healthcare Industry is increasingly beginning to use the cloud architecture of the IoMT, which in turn increases the potential threats to patients' confidential information. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of ransomware programs that are being introduced into IoMT devices has increased, cyberattacks are becoming more complex with a significantly higher risk of fatal consequences for patients due to changes in the technical parameters of medical equipment by attackers. This makes it urgent to solve the problem of identifying possible risks in IoMT tools and systems, assessing their impact and possible consequences from unauthorized actions of intruders for patients and the medical organization as a whole.},

However, they need some "hands on" experience so that they know how challenging simulations can be, avoiding the trap of underestimating the effort involved. This paper describes the approach used at Georgia Tech to teach a compressed 7 week simulation survey course called ASE 6003 Modeling &amp; Simulation in Systems Engineering. We describe the techniques used, our approach and the results achieved over recent years of teaching simulation in this format.

  abstract       = {The continuous growth of airport operations generates continuous infrastructure expansion needs at international airports. In some cases, in the face of limitations in short-term expansions, the immediate solution is the creation of remote positions that allow a greater number of flights to be attended but which require the use of bus fleets to attend passenger boarding and disembarking operations. The sizing of the buses will allow to reduce the waiting times of flights below the level of service required by international standards. For this purpose, the development of a discrete event simulation model integrated to the transactional flight database is proposed. In the literature, although many references to simulation models have been found in airports, they have not been specifically focused in order to size and manage the bus fleet. Simulation experiments of this model under the management of scenarios allows to identify the bus fleet size required.},

  abstract       = {The prevalence of IoT enabled devices in the home has manifested in buildings as voice and gesture enabled devices that enable functions such as optimizing energy usage and controlling electrical fixtures. However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building's design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an "operating system" for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency. Methods for personalizing building performance to users can also be accomplished through the proposed methodology.},

  abstract       = {Recently, with the development of “Industry 4.0, “Oil and Gas 4.0 has also been put on the agenda in the past two years. Some companies and experts believe that “Oil and Gas 4.0 can completely change the status quo of the oil and gas industry, which can bring huge benefits because it accelerates the digitization and intelligentization of the oil and gas industry. However, the “Oil and Gas 4.0 is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper systematically introduces the concept and core technologies of “Oil and Gas 4.0, such as big data and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this paper analyzes typical application scenarios of the oil and gas industry chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) through examples, such as intelligent oilfield, intelligent pipeline, and intelligent refinery. It is concluded that the essence of “Oil and Gas 4.0 is a data-driven intelligence system based on the highly digitization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic peer-reviewed paper on the “Oil and Gas 4.0 era, aiming to let more oil and gas industry personnel understand its benefits and application scenarios, so as to better apply it to practical engineering in the future. In the discussion section, this paper also analyzes the opportunities and difficulties that may be brought about by the “Oil and Gas 4.0 era. Finally, relevant policy recommendations are proposed.},

  abstract       = {Malware is a serious threat to network-connected embedded systems, as evidenced by the continued and rapid growth of such devices, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Their ubiquitous use in critical applications require robust protection to ensure user safety and privacy. That protection must be applied to all system aspects, extending beyond protecting the network and external interfaces. Anomaly detection is one of the last lines of defence against malware, in which data-driven approaches that require the least domain knowledge are popular. However, embedded systems, particularly edge devices, face several challenges in applying data-driven anomaly detection, including unpredictability of malware, limited tolerance to long data collection windows, and limited computing/energy resources. In this article, we utilize subcomponent timing information of software execution, including intrinsic software execution, instruction cache misses, and data cache misses as features, to detect anomalies based on ranges, multi-dimensional Euclidean distance, and classification at runtime. Detection methods based on lumped timing range are also evaluated and compared. We design several hardware detectors implementing these data-driven detection methods, which non-intrusively measuring lumped/subcomponent timing of all system/function calls of the embedded application. We evaluate the area, power, and detection latency of the presented detector designs. Experimental results demonstrate that the subcomponent timing model provides sufficient features to achieve high detection accuracy with low false-positive rates using a one-class support vector machine, considering sophisticated mimicry malware.},

Building on the basis of 5 G, the development of 6 G will have a profound impact on the intelligence process of communication development, which consists of intelligent connectivity, deep connectivity, holographic connectivity, and ubiquitous connectivity. To identify 6 G and its related issues, we conducted a survey of extant research on 6 G. In this paper, its prospects, core technologies, scenarios, challenges, and the related issues are discussed. Moreover, a potential framework for 6 G is proposed as well. The main contribution of this survey is that it clarifies the state of the art of 6 G for future study.},

  abstract       = {Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning methods.},

  abstract       = {Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.},

Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.},

  abstract       = {Anomaly detection is crucial to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods, which face the growing volume of data and need domain-specific knowledge, cannot be directly applied to address these challenges. To this end, deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed. In this article, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation, and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. Also, we discuss the limitations and open problems of these methods. Moreover, to give users insights into choosing proper DLAD methods in practice, we experimentally explore the characteristics of typical neural models, the workflow of DLAD methods, and the running performance of DL models. Finally, we discuss the deficiencies of DL approaches, our findings, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods and motivate future research.},

  abstract       = {In the last decade, a shift toward Sustainable Development (SD) in engineering has started in the educational and occupational framework. Therefore, the need to rethink the professional figures of an engineer has become a necessity. Unfortunately, neither a formal methodology to define a standard engineer archetype nor procedural methods to evaluate such archetypes’ contribution to SD are investigated. This paper bridges the first gap by proposing a general methodology to define specific engineer archetypes as technical competences from educational - Semi Structured Intended Learning Outcomes (SS-ILOs) - and occupational - European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) - frameworks. The second gap is addressed by a procedural method based on indirect mapping of the identified archetypes onto United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). Since Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the working environment of future engineers and has a promising potential to achive SDGs, I4.0 technologies influences on SDGs are used as a bridge to evaluate sustainability of the defined enigineer archetypes. Finally, we provide the application of our proposed methodology to the Industrial engineering case study. The results show that significant limitations toward sustainability remain open challenges. However, the intrinsic nature of the industrial engineer is confined to some specific goals, and a characteristic signature on sustainability emerged.},

  abstract       = {The purpose is to explore the application effects and limitations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in 5G/B5G (Beyond 5G) mobile and wireless communication. Based on 5Gcommunication, the deep learning (DL) algorithm is introduced to construct the UAV Digital Twins (DTs) communication channel model based on DL. The Coordinated Multi-point Transmission (COMP) technology is adopted to study the interference suppression of UAVs. The key algorithm in the physical layer security is employed to ensure information communication security. Finally, the model constructed is simulated and analyzed. The transmission error rates and transmission estimation accuracy of several algorithms, including the proposed algorithm and ordinary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are compared under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Results find that the convergence speed and convergence effect of the proposed algorithm has prominent advantages, presenting strong robustness; the proposed algorithm's estimation accuracy is about 150 times higher than the traditional algorithms. Further analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm's accuracy reaches 82.39%, which increases by at least 3.2% than other classic machine algorithms. The indicators of Precision, Recall, and F1 are compared as well. Apparently, the Precision, Recall, and F1 values of the proposed algorithm are the highest, while the transmission delay is the smallest. Therefore, the constructed UAV DTs wireless communication channel model has strong robustness and further reduces UAV limitations, providing a reference for improving UAV system performance in the later stage.},

  abstract       = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the current technology acceptance model (TAM) in the field of mixed reality and digital twin (MRDT) and identify key factors affecting users' intentions to use MRDT. The factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users. This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis of secondary data contained within published journal articles that focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b) test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to 2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other important factors such as ``perceived immersion″ could be added to the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider acceptance.},

All of these phases will be characterized by a high level of dynamism: the driving behavior of automated cars and production processes in a factory will likewise be controlled by learning and adaptive systems that evolve over time to deal with quickly changing tasks and environments. Automated cars on the roads and robots in factories are both highly mobile and need to collaborate in dynamic neighborhoods. What are the ICT infrastructures and engineering methods that are required to build such highly dynamic but at the same time trustworthy autonomous systems? In this position paper we argue that in the context of infrastructure, a “Decimeter Internet will be needed that offers low-enough communication latencies, adequately accurate localization plus update rates equal to the task of dependably controlling mobile cars and robots at decimeter level.

  abstract       = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a paradigm shift, primarily in the domain of manufacturing industry. The concept is highly attractive for a majority of the industrial sectors due to better operational efficiency capabilities in the production process, smart objects identification mechanisms by embeddedness technologies, intelligent automation abilities and around the clock monitoring abilities. Importantly, it reduces workforce intervention in risky industrial environments. Some of the best practicing places and activities for the IIoT employment are factory shop floors, materials handling, assembly lines, production processes, finalising goods, and other inbound and outbound logistical tasks. The basis for the IIoT phenomenon growth is the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which have currently been ensuring efficient work execution in many spheres, industrial as well as commercial and social. This chapter provides a discussion on IIoT concepts and definitions, on business drivers behind the growth of this technology, and the evolution process of this phenomenon. This contribution also discusses the fundamental underlying principles, related technologies, deployment approaches in different areas and associated frameworks. The chapter also explore Japanese Industry-specific case studies, where the industries have already been employing the IIoT-related practices. These include Zenitaka Corporation, Tsuchiya-Gousei, Toyota and Hitachi. This book chapter provides a broader overview in crystal clear and sets the background for the rest of the chapters in this book.},

A digital twin, like a virtual prototype, is a dynamic digital representation of a physical system. However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter’s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system’s life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds.},

Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts. The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are presented along with a discussion of future directions.},

  abstract       = {With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.},

  abstract       = {The United Nations (UN) have formulated seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and thus, humans were trying to traverse the sustainable path. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged and forced out the ephemeral conventional approaches. Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.},

  abstract       = {Smart manufacturing systems are an attractive target for cyber attacks, because they embed valuable data and critical equipment. Despite the market is driving towards integrated and interconnected factories, current smart manufacturing systems are still designed under the assumption that they will stay isolated from the corporate network and the outside world. This choice may result in an internal architecture with insufficient network and system compartmentalization. As a result, once an attacker has gained access, they have full control of the entire production plant because of the lack of network segmentation. With the goal of raising cybersecurity awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study showing attack scenarios that we have validated on a real modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical security counter measures. The testbed smart manufacturing system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory hosted by Politecnico di Milano, and comprises seven assembly stations, each with their programmable logic controllers and human-computer interfaces, as well as an industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place tasks. On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a system not directly connected to any public network. We conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an adversary can use to cause physical impact on the production, or keep persistent access to the plant. We are unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the premises of a research facility, following a scientific methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a good first step to inspire follow up research on the many verticals that we touch.},

We outline the unique set of challenges we must address if we are to attain a level of trust that will be required for a robust deployment of an IoT. We discuss the role of standards and how we can maximize the effectiveness of standards and device and service certification. We suggest a set of solutions for trust management that can support the unique security, safety, and privacy requirements of a robust IoT. Prominent among these solutions is the use of an older approach for access control, viz. the reference monitor, and blockchain technologies that can record trust and policy graphs and trust-related attributes for IoT devices and supporting services. An open, but governed trust blockchain can serve as a universal trusted oracle.},

This evolution imposes many challenges to the operation of the network, which then calls for new control and operation paradigms. Among others, a so-called grid-edge control is emerging to harmonise the coexistence of the grid control system and DER’s autonomous control. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the grid-edge control with various control architectures, layers, and strategies. The challenges and opportunities for such an approach at the grid edge with the integration of DERs and digital transformation are summarised. The potential solutions to support the network operation by using the inherent controllability of DER and the availability of the digital transformation at the grid edges are discussed.},

Previous research identifies that shadow IT is often collaborative systems used by employees to collaborate, communicate, and share content with coworkers, clients, or external partners. Based on these previous findings, we propose that shadow IT usage may positively influence organizational knowledge sharing (KS), which is central to knowledge management practices. Thus, this research aims to (1) identify the types and occurrences of shadow IT used by employee in the workplace, (2) investigate how KS (donation and collection) occurs via shadow IT, and (3) investigate how shadow IT influences KS. This is an exploratory study based on a qualitative approach. We performed interviews with IT users to answer the research question. Our findings identify that most of the interviewees use collaborative systems and mobile devices unauthorized by the IT department to share knowledge and communicate with their coworkers. The most common IT cited are WhatsApp and Skype, as well as solutions to store and share content, like Google Drive. In addition, several employees reported using shadow IT mainly because organizations do not provide suitable tools to communicate efficiently. We conclude that shadow IT can facilitate KS, primarily when people are geographically distributed since these unauthorized systems provide real-time communication. Our theoretical contribution is to expand current knowledge about shadow IT and reinforce the importance and prevalence of informal and decentralized KS within organizations. As for the practical implications, our article can help IT managers to better understand the usage of shadow IT and how they can balance the risk and benefits of this phenomenon.},

  abstract       = {Blockchain is becoming a widespread digital technology that allows every transaction to be tracked in an inviolable way, hence making it possible to go back through the entire history of products and product components. Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure.},

  abstract       = {The role of enterprise information systems is becoming increasingly crucial for improving customer responsiveness in the manufacturing industry. However, manufacturers engaged in mass customization are currently facing challenges related to implementing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concepts of Industry 4.0 in order to increase responsiveness. In this article, we apply the findings from a two-year design science study to establish the role of manufacturing execution systems/manufacturing operations management (MES/MOM) in an IIoT-enabled brownfield manufacturing enterprise. We also present design recommendations for developing next-generation MES/MOM as a strong core to make factories smart and responsive. First, we analyze the architectural design challenges of MES/MOM in IIoT through a selective literature review. We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM. The results from our QFD analysis indicate that interoperability is the most important characteristic when designing a responsive smart factory, with the highest relative importance of 31% of the eight characteristics we studied.},

  abstract       = {Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360 degrees camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360 degrees live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360 degrees web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.},

While some of these videos are humorous and benign, the majority of them are pornographic. The faces of celebrities and other well-known (and lesser-known) individuals have been superimposed on the bodies of porn stars. The existence of this technology erodes trust in video evidence and adversely affects its probative value in court. This article describes the current and future capabilities of this technology, stresses the need to plan for its treatment as evidence in court, and draws attention to its current and future impact on the authentication process of video evidence in courts. Ultimately, as the technology improves, parallel technologies will need to be developed and utilised to identify and expose fake videos.},

  abstract       = {The internet of things (IoT) and digital platforms have offered industrial companies new opportunities to compete against digital platform-native companies. To succeed in this competition, industry incumbents must learn to extend their traditional product and service business through platforms. However, extant research has focused primarily on the ability of platform owners to govern mature platforms for innovation but has largely ignored how industry incumbents can build these capabilities internally during the establishment of their platform ecosystems as part of larger transformational journeys. To address this gap, we conduct a multiple case study of three incumbent organizations, drawing on a dynamic capability lens. We identify 11 practical microfoundations of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities that aided three incumbents in establishing their IoT platform ecosystems. Besides the transformational activities, our findings contribute to the literature on platform establishment through three IoT-related shifts that deviate from known digital platform paradigms.},

  abstract       = {Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical necessity, with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance functions and vehicular communications. These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge.},

Disruptive technologies have the potential to advance the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase in different application fields. With the increasing industry interest, there is a need to review the current status of research developments in FM. In this review, 70 journal articles published from 2011 to 2020 were reviewed. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the applications of disruptive technologies for FM, analyse research trends and identify research gaps and potential future research directions. This article focuses on only academic articles including topics, such as operations and maintenance, information management, emergency management and energy management. Eventually, it is hoped that this review will provide researchers with clarity of where research endeavours are most needed and helpful insights to address FM challenges.},

However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.},

It is a complex issue, especially for great enterprises, because it requires an interdisciplinary approach. The kinds of problems enterprises must deal with and this domain complexity induces misinterpretations and misunderstandings about the concepts and relations in question. This article focus on dealing with Cybersecurity from an ontological perspective. The first contribution is a search of previously existing works that have defined Cybersecurity Ontologies. The paper describes the process to search these works. The second contribution of the paper is the definition of characteristics to classify the papers of Cybersecurity Ontologies previously found. This classification aims to compare the previous works with the same criteria. The third contribution of the paper is the analysis of the results of the comparison of previous works in the field of Cybersecurity Ontologies. Moreover, the paper discusses the gaps found and proposes good practice actions in Ontology Engineering for this domain. The article ends with some next steps proposed in the evolution towards a pragmatic and iterative solution that meets the needs of organizations.},

The paper focuses on 4.0 technologies that are used in chain management and the benefits they bring. They are an integral part of Economy 4.0. The considerations aim to define the 4.0 supply chain, to indicate the interest in particular technologies in quantitative terms, to identify the benefits of their implementation, to identify the most frequently related keywords, and to propose directions for further research.

Research has shown, among other things, that there is a need to identify factors that delay the digitalization of supply chains.

In the area of quantitative research, among other things, the productivity of leading authors and scientific centres, which most often take up the topics from SC 4.0, was presented. Bibliometric analysis in relation to generated records were used as a research method.},

Societal, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainability have become increasingly important design criteria in developing future technologies, along with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework that sets specific goals and targets to be achieved by 2030. The role of mobile communications is important in supporting nations and organizations in meeting the UN SDGs in a timely manner, but the whole ICT sector itself, with its critical role as the backbone of society, can create a significant sustainability burden. Research on the next-generation mobile communication networks (6G) has started, aiming at first deployments in 2030, in a new era where sustainability defines its development. Therefore, sustainability, especially through the UN SDGs, and the future 6G wireless networks, cannot be treated in isolation, but a clear connection between them is urgently needed. This paper extends from traditional green communications and energy efficiency considerations in wireless communications to establishing a close connection between 6G and the triple bottom line of economic sustainability, societal sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The paper outlines open research challenges for sustainable 6G development and provides a set of research questions encouraging especially the researchers and engineers in the wireless and mobile communications community to address to realize a sustainable future.},

Their critical analysis in terms of regional scalability is provided. The authors present the approach to building the digitalization index of Russian regions. The index measures the level of digitalization in a region by 48 parameters, grouped into three main groups: “perception of the processes of digital transformation of the subject of the Russian Federation, “preparedness of the digital environment, and “effects of digital transformation for the economy and social sphere of the region. The rating provides monitoring, evaluation of development, manageability, efficiency, and effectiveness in the context of interests and involvement of the main participants in the digital transformation process. The main participants in the digital transformation process are the following: authorities (states); representatives of the business community; citizens of the Russian Federation. A feature of the proposed approach is the accounting, when determining subject areas and composition of indicators and strategic priorities of Russia in the field of digitalization. The authors assume that the Index will be used by regional authorities to specify the provisions of regional projects conducted in the framework of federal projects of the national program “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation. Furthermore, the Index will be used to monitor its progress in the field of digital development and analyze problematic issues in the implementation of the digitalization strategy in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.},

Product-centric approaches that present effective solutions in tightly integrated environments have been problematic to deploy across multiple industries and over longer timespans. Addressing deployment costs, incentives, and governance, this paper explores a blockchain-based approach for the deployment of product-centric information systems. Through explorative design science and systematic combining, the deployment of a permissionless blockchain system for collecting product life-cycle data is conceptualized, demonstrated, and evaluated by experts. The purpose of the blockchain-based solution is to manage product data interactions, to maintain an accurate single state of product information, and to provide an economic incentive structure for the provision and the deployment of the solution. The evaluation by knowledgeable researchers and practitioners identifies the aspects limiting blockchain-based deployment of solutions in the current industrial landscape. Combining theory and practice, the paper lays the foundation for a blockchain-based approach to product information management, placing design priority on inter-industrial and self-sustained deployment.},

  abstract       = {Urbanization and the growth of human population are leading to increased complexities in the interactions of citizens with public spaces, creating cities that must be more responsive to community dynamics. Despite the critical need for community-based city management, current decision-making approaches are often uninformed by the collective behavior of communities across time and in different locations. Here, we introduce a computer vision-based monitoring and forecasting approach for Smart City Digital Twins (SCDT) that enables integrating collective behavior into the spatiotemporal assessments of exposure to urban heat stress. Our results from a pilot case study in the city of Columbus, GA, demonstrate the significance of integrating community dynamics into monitoring and forecasting urban hazard exposure. This ongoing study highlights how SCDT can make community dynamics more accessible to and responsive by city managers.},

Computational modelling is a powerful tool for energy analysis within the manufacturing industry as an effective decision making technique in order to optimise throughput, effectively plan and manage operations, reduce bottlenecks and test various scenarios. This study reviewed methodologies and frameworks developed for analysing energy consumption on a machine process level. Multi-level holistic analysis allowing for consideration of individual machines, the manufacturing process chain and built environment, with both discrete event and continuous based simulation are also presented. The requirement of a complete, high accuracy computational model is highlighted in order to understand the interaction between all relevant material, energy and resource flows. Challenges associated with achieving a holistic simulation of the manufacturing facility with all relevant parameters is presented, along with areas for further development. Furthermore, the development of Industry 4.0 is reviewed, along with new and emerging technologies allowing for increased automation, connectivity and flexibility within manufacturing, as well as visual techniques to provide further understanding and clarity of manufacturing processes such as digital twins, virtual and augmented reality.},

  abstract       = {The Blockchain is a novel technology with a wide range of potential industrial applications. Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less ``digital twins″ for industrial IOT applications.

  abstract    = {The advancement of technology and information access has lowered threat barriers, and security challenges are diffusing across all domains, many of which have not been designed to be secure for current and future vulnerabilities. In addition to others, there are many gaps in current systems engineering (SE) security design processes, and there is a need to reevaluate how we design systems in response to real and potential security threats. Systems that were developed without any consideration of operational threats now are being disrupted, and systems are being used by threat actors in ways that were never intended uses of the system. Thus the consideration of system response to threats in the development phase has become a necessary process across many domains that have no experience with safe and secure design strategies. Uncertainty and rapid change in the threat environment and future threat scenarios prevent a requirements-driven and model-based design process that produces dynamic design strategies and solutions. Future systems need to be designed for agility in response to context-driven changes, resilience to threat intrusions and cascading failure modes, and the ability to gracefully degrade and/or self-heal in response to unintended use. Methods and tools must support greenfield (new) and brownfield (existing) implementations.

Through a series of workshops organized by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) that brought together distinguished systems engineering researchers and professionals from across the United States, this paper documents the identification and synthesis of research gaps in the area of systems engineering as related to security and safety. These include research needs related to improved system protection; agility and adaptation; modeling and simulation of systems that reflect the adaptive behavior of internal and external actors; SE methods and tools that are self-descriptive and capture real-world information/data; tools that infer potentially unsafe, vulnerable, and/or non-secure implementations; mechanisms for self-governance and self-healing; and an ethics framework for design trades. From these gaps and related future needs, relevant stakeholders and preliminary research topics and threads are identified, and a roadmap is put forward for future research to address these Grand Challenges.},

  abstract       = {The current wave of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is reshaping the manufacturing sector with system interoperability, remote real-time process monitoring and advanced analytics. As digitally enabled manufacturing machines continue to grow exponentially, it becomes imperative to uniquely and securely identify them in the cyber-physical world, particularly in defense, biomedical, energy and aerospace manufacturing. Research about threats originating from internal adversaries’ i.e the machine/organization owner within a tiered digitally connected supply chain is scarce. This paper introduces a machine fingerprinting scheme named as the ‘Witness Box Protocol’ (WBP) that exploits the physical properties of manufacturing machines (legacy or smart) and their surroundings to create a unique biometric like fingerprint. WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. In this research, fingerprints were randomly generated from the statistical features of signals from 3D printers and CNC machine in a production-like lab environment. Using k-means clustering and Jaccard similarity index, these fingerprints are shown to identify the source equipment with 95 % accuracy.},

Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.},

  abstract       = {Considering the nascent application of advanced technologies in industry within the context of the new industrial revolution, we propose a methodology for identification and design (ID) of smart operations in manufacturing. The ID study considers the elements of the Industry 4.0 (I4) such as autonomous robots, advanced analytics, systems integration, high-end sensing, big data, internet of things, cloud computing and human-machine interactions. Toward achievable I4-based production, the proposed IDoI4 (ID-of-I4) approach integrates I4 fundamental elements regarding a) modelling and solution algorithms (MSA), b) information and communication technologies (ICT), c) high-performance computing (HPC), and d) mechatronics (MEC). These four groups of the I4 elements are examined in the industrial cases covering from mature industries to laboratory level systems to determine their current technological states and gaps into the I4 stage. The examples highlighted are crushed-ore stockpile level control in the mining field, resin bed cleaning timetabling in water demineralisation treatment, compositional data-driven real-time optimisation of hydrocarbon streams and diverse I4 basics in the next generation of biorefineries. In the main example, supported by a high-end sensing apparatus to measure crushed-ore stockpile levels in real-time (live inventory as a controlled variable by a target), a hybrid dynamic control prescribes (every 4 minutes) discrete positions and time-slots of the shuttle-conveyor tripper car mechatronics that creates the stockpiles. From such IDoI4 methodology, a table on the MSA, ICT, HPC and MEC ground bases summarises how such technologies are integrated to the industrial examples considering research, development and deployment in stable, demanded and highly demanded stages of the technologies into the I4 mandate.},

  abstract       = {Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.},

In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.},

Part of this vision was to digitize design and manufacturing systems and processes, aimed at advancing their vertical and horizontal integration into decentralized ecosystems across the entire product development value chain. This process was to include the provision of new data-driven operation and business models, advances in cybersecurity, and the development of a bespoke Industry 4.0 workforce. In this paper, the authors review the state-of-the-art in regard to the progress made to date, from initial vision towards implementation in industry. They identify critical research challenges and gaps that need to be addressed to further advance this transition. The paper closes with a strategic perspective on how the authors anticipate Industry 4.0 to evolve over the next 5 years.},

  abstract    = {Malware analysis is fundamental for defending against prevalent cyber security threats, and requires a means to deploy and study behavioural software traits as more sophisticated malware is developed. Traditionally, virtual machines are used to provide an environment that is isolated from production systems so as to not cause any adverse impact on existing infrastructure. Malware developers are fully aware of this and so will often develop evasion techniques to avoid detection within sandbox environments. In this paper, we conduct an investigation into anti-evasion malware triggers for uncovering malware behaviours that may act benign when they detect a traditional sandbox environment. To facilitate our investigation, we developed a dynamic sandbox reconfiguration tool called MORRIGU that couples together both automated and human-driven analysis for anti-evasion configuration testing, along with a visual analytics view for examining system behaviours and performing comparative analysis. Our study reveals a variety of anti-evasion traits that are shared amongst different malware families, such as sandbox `wear-and-tear&amp;rsquo;, and Reverse Turing Tests (RTT), as well as more sophisticated malware samples that require multiple anti-evasion checks to be deployed. Using a systematic testing approach such as MORRIGU enables test coverage of anti-evasion methods, whilst also offering flexibility for further human-driven analysis of additional evasion methods. We also perform a comparative study against automated analysis using Cuckoo sandbox to show that automated scoring alone can not reliably inform on the presence of evasive malware, hence requiring a more sophisticated anti-evasive testing approach. With a greater understanding of anti-evasion malware triggers and with appropriate tools to explore these in an effective and efficient manner, this study helps to advance research on how evasive malware is being utilised to evade analysis so that we can better defend against future attacks.},

Usually, only one or two devices are given to the testers, but hundreds or thousands are needed to really test IoT effects. This proposition makes IoT Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) cost and management prohibitive. One possible approach is to develop a digital twin of the IoT device and employ many replicas of the twin in a simulation environment comprised of various simulators that mimic the IoT device's operational environment. Cyber attack experimentation is a critical aspect of IoT T&amp;E and without such a virtual T&amp;E environment, it is almost impossible to study large scale effects. This paper will present a digital twin engineering methodology as applicable to IoT device T&amp;E and cyber experimentation.},

  abstract    = {Summary Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are hybrid systems comprising multiple components and many other combinations of various integrated but heterogeneous computational and physical capabilities. Todays embedded system such as iPhones and smart watches have integrated hardware and software solutions. There are engineering methodologies available to develop such embedded systems, focusing on the system. While their use at a personal level is much understood, what is less understood, and a topic of ongoing research is the question of what happens when such systems are deployed across multiple sectors, such as intelligent transportation systems, Internet of Things, smart medical devices, and many more, and used in activities not originally intended by the designers, for example, controlling the physical devices such as an automobile or an electricity power generation plant. This cross-sector deployment and the collective use of such systems introduces risk at the macro-system level that may have cascaded impacts in a highly networked environment, which further impact the constituent systems themselves. This is a major problem. One possibility to reduce the technical risk is to remotely control the systems in the cyber environments, but the sheer number of variables and possible situations introduce complexity at multiple scales. This complexity results in test plans with limited coverage. Additional cyber physical system related issues of intelligence, adaptation, autonomy, and security make the problem even worse. The proposed solution is the enhanced use of Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The M&S discipline has supported the development of complex systems since its inception. This chapter provides an overview on the M&S methods and technologies that aid CPS engineering in the development and testing phases, and CPS governance when they are deployed in complex cyber environments.},

The popular yet relatively poorly recognized scientific concept revolutionizes production strategies of enterprises. This prompts many researchers to analyze the real status of knowledge using a systematic literature review. In contrast to the available foreign publications, the existing analysis shows the lack of an analogous outcome on the domestic market. A systematic review of the literature made it possible to answer the following questions: (1) How widespread is the concept of Industry 4.0 in the Polish literature? (2) Which of the mentioned areas of the Industry 4.0 concept are particularly eagerly explored by researchers in Poland? (3) What research directions should the scientists focus on in the future? The conducted research resulted in findings regarding the current state of knowledge about Industry 4.0 in Polish conditions and indication of future research directions.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Nowadays, many complex multi-vendor production environments, such as telecom infrastructures in smart cities or on-board passenger information systems in trains, are based on micro-services and deployed in the cloud. From a service integrator viewpoint, building new solutions for these environments, which can host a large number of externally designed and developed micro-services, is often complex and error-prone. This is in part due to undocumented behaviour or undocumented architectural specifications of such systems. Advanced service monitoring can offer a solution to quickly detect anomalies or unexpected service interaction behaviour during on-site integration. However, the monitoring service should not have an impact on the production environment itself. Therefore, this article proposes an agent-based unobtrusive monitoring platform, capable of monitoring both internally developed and externally developed services through the use of sidecar containers. It monitors state, metrics and network traffic at micro-service level and the research was conducted as part of the DynAMo research project, a collaboration with various industry partners. Prototype evaluation proves that our solution has a negligible impact (below 0.02% CPU usage on average) on an existing micro-service environment just as other monitoring systems like Prometheus while offering additional functionality focused on multi-vendor service integration. This makes it suitable to be deployed in complex production domains to further aid on-site integration and quickly find potential new anomalies.},

  abstract       = {The Covid-19 pandemic has been the center of human existential chaos throughout the world, which also has affected the manufacturer in an extraordinary and unexpected way. With the decline in demand, supply, and workforce the industries are driven into the gloom. The concerned research objective is to explore the factors which impact manufacturing throughout the world during the epidemic of Covid-19. Further, it delineates the usage of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), and internet of things (IoT) to bring on solutions/approaches to evolving to pandemic-constrained manufacturing. An overall of twelve key factors is determined from extensive literature reviews which are categorized into challenges and solutions. Here, ISM methodology has been used to establish the interrelationship among identified twelve challenges and solutions. Further, MICMAC analysis has categorized them according to their driving and dependence power. The consequences display the absence of autonomous factors whilst efficient supply chain, centralized decision making, product diversification, and JIT along with revenue generation turn out to be significant dependant factors. The facilitators like digital technologies are the pre-cursors to the ultimate solution of revenue generation and termed preliminary solutions. The outcomes of this research will suggest eventual policy recommendations for industry leaders to progress manufacturing within Covid-19 constraints. It will offer a sturdy base for manufacturers around the world to tune to the new digital transformation of the production scenario.},

The main lesson learned was the organization's inability to strictly adhere to DevSecOps principles resulted in a dysfunctional software development environment and a reduced security posture.},

  abstract       = {We are witnessing an industry change which is transitioning to a more intelligent (or smarter) water network. In the UK a 5-year planning period and investment cycle called the Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the regulatory mechanism. This process is used to manage a water utility’s infrastructure and other assets to deliver an agreed standard of service. The challenge of AMP 6 and 7 (to 2025) and beyond is to maximise efficiency by moving from reactive to proactive management. This can be achieved by using data, information and (where possible) control of the system. The more intelligence that is captured, the more that can be learned and understood about the network and subsequently be predicted. Extra data provides new opportunities for asset maintenance and event analytics. Data science is an emerging discipline which combines analysis, programming and business knowledge and uses new and advanced techniques and technologies to work with complex data. The water sector needs to address the issue of ‘big data’ and obtaining ‘signal from the noise’. Primarily, the focus is on data to action by the application of data science.

The role of digitalisation for smart water networks is covered in this chapter, exploring issues of IoT, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other novel technologies. Reference to case studies demonstrates the type of applications which will become increasingly common place. Some recommendations based on future possibilities and opportunities are proposed.},

However, the connectivity of many stand-alone IoT systems through the Internet introduces numerous cybersecurity challenges as sensitive information is prone to be exposed to malicious users. This paper focuses on the improvement of IoT cybersecurity from an ontological analysis, proposing appropriate security services adapted to the threats. The authors propose an ontology-based cybersecurity framework using knowledge reasoning for IoT, composed of two approaches: (1) design time, which provides a dynamic method to build security services through the application of a model-driven methodology considering the existing enterprise processes; and (2) run time, which involves monitoring the IoT environment, classifying threats and vulnerabilities, and actuating in the environment ensuring the correct adaptation of the existing services. Two validation approaches demonstrate the feasibility of our concept. This entails an ontology assessment and a case study with an industrial implementation.},

Additionally, there are numerous circumstances where security, privacy, and limitations pertaining to the accessibility of the required equipment make it arduous to validate computer vision systems with real-world datasets. In this paper, we investigated the possibilities of using synthetic datasets, generated from Virtual Environments (VE) for training and validation of CNN models. We present two use cases where the above-mentioned circumstances play a vital role in preparing the datasets and validating the model with large-scale datasets. By developing and leveraging a three-dimensional Digital Twin (DT), we produce large scale datasets for validating social distancing in workspaces; and in the context of semi-autonomous vehicles, we evaluate how a CNN-based object detection model would perform in an Indian road scenario.},

Therefore, scalable methods for verifying security properties of manufacturing systems are paramount. This paper presents an approach to guarantee security of C2PS using concepts from Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to describe the security properties of cloud constructs. We prove that composability is an essential property for enhancing the security of the C2PS. Furthermore, it also provides good scalability to the system. We propose formalisms required for modelling security properties in the Industrial IoT-based manufacturing system. Using this formalism and Hoares’ logic we provide conditions for composing systems. Finally, we provide strong authentication conditions among entity pairs in C2PS based manufacturing systems. We demonstrate the message exchanges, methodology, and different steps required for verifying C2PS.},

  abstract       = {The construction industry has traditionally been characterised by the high diversity of its agents and processes, high resistance to change and low incorporation of technology compared to manufacturing industries. However, the construction sector is experiencing now a strong renovation process in methodology and tools due to the incorporation of the Building Information Modelling, Lean Construction and Integrated Project Delivery. Meanwhile, in production systems, “Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm that proposes automation, monitoring, sensorisation, robotisation, and digitalisation to improve production and distribution processes. In this context, some authors have proposed the concept of “Construction 4.0 as the counterpart of Industry 4.0 for the construction sector, although the methodological-technological implications are not clear. This research shows a methodological-technological framework adapted to the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations industry. This papers includes a detailed proposal for a reference frameworks and related technologies that could impact on this sector, responding to its complexities and specific challenges, such as the unique spaces for each work, which are difficult to standardise, arbitrary cost overruns and a productivity far below the average for other industries, increasing competitiveness and globalisation, as opposed to its traditionally local deployment, and an increasing demand to reduce the carbon footprint for all its activities.},

  abstract       = {The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin—a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system’s performance.},

  abstract       = {In the age of Big Data, the amount of data-driven research activities has increased significantly. However, when it comes to collaborative data processing in scientific workflows, provenance information of the used data is not always accessible. Especially in complex data ecosystems with multiple decentralized data sources, it is hard to keep track of the processing operations once they are completed. When sharing such data between different researchers and other involved parties, poor traceability of processing steps may also obstruct this process. In this paper, we introduce a blockchain based data provenance information system, which enables decentralized sharing of this information. We then integrate this system into the decentralized data sources context and address trust and traceability issues in the network with an identity-based solution. Furthermore, the system’s performance is evaluated, and the concept is examined in a case study on the e-Maritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR).},

Shoe production is a prime example of this; foot size, footstep pressure and personal preferences can be used to design personalized shoes. Research done around metamaterials, programming materials and computational composites illustrate the possibilities of creating complex data &amp; material relationships. These new relationships allow us to look at future products almost like software apps, becoming a kind of product service systems, where the focus is on its iterative personalization improvement over time. Can we create systems of such data driven objects that in turn allow us to design new objects that are informed by the data trail? In this paper we report on four RtD project iterations that explore this challenge and provide a set of insights on how to close this new iterative loop.},

  abstract       = {Advances in Information Technology and Communications are leading to a paradigm shift in manufacturing automation systems. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Technologies, manufacturing industries are witnessing the fourth Industrial Revolution, coined as Industrie 4.0 (I4.0). Although many studies related to this subject were published, including several literature reviews, there is no consensual definition of I4.0. Consequently, there is not a clear understanding of the underlying enabling technologies required to implement it. That makes it more difficult for players to plan a migration strategy. This paper proposes a technological pathway infrastructure from Industry 3.0 (I3.0) to I4.0, based on the analysis of research and academic involvement in this transition process. A bibliometric study was directed to academic work, while field research addressed industry practitioners. The purpose of field research is to understand the impact of the knowledge about the transition from I3.0 up to I4.0. The contribution of this study includes a construct showing the fundamental technology infrastructure to pave the way from I3.0 up to I4.0. Furthermore, it reveals the transition of manufacturing paradigm from I3.0 complex, centralized, monolithic architecture and physical Supply Chain to a modular, distributed, collaborative, and product-service-oriented I4.0 architecture.},

This article presents a scoping review of the literature on virtual reality-based training systems. The methodology consisted of four steps, which pose research questions, document search, paper selection, and data extraction. From a total of 350 peer-reviewed database articles, such as SpringerLink, IEEEXplore, MDPI, Scopus, and ACM, 44 were eventually chosen, mostly using the virtual reality haptic glasses and controls from Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE. It was concluded that, among the advantages of using this digital tool in the industry, is the commitment, speed, measurability, preservation of the integrity of the workers, customization, and cost reduction. Even though several research gaps were found, virtual reality is presented as a present and future alternative for the efficient training of human resources in the industrial field.},

This paper attempts to outline this challenge for blockchains as follows. It highlights blockchain scalability as a composite concept which can be interpreted in various ways i.e. expanding the number of participants of the network, or enhancing capabilities of the participants (such as processing, memory, storage or an efficient consensus strategy) to minimize the scalability overhead. Further, it presents a first thorough systemic study of existing efforts to achieve blockchain scalability with respect to; (i) innovative methods and mechanisms to strengthen blockchain’s capabilities with respect to scalability, (ii) approaches leveraging blockchains to achieve scalable applications, and (iii) efforts analyzing blockchain solutions with respect to scalability. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, the paper identifies contributions as well as open challenges which can help research community to advance knowledge within this domain.},

This may hinder the ability to collect good quality, well-lit, and occlusion-free imagery, which in turn, can lower the performance of computer vision models for fast and reliable object detection. In this paper, we propose and validate a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based generative adversarial network (GAN) trained and tested on construction site photos from two in-house datasets to increase image resolution by generating missing pixel information. Results show that using GAN-enhanced images can improve the average precision of pre-trained models for detecting objects such as building, equipment, worker, hard hat, and safety vest by up to 32% while maintaining the overall processing time for real-time object detection.},

Industry 4.0 has become an accepted trend across various industries, yet despite the increasing number of articles on this topic the complexities of implementation at the firm level remains largely vague and undefined. Therefore, the research presents a review of the social, operational and strategic aspects following the full-text mining of 116 selected articles. The study reveals that digital transformation requires stakeholders and investors to consider implementation through a multi-level and multidisciplinary lens. On this basis the study identifies the social, operational and strategic gaps within the literature and provides recommendations for future studies on implementation.},

In this context, there is a wide variety of European manufacturing initiatives addressing the challenges related to the implementation of the 4th industrial revolution principles and ideas, including digitalization and Zero-Defects Manufacturing (ZDM). Besides technical and organisational issues, standardization, in the context of next generation manufacturing systems, is a topic requiring better study. In this article we offer an analysis of relevant standards for manufacturing systems which was performed for the Digital Manufacturing Platforms (4DMP) cluster in order to identify those standards that might be relevant for ZDM, as well as for further projects or manufacturing platform designers. The standards covered by this work are aligned with the RAMI 4.0 reference model in order to simplify the design process by interlinking standards with relevant model layers and thus contribute to system's interoperability.},

Recent developments in scientometric analysis allow researchers to carry out complex bibliometric analyses coupled with an unstructured ontological discovery made available through thematic and ensuing semantic analyses to gain a holistic outlook on the ecosystem of Industry 4.0. The state-of-the-art review of the entire scholarship of Industry 4.0 demonstrates three broad clusters—the implications of automation on industry, the integration of technologies and technological advancements driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The scholarship output is, for the first time, compared with the leading industrial and policymaking institutional reports to highlight similarities and discrepancies. This allows to propose a previously unavailable definition of Industry 4.0, which is much needed to progress the research further. The three highly discrepant areas between academic literature and industry insights include lack of research into return on investment, lack of research involving policymaking, and the implications of technological development on the workforce, firms and countries. It is imperative to drive research into the existent, as well as the highlighted, themes in advancing the knowledge and aligning the academic scholarship with the interests of practitioners.},

These aspects are discussed, reflecting on the requirements of introducing such a technology in a broader way. Machine learning, as subfield of artificial intelligence, benefits from advances in Big Data science. One example is the   λ -architecture which can be used for the treatment of streamed process data in industrial applications. Digital twins are shown as further tool providing object-oriented data for machine learning applications. Yet, the increasing freedom of data transfer within a plant, as propagated by Industry 4.0, poses new risks for information technology and automation systems: security of those components is one of the big challenges. Here, artificial intelligence can seen as both risk and solution. A last relevant challenge is acceptance among the staff, as artificial intelligence is associated with fears. Counterstrategies for those fears are presented as a proposed guideline for real applications. Finally, current frontiers at process industry are considered and discussed. These include the need for strengthening the use of high-dimensional data availability, increased roll-out of optimisation concepts and rigorous progresses in semantic modelling of processes and process chains, in order to fully exploit the beneficial scope of artificial intelligence in industry.},

Although automation and assistance technologies are becoming more prevalent in production and logistics, there is consensus that humans will remain an essential part of operations systems. Nevertheless, human factors are still underrepresented in this research stream resulting in an important research and application gap. This article first exposes this gap by presenting the results of a focused content analysis of earlier research on Industry 4.0. To contribute to closing this gap, it then develops a conceptual framework that integrates several key concepts from the human factors engineering discipline that are important in the context of Industry 4.0 and that should thus be considered in future research in this area. The framework can be used in research and development to systematically consider human factors in Industry 4.0 designs and implementations. This enables the analysis of changing demands for humans in Industry 4.0 environments and contributes towards a successful digital transformation that avoid the pitfalls of innovation performed without attention to human factors. The paper concludes with highlighting future research directions on human factors in Industry 4.0 as well as managerial implications for successful applications in practice.},

Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones can be used to complete a wide range of different tasks from the military to the industry with numerous studies available in the literature. However, the broad use of drones for smart cities also faces several technical, societal issues such as cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety that need to be concerned. This chapter briefly provides a general overview of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks through a meta-analysis of relevant literature review towards drones such as Wi-Fi security, drone networking security, malicious software, and the like. Moreover, several countermeasures are explained in this chapter including detection methods and defense mechanisms to protect drones from their security vulnerabilities. Importantly, this paper raises cybersecurity awareness for users and presents solutions for future research in this area of interest. In fact, most cybersecurity vulnerabilities are based on sensors, communication links, and privacy via photos. Therefore, to ensure the security of drones, there is a need for a combination of the solutions for multiple sensors, the use of safe communication links instead of Wi-Fi, and the application of the CIA triad concepts.},

  pages = {108381},
  volume         = {244},
  abstract       = {Physical Internet (PI) is an open global logistics system of which components are hyperconnected for increased efficiency and sustainability. Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.},

  year  = {2022},
  pages = {103267},
  volume         = {199},
  abstract       = {It is essential to comprehend different aspects of performability of a system adopting Moving Target Defence (MTD) techniques. A number of previous works showed significant progress on security effectiveness evaluation for MTD mechanisms. While, a lesser amount of studies considered the impact of running MTD mechanisms on system dependability metrics, exposing a critical missing on the comprehension of pros and cons of MTD mechanisms in terms of security and dependability. In this paper, we present comprehensive modelling and analysis of time-based switch-over MTD strategies complying with IP shuffling techniques deployed in a Software Defined Network (SDN) using stochastic reward net (SRN). To investigate the impact of MTD strategies along with system availability on service performance metrics, we propose performability SRN models for various switch-over MTD strategies. The modelled behaviours of the switch-over MTD strategies are based on the integration of service management policies (drop/accept) with time-based switch-over policies (zero-time, fixed-time, and variable-time waiting policies) Critical performability metrics are comprehensively evaluated, including (i) system availability, downtime minutes, and Capacity-oriented Availability (COA) of a service, (ii) service throughput, (iii) response time of a job, (iv) average utilization of a server, (v) number of lost jobs, and (vi) operational cost (power consumption and business profit loss). The analysis results reveal sophisticated operational system behaviours and the impact of MTD strategies on system performability metrics. This study can help design and plan the development and adoption of MTD strategies in practice regarding the trade-offs between security and performability assurance.},

This places an increasing burden on automation developers, systems engineers and plant constructors. Intelligent assistance systems and smart automation systems are a possible solution to face this complexity: The machines, i.e. the software and assistance systems, take over tasks that were previously carried out manually by experts. At the heart of this concept are intelligent anomaly detection approaches based on models of the system behaviors. Intelligent assistance systems learn these models automatically: Based on data, these systems extract most necessary knowledge about the diagnosis task. This paper outlines this data-driven approach to plant analysis using several use cases from industry.},

Prior research provides a thorough view on data governance within a single organization. Although data sharing with partner organisations in data platforms provides a means to add data’s value, empirical studies addressing data governance in shared data platforms are still few. We propose a literature based preliminary framework for platform data governance with five domains: original data quality; ownership and access; stewardship; platform data quality and value of data usage. We report experiences from a European shipbuilding network, which is seeking ways to share data collected during ship’s operations. While the device manufacturers already process sensor data within their device-specific platforms, they are knowledgeable about potential benefits of sharing their data with others in the network. Based on interviews within the shipyard network, we report views along the five platform data governance domains.},

The present study develops an index of composite on-farm environmental impacts (COEI) as a proxy measure to evaluate ESA and validates the index by mapping interactions amongst agriculture related environmental impacts and potential constraints to practice ESA by using the directed graph approach. The cost of mitigation to practice ESA was calculated by estimating the cost of reducing on-farm environmental impacts by using the damage–cost method. The approach was empirically applied to a sample of 317 High Yielding Variety (HYV) rice farms from three intensive rice-growing regions of northwestern Bangladesh. Results showed that the use of chemical pesticides contributed towards higher level of uncertainty in practicing ESA than the use of chemical fertilizers, irrigation and household pollution. The combined effect of the influence from these factor interactions was estimated at 2.3, which falls in the critical region of influence and implies extreme level of uncertainty in practicing ESA. The cost of mitigating negative environmental impacts is higher for the problems of ‘decline in soil fertility’, ‘increases in crop diseases’ and ‘reduction in fish catch’ as compared to other soil and water related impacts. Policy implications include investments in addressing the problems of ‘soil fertility decline’, ‘increases in crop diseases’ and ‘reduction in fish catch’ and raising farmers’ awareness on using farm chemicals to promote ESA practices for HYV rice production.},

To address this need, we present an in-depth examination of a specific subset of virtualization artifacts in order to design and implement a method of mitigation that reduces the detectability of these artifacts. Our analysis compares the performance of a bare metal machine, a virtual machine without artifact mitigation, and a virtual machine with our proof-of-concept mitigation technique applied to a temperature sensor. Results of the implementation are analyzed to determine the potential impact on system performance and whether our mitigation technique is appropriate for extending high-fidelity hypervisors.},

  abstract       = {(1) Background: accident rates prove the uneven development of the member countries in the area of work safety. Remedial actions and structural programmes should take into account, e.g., the level of work safety in all European Union (EU) countries. Aim: the identification of differences in the level of work safety in the production sector of EU countries, especially the so-called “old and “new EU countries. (2) Methods: for each country UE (in 2008–2018), the relative risk (RR) of an accident at work was determined and a comparative analysis was conducted. (3) Results: an increase in the RR of an accident at work was observed along with an increase in the GDP of a given country. It was found that the level of occupational safety in Sweden and the United Kingdom is higher than in other countries, and lower in Spain and Portugal. In the three largest economies of the EU, Germany, France, and Italy, the RR of the accident in the industrial sector in relation to the national data is one of the lowest in the entire EU, not exceeding 1.3. In The Netherlands, an increase of 1.7 RR of fatal accidents in the industrial sector was observed between 2008 and 2018. (4) Conclusions: RR in the manufacturing sector of the so-called “old EU is higher than in the so-called “new EU, which may result from the implementation of Industry 4.0 assumptions in the “old EU. The presented results and conclusions may be useful in shaping the EU policy in the field of sustainable development of production sectors of individual member countries.},

  abstract       = {Prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a crucial aspect of the management of engineering systems and structures, where sensor hardware and decision support tools are deployed to detect anomalies, diagnose faults and predict remaining useful lifetime (RUL). Methodologies for PHM are either model-driven, data-driven or a fusion of both approaches. Data-driven approaches make extensive use of large-scale datasets collected from physical assets to identify underlying failure mechanisms and root causes. In recent years, many data-driven PHM models have been developed to evaluate system’s health conditions using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to condition monitoring data. The field of AI is fast gaining acceptance in various areas of applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and smart devices. With advancements in the use of AI technologies in Industry 4.0, where systems consist of multiple interconnected components in a cyber–physical space, there is increasing pressure on industries to move towards more predictive and proactive maintenance practices. In this paper, a thorough state-of-the-art review of the AI techniques adopted for PHM of engineering systems is conducted. Furthermore, given that the future of inspection and maintenance will be predominantly AI-driven, the paper discusses the soft issues relating to manpower, cyber-security, standards and regulations under such a regime. The review concludes that the current systems and methodologies for maintenance will inevitably become incompatible with future designs and systems; as such, continued research into AI-driven prognostics systems is expedient as it offers the best promise of bridging the potential gap.},

Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user’s behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data—Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer—are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable.

Among many benefits, C-CNC allows manufacturing machines to leverage advanced control algorithms running on cloud computers to boost their performance at low cost, without need for major hardware upgrades. However, a fundamental challenge of C-CNC is how to guarantee safety and reliability of machine control given variable Internet quality of service (e.g. delays), especially on public Internet networks. We propose a three-tier redundant architecture to address this challenge. We then prototype tier one of the architecture on a 3D printer successfully controlled via C-CNC over public Internet connections, and discuss follow-on research opportunities.},

On the other hand, cyberattacks are growing in all cyber-physical systems, and in the smart grid, cybersecurity is essential due to the smart grid is a critical infrastructure. This work shows a small implementation of a digital twin system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of digital twins is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid in particularly in cybersecurity testing},

The triggers stimulated by end-users interest have introduced the first generation of mass-consumer wearables in just the past decade. Evidently, the trailblazing ones were not designed with strict energy-consumption restrictions in mind. Thus, wearable-computing-related research remained fragmented. Advanced and sophisticated batteries and communication technologies could be already procurable on devices. Additional solutions for efficient utilization of processing power are still a white spot on the wearable technology roadmap. A-WEAR EU project aims to enhance the understanding of how the superimposition of those technologies would improve wearable devices' energy efficiency, with the research area being far from saturation. We foresee enormous room for research as the Edge computing paradigm is emerging towards hand-held devices.},

This paper makes an introduction to the challenges that come together with Industry 4.0 and proposes Process Mining techniques as a new approach for business process analysis in order to support companies to rapidly adapt to market changes by offering customized solutions for customers. The study provides a brief overview of Industry 4.0 and gradually introduces Process Mining as a purview of Industry 4.0. A case study approach is used to confirm the advantages brought by Process Mining. Different types of graphical visualization describing both control-flow and resource perspectives are also presented.},

The wide-scale proliferation of sensors coupled with the implementation of embedded computational intelligence algorithms can help to tackle many of the technical challenges associated with this energy systems integration problem. Nonetheless, barriers still exist, as suitable methods are needed to handle complex networks of actors, often with competing objectives, while determining design and operational decisions for systems across a wide spectrum of features and time-scales. This review looks at the current developments in the smart energy sector, focussing on techniques in the main application areas along with relevant implemented examples, while highlighting some of the key challenges currently faced and outlining future pathways for the sector. A detailed overview of a framework developed for the EU H2020 funded Sharing Cities project is also provided to illustrate the nature of the design stages encountered and control hierarchies required. The study aims to summarise the current state of computational intelligence in the field of smart energy management, providing insight into the ways in which current barriers can be overcome.},

Automating the process of capturing data from industrial machines, analyzing it and using the knowledge gained to make better decisions for the machines is the crux of the digital twin. Sensor technology, Internet of Things platforms, information and communication technology and smart analytics allow the digital twin to transform a physical asset into a connected smart item that is now part of a cyber physical system and that is far more valuable than when it existed in isolation. The digital twin can be adopted by the maintenance engineering industry to aid in the prediction of issues before they occur thus creating value for the business. In this paper the authors look to introduce a maintenance digital twin to a large-scale manufacturing facility. Issues that hamper such work are discovered and categorized to highlight the difficulty of the practical installation of this concept. To aid in the installation process a digital twin framework is presented that simplifies the digital twin development process into steps that can be completed independently. With the framework in place the authors commence the task of completing these steps.},

  title = {Designing human–system cooperation in industry 4.0 with cognitive work analysis: a first evaluation},
  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {One objective of Industry 4.0 is to reach a better system performance as well as to have a better consideration of humans. This would be done by benefiting from knowledge and experience of humans, and balancing in a reactive way some complex or complicated tasks with intelligent systems. Several studies already dealt with such an objective, but few are done at a methodological level, which forbids, for example, the correct evaluation of design choices in terms of human awareness of the situation or mental workload when designing intelligent manufacturing systems integrating the human. Indeed, increasing the intelligence and autonomy of industrial systems and their composing entities (resources, products, robots…), as fostered by Industry 4.0, increases their overall complexity. This modification reduces the ability to understand the behaviors of these systems, and leads to the difficulty for humans not only to elaborate alternative decisions when required, but also to make effective decisions and understand their consequences. This paper evaluates such a design methodology, the Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), and its applicability when designing an assistance system to support Human in the control of Intelligent Manufacturing System in Industry 4.0. Among several functions identified through the application of CWA, the assistant system might have to integrate a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. The evaluation of the methodology through the one of the designed assistant systems is done using a micro-world, which is an intelligent manufacturing cell composed of intelligent mobile ground robots, products, and static production robots interacting together and with a human supervisor in charge of the reaching of several time-based and energy-based performances indicators. The assistant system embeds a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. Twenty-three participants took part in experiments to evaluate the designed assistance system. First results show that the assistance system enables participants to have a correct awareness of the situation and a correct evaluation of their alternative decisions, while their mental workload is managed and expected production performances are reached. This paper contains an analysis of these experiments and points out some limits of the CWA method in the context of Industry 4.0, especially the lack of tool enabling to specify clearly the cooperation processes between the supervisor and the intelligent manufacturing system. This paper concludes with potential research avenues, the main one being the potential benefits of coupling CWA with human–machine cooperation principles to fine tune and adapt the cooperation between the human and the intelligent manufacturing system.},

  abstract       = {The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.},

Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.},

Digital twin is an important element of the Industry 4.0 digitalization process; however, the huge amount of data that are generated and collected by a digital twin offer challenges in handling, processing and storage. The paper aims to report on the development of a new framework that combines the digital twin and digital thread for better data management in order to drive innovation, improve the production process and performance and ensure continuity and traceability of information. The digital twin/thread framework incorporates behavior simulation and physical control components, in which these two components rely on the connectivity between the twin and thread for information flow and exchange to drive innovation. The twin/thread framework encompasses specifications that include organizational architecture layout, security, user access, databases and hardware and software requirements. It is envisaged that the framework will be applicable to enhancing the optimization of operational processes and traceability of information in the physical world, especially in an Industry Shipyard 4.0.},

On the other hand, the world is witnessing and suffering due to technologically aided crime methods. These threats, including but not limited to hacking and intrusions and are the main concern for security experts. Nevertheless, the challenges facing effective intrusion detection methods continue closely associated with the researcher’s interests. This paper’s main contribution is to present a host-based intrusion detection system using a C4.5-based detector on top of the popular Consolidated Tree Construction (CTC) algorithm, which works efficiently in the presence of class-imbalanced data. An improved version of the random sampling mechanism called Supervised Relative Random Sampling (SRRS) has been proposed to generate a balanced sample from a high-class imbalanced dataset at the detector’s pre-processing stage. Moreover, an improved multi-class feature selection mechanism has been designed and developed as a filter component to generate the IDS datasets’ ideal outstanding features for efficient intrusion detection. The proposed IDS has been validated with state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems. The results show an accuracy of 99.96% and 99.95%, considering the NSL-KDD dataset and the CICIDS2017 dataset using 34 features.},

However, such a promising role of data analytics has been so far explored without a proper, quantitative inspection of the cost-improvement trade-off, nor has the process of acquiring sensors and extracting valuable information from their captured data formalized in a series of methodological steps. This paper introduces the Analyze, Sense, Preprocess, Predict, Implement and Deploy (ASPPID) methodology, an iterative decision workflow that spans from the acquisition of sensing equipment to the quantitative assessment of the contribution of their captured data to enhance the production step under focus. By placing the data scientist at the core of the workflow, this methodology helps improvement teams make informed decisions about which parts of the process need to be sensed, and how to exploit this information towards a verifiable improvement of the production cycle. The implementation of this methodology is exemplified in a real use case within the automotive industry, where the detection of defects in an annealing process can be modeled as a classification problem over a highly imbalanced dataset. Results obtained after applying the proposed ASPPID methodology show that the scrap ratio is reduced by sensing the correct part of the process at minimal investment costs, thus highlighting the crucial role of the data scientist in the management team of manufacturing plants.},

It comprises largely preliminary reports (results of excavations that took place up to and including August 2019 where possible) that complement the digital content made available through Archaeology in Greece Online ( https://chronique.efa.gr ). Due to the diachronic nature of a number of the sites and for ease of reference, the material is organized within each section geographically in the first instance and then chronologically (earliest to latest), as far as possible.},

  abstract       = {Due to the recent development of information and communication technology (ICT), various studies using real-time data are now being conducted. The microgrid research field is also evolving to enable intelligent operation of energy management through digitalization. Problems occur when operating the actual microgrid, causing issues such as difficulty in decision making and system abnormalities. Using digital twin technology, which is one of the technologies representing the fourth industrial revolution, it is possible to overcome these problems by changing the microgrid configuration and operating algorithms of virtual space in various ways and testing them in real time. In this study, we proposed an energy storage system (ESS) operation scheduling model to be applied to virtual space when constructing a microgrid using digital twin technology. An ESS optimal charging/discharging scheduling was established to minimize electricity bills and was implemented using supervised learning techniques such as the decision tree, NARX, and MARS models instead of existing optimization techniques. NARX and decision trees are machine learning techniques. MARS is a nonparametric regression model, and its application has been increasing. Its performance was analyzed by deriving performance evaluation indicators for each model. Using the proposed model, it was found in a case study that the amount of electricity bill savings when operating the ESS is greater than that incurred in the actual ESS operation. The suitability of the model was evaluated by a comparative analysis with the optimization-based ESS charging/discharging scheduling pattern.},

  abstract       = {This paper proposes a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based nonlinear integral backstepping (NIB) in combination with model free control (MFC) for pitch angle control of variable speed wind turbine. In particular, the controller has been presented as a digital twin (DT) concept, which is an increasingly growing method in a variety of applications. In DDPG-NIB-MFC, the pitch angle is considered as the control input that depends on the optimal rotor speed, which is usually derived from effective wind speed. The system stability according to the Lyapunov theory can be achieved by the recursive nature of the backstepping theory and the integral action has been used to compensate for the steady-state error. Moreover, due to the nonlinear characteristics of wind turbines, the MFC aims to handle the un-modeled system dynamics and disturbances. The DDPG algorithm with actor-critic structure has been added in the proposed control structure to efficiently and adaptively tune the controller parameters embedded in the NIB controller. Under this effort, a digital twin of a presented controller is defined as a real-time and probabilistic model which is implemented on the digital signal processor (DSP) computing device. To ensure the performance of the proposed approach and output behavior of the system, software-in-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) testing procedures have been considered. From the simulation and implementation outcomes, it can be concluded that the proposed backstepping controller based DDPG is more effective, robust, and adaptive than the backstepping and proportional-integral (PI) controllers optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances.},

The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners.},

By simulating the nominal behavior of the system online, i.e., in parallel to the process, and continuously comparing the simulated behavior to the measured values allows to detect attacks. Their localization is facilitated through a root-cause analysis, which is also based on the model description of the plant.

The feasibility and timing for successful adoption and implementation of such technology depend primarily on the readiness level and specific needs of each organisation, making it imperative to exercise insightful judgement as it can be expensive to acquire, develop and master. This research study examines the market pull versus technology push components of the functionalities enabled by digital SC control towers and buildings on the outcome of an extensive survey and expert interviews and proposes an assessment tool to aid decision making for the consideration of their adoption.},

Despite several advances in this domain, the literature still lacks a state-of-the-art review of simulation-based approaches in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This paper therefore aims to provide a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed publications between 2011 and 2018 in the field of modelling and simulation applied in Industry 4.0, with a focus on manufacturing and logistics systems. This review contributes to the literature in two significant ways. First, it provides a broad coverage of current publications on the theme by reviewing 112 papers, using a meta-analysis approach. Moreover, it presents a detailed evaluation of different elements from these publications, including research activities (application area, methods, frameworks and software tools), gaps and directions. Around 80% of the papers analysed were published in the last two years. Finally, the results suggest that the main simulation approaches used in Industry 4.0 are agent-based or mixed methods and identify Digital Twin (DT) as the most promising simulation technology.},

Its service-based approach enables collaboration and data exchange on higher level, with better efficiency and parallel decreasing costs. Also manufacturing environments can benefit from cloud technology and better fulfill fast changes in market demands, by applying diverse cloud deployment models and by virtualizing manufacturing processes and assets into services. As cloud becomes the basis of most innovative manufacturing IT systems, its future role in Cyber-physical Production Systems has to be properly investigated, as their interoperability will play a role of vital importance. In this paper, after a brief introduction to cloud criticality and cloud-based manufacturing, the mutual conceptual similarities in modelling distributed industrial services of two of the major standardization frameworks for industrial Internet architectures are presented: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) and the Reference Architectural Model Industrie (RAMI 4.0). It is also introduced how their integration feasibility finds a strong affinity in specifications of the Open Connectivity Unified Architecture, a service-oriented architecture candidate to the standardization of Industrial Internet of Things based manufacturing platforms. Finally, the preliminary architecture of a prototype Smart Factory is presented as a case study.},

In this effervescent, increasingly contended market environment, an extraordinary wealth of business opportunities opens up for companies of all sorts—from large energy firms to local utilities embarking on growth paths via alliances and aggregations, to startups and new entrants from side industries. After reviewing the key technologies impacting the sector and the main pillars of the EU energy policy, the paper delineates three macro-roles for future energy firms. It then stresses the function that smart grids, new digital capabilities, and market segmentation will have in redrawing the structure of the sector. Finally, it suggests that while a balanced mix of old and new technologies is likely to be around and even winning for some time to come, companies that resist innovation and change may soon find themselves as belonging to the past.},

Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing innovations both in technique and management-a ``continuous lifecycle integration″ method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and ``early movement″ of the general contractor, this paper reported a successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O&M phase up to the O&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.},

However, the impact of these transformations exceeds the production systems themselves; rather, they affect the entire value chain, from the product design and development process (PDDP) through manufacturing and supply-chain management to marketing and disposal. As the new PDDP to a large extent defines the value chain for a company, the challenge lies in ensuring that the designed product will help the company fully benefit from the IRs. By analysing the 4th IR, the authors reveal that few publications shed light on this aspect. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to establish features and properties that will shape the PDDP throughout the 4th IR and into a smart design engineering. To accomplish this, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature, which provides ten findings. These findings are then analysed by 11 specialists both from academia and the industry, and the findings’ relations to the 4th IR and their impact on the product development process is discussed. By establishing these findings, this paper provides a platform for the understanding of what could potentially shape smart design engineering and its design-related activities.},

The second approach follows a more futuristic approach, focusing on the potential development of autonomous, artificial democratic agents.

  abstract       = {Mass customized and mass personalized production has become facilitated by the fourth industrial revolution. The resulting industrial environments require the development of information systems able to take the specifications of customers and convey them to the production system in such a way as to contribute to the coordination of all the stakeholders and activities required to fulfill the orders of the customers. This is beyond the capabilities of traditional systems based on MRP and ERP, since the information should be managed in a flexible and decentralized way to exploit the Smart Manufacturing facilities of Industry 4.0. Blockchain, instead, is a technology that provides those features constituting a sound information supporting basis for mass customized/personalized production. Consequently, we explore the potential of blockchain as an information technology able to support industries that base their business models on mass customized/personalized production processes. This survey allows us to identify important challenges for further developments, highlighting three issues in the production setting: (i) to deepen the interoperability of systems, (ii) to generate more implementations, and (iii) to develop efficient consensus protocols. As a response to these insights we provide a conceptual design of how blockchain contributes to managing efficiently mass customized production systems. In our design the information of customer specifications can be fused with data from the production process to generate a plan to fulfill the demand. This design arises as a solution approach to three stated problem, which are faced by mass customized production systems.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Numerous statements and pamphlets indicate that governments should increase the transparency of ICT-implementations and algorithms in eGovernment services and should encourage democratic control. This paper presents research among civil servants, suppliers and experts who play a role in the automation of spatial policymaking and planning (e.g. environment, building, sound and CO2 regulation, mobility). The case is a major digitalisation programme of that spatial planning in the Netherlands. In this digital transition, the research assumption is that public and political values such as transparency, legitimacy and (perceived) fairness are difficult to validate in the practice of the design process; policy makers tend to lose sight of the algorithms and decision trees designed during the ICT -implementation of eGovernment services. This situation would implicate a power shift towards the system level bureaucrat. i.e., the digitized execution of laws and regulations, thereby threatening democratic control. This also sets the stage for anxiety towards ICT projects and digital bureaucracies. We have investigated perceptions about ‘validation dark spots’ in the design process of the national planning platform that create unintended shifts in decision power in the context of the legal planning process. To identify these validation dark spots, 22 stakeholders were interviewed. The results partially confirm the assumption. Based on the collected data, nine validation dark spots are identified that require more attention and research.},

The implementation of these CPSs creates several changes for companies’ operations that are expected to have a deep impact in human workers. A lack of studies on the social impact of the use of CPSs has been identified and, through a comprehensive literature review, this work aims at contributing for this discussion by defining a questionnaire about the topic. In the future, this questionnaire is intended to be sent to companies to collect data from their C-level managers about the use of CPSs applied to manufacturing.},

  abstract       = {The industrial scenario is undergoing exponential changes, mainly due to the different technologies that emerge quickly and the ever increasing demand. As a consequence, the number of processing devices and systems in the industries’ architectures is also increasing. Entities connectivity, physical/virtual joint functioning, interactivity, interoperability, self-organization, smart decision making, among other factors are fundamental to foster Industry 4.0 (I4.0) potential. We believe that Cyber Physical System (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will have a major role in the emerging I4.0. In this context, researchers and experts from major factories are exploring these technologies in order to keep up with this digital transformation, developing IIoT systems and CPS architectures capable of connecting network devices from different information and communications technologies (ICT) systems, virtualizing the companies’ assets and integrating them with other manufacturing sectors and companies. This article performs a survey covering the main CPS architecture models available in the industrial environment, emphasizing their key characteristics and technologies, as well as the correlations among them, pointing objectives, advantages and contribution for the IIoT introduction in I4.0. It also provides a literature review covering projects from CPSs and IIoT point-of-view, identifying main technologies employed in current state-of-the-art and how they can meet the I4.0 key features of vertical and horizontal industrial integration. Finally, the article points requirements for current and future challenges, limitations, gaps and necessary changes in the CPS architectures in order to improve and introduce them in the I4.0 scenario.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Industry 4.0 makes manufacturers more vulnerable to current challenges and makes it easier to adapt to market changes. This will increase the speed of innovation, make it more customer-oriented and lead to faster design processes. It is essential to focus on monitoring and controlling the production system before complex accidents occur. Moreover, an industrial control system facing information security problems in recent times because of the nature of IoT which affects the evaluation of abnormal predication. To overcome above research gaps, we shift to industrial 4.0 which combine IoT and mechanism learning for industrial monitor and manage. We propose a hybrid machine learning technique for IoT enabled industrial monitoring and control system (IoT-HML). Here, we concentrate both information security issues with accurate monitoring and control system. The first section of proposed IoT-HML system is to introduce the cat induced wheel optimization (IWO) algorithm for cluster formation. The process consists of clustering and cluster head (CH) selection. The source node forward information to destination through CH only which avoids the unwanted data loss and improve the security, because the information travel through trusted path. For route selection process, we utilize the cuckoo search algorithm to compute the optimal best path among multiples. In second section, we illustrate a coach and player learned neural network (CP-LNN) for monitoring the industrial and prevent from accidents by basic control strategies. Finally, the proposed IoT-HML system can evaluate with different set of data’s to prove the effectiveness.},

Besides, digitalization has brought a vast amount of information and data sources that MM may exploit to improve its processes and asset-related decision-making. This evolution of MM has brought a lot of opportunities but also various criticalities about information and data management. Data models are envisioned to provide significant support to this end. However, a common reference data taxonomy is needed for the correct development of data models. This work aims at exploring how the data taxonomy could help in addressing the current criticalities by synthesizing most information and data classes that support MM. The data taxonomy, along with other elements, like data models, effectively support companies in improving the management of their information and data. The usefulness of a data taxonomy is proved thanks to action research in a company within the automotive sector aiming at improving the MM process.},

Yet, its development still faces questions over impact, added value, or concrete paths for widespread deployment. In this paper we argue for a transdisciplinary forward-looking approach to address such uncertainties, based on the processes and findings of the research project #Blockchain4EU: Blockchain for Industrial Transformations, which was developed inside the European Commission with a focus on multi-stakeholder engagement and co-creation. We invested in a mix of desk research with qualitative methods, including interviews, surveys, or ethnographic explorations, together with participatory workshops for collective vision building and speculative prototyping for policy. Our main findings underline key sociotechnical challenges and opportunities for the development and uptake of Blockchain in specific European industrial and business contexts, taking into account the complexity of policy, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental elements. But, aiming to push the frontiers of what's common practice in advice for policy when looking into early-stage technologies as Blockchain, we also strive to emphasize how our approach can benefit decision-makers through robust methodological and conceptual processes that are simultaneously evidence-based and experimental in their delivery and impact.},

The high limits for accessing the energy markets and also for the delivery of ancillary services act as a barrier for small scale prosumers participation forcing the implementation of new cooperative business models at the local level. This paper is proposing a fog computing infrastructure for the local management of energy systems and the creation of coalitions of prosumers able to provide ancillary services to the grid. It features an edge devices layer for energy monitoring of individual prosumers, a fog layer providing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) techniques for managing local energy systems by implementing cooperative models, and a cloud layer where the service specific technical requirements are defined. On top, a model has been defined allowing the dynamical construction of coalitions of prosumers as Virtual Power Plants at the fog layer for the provisioning of frequency restoration reserve services while considering both the prosumers' local constraints and the service ones as well as the constituents’ profit maximization. Simulation results show our solution effectiveness in selecting the optimal coalition of prosumers to reliably deliver the service meeting the technical constraints while featuring a low time and computation overhead being feasible to be run closer to the edge.},

This paper introduces the feasibility study of a Dock to Dock (D2D) use case, combining aspects of route development and infrastructure definition, for the transport of goods in South West England and South Wales. The proposed system makes use of new, more flexible and environmentally friendly means of transport, such as electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft and electric Autonomous ZeroEmission (eAZE) vessels. To meet the environmental targets set out for the transport sector, the use of alternative hydrogen- based fuels is investigated for air, surface and marine vehicles. Logistics, regulations and infrastructure required for the safe and efficient production and distribution of such low-emission energy vectors is also considered. Digital twin of the system is proposed to study its safety and viability, while the analysis of energy requirements is proposed to inform policy makers and define the necessary infrastructure to meet future emission-free transport energy needs.},

Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. In this paper, we present SDCWorks---a modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It consists of the semantic structures for creating models, a baseline controller, and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator for SDCWorks models. We provide the semantics of such a manufacturing system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, and monitoring. We illustrate the expressive power of SDCWorks by modeling the realistic SMART manufacturing testbed of University of Michigan. We show how our open source SDCWorks simulator can be used to evaluate relevant metrics (throughput, latency, and load) for example manufacturing systems.},

Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.},

  abstract       = {Defending networks against cyber attacks is often reactive rather than proactive. Attacks against enterprises are often monetary driven and are targeted to compromise data. While the best practices in enterprise-level cyber security of IT infrastructures are well established, the same cannot be said for critical infrastructures that exist in the manufacturing industry. Often guided by these best practices, manufacturing enterprises apply blanket cyber security in order to protect their networks, resulting in either under or over protection. In addition, these networks comprise heterogeneous entities such as machinery, control systems, digital twins and interfaces to the external supply chain making them susceptible to cyber attacks that cripple the manufacturing enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse, comprehend and quantify the essential metrics of providing targeted and optimised cyber security for manufacturing enterprises. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to develop the essential metrics, namely, Damage Index (DI) and Vulnerability Index (VI) that quantify the extent of damage a manufacturing enterprise could suffer due to a cyber attack and the vulnerabilities of the heterogeneous entities within the enterprise respectively. A use case for computing the metrics is also demonstrated. This work builds a strong foundation for development of an adaptive cyber security architecture with optimal use of IT resources for manufacturing enterprises.},

The control technology to guide robotic movement has been developed using ACE controller instead of using any conventional controller. Emulation model has been developed in 3D Visualization using controller software. The entire model has been implemented in a workspace area of 980 mm x 910 mm. Moreover, production, quality, maintenance and managerial aspects has been taken into consideration along with data capturing from different location. The real implementation done has improved the process which was being done manually and it has shown its efficacy on the basis of cycle time reduction by 50%, accuracy being improved to 100% operating cost reduction by 60%. Moreover, this improved method has further led to quality improvement with satisfaction to customers through timely delivery, reduction in manual intervention and improved safety aspects.},

  abstract       = {Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) are complex, location-aware, networked systems of medical devices that can be used as a piece of the healing center to give the best medical care to patients. Hence, they integrate human, cyber, and physical elements. Since MCPSs are life-critical and context-aware, they are significant to the healthcare industry, which is prone to data breaches and cyber-attacks. As an emerging research area, MCPS faces several challenges with respect to system reliability, assurance, autonomy and security, and privacy. In this paper, we initially examine the state-of-the-arts of MCPS over the last few decades (1998–2020) and subsequently propose a new framework considering security/privacy for MPCS that incorporates several models that depict various domains of security. An interaction between various models followed with a qualitative assessment of the framework has been carried out to present a detailed description of the proposed framework. It is useful in various healthcare industries like health care services, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, etc. that utilize smart devices. Additionally, the framework may be applied to enhance security in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment.

We then show the effects on the conventional distance protection algorithm and give worst case estimates for the reduction of measured impedance in asymmetrical cases. Simulations using PSCAD and a Digital Twin of Siemens distance relays are presented to give a good assessment of relay behavior and protection security. Lastly, we discuss possible solutions like reduced zone-reach of phase-to-earth loops and use of reactance method.},

  abstract       = {Manufacturing companies across all major industries are facing serious challenges trying to competitively design and manage modern products, which are becoming increasingly complex multi-domain systems or “systems of systems. Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders’ needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.},

Big Data technologies play a significant role within IoT processes, as visual analytics tools, generating valuable knowledge in real-time in order to support critical decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visualization methods, tools, and techniques for the IoT. We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.},

The blockchain technology is supposed to solve many problems as it promises to save time, avoid costs, reduce risk, and increase trust among the participants. It leads to many approaches that enable tracking and tracing of goods in supply chains. We found out that the proposed solutions are unnecessarily complicated and that there was no defined process to introduce a blockchain-based tracing solution in companies using lean principles. Therefore, we utilized a value stream mapping approach to develop a simple tracing mechanism based on colored coins and show how they can be implemented in companies. The resulting tracing mechanism and implementation process were evaluated with the partners of a joint research project and showed excellent future development potential.},

As an important prerequisite for smart manufacturing, the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing is becoming more and more important. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and digital twin (DT) are the preferred means to achieve the interoperability and integration between the physical and cyber worlds. From the perspective of hierarchy, CPS and DT can be divided into unit level, system level, and SoS (system of system) level. To meet the different requirements of each level, the following three complementary technologies, i.e., edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing, are instrumental to accelerate the development of various CPS and DT. In this article, the perspectives of unit-level, system-level, and SoS-level of CPS and DT supported by edge computing, fog computing and cloud computing are discussed.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, artificial intelligence technologies have been widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, automatic driving, and other fields. However, artificial intelligence systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which limit the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in key security fields. Therefore, improving the robustness of AI systems against adversarial attacks has played an increasingly important role in the further development of AI. This paper aims to comprehensively summarize the latest research progress on adversarial attack and defense technologies in deep learning. According to the target model’s different stages where the adversarial attack occurred, this paper expounds the adversarial attack methods in the training stage and testing stage respectively. Then, we sort out the applications of adversarial attack technologies in computer vision, natural language processing, cyberspace security, and the physical world. Finally, we describe the existing adversarial defense methods respectively in three main categories, i.e., modifying data, modifying models and using auxiliary tools.},

  abstract       = {Buildings Automation Systems (BAS) are ubiquitous in contemporary buildings, both monitoring building conditions and managing the building system control points. At present, these controls are prescriptive and pre-determined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic, possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics, data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted building management. This paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the end-user to select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through the spatio-temporal building performance data.},

Firstly, the paper investigates how the use of new technologies in industrial systems improves organisational resilience supporting both a technical and human level. Secondly, the paper reports empirical results that correlate academic literature with Industry 4.0 interdependencies between edge components to both external and internal services and systems. The novelty of the paper is a new approach for creating a virtual representation operating as a real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process (i.e., digital twin) outlined in a conceptual diagram. The methodology applied in this paper resembled a grounded theory analysis of complex interconnected and coupled systems. By connecting the human–computer interactions in different information knowledge management systems, this paper presents a summary of mechanisms for the evolution of artificial intelligence in internet of things networks.},

One noteworthy factor and fact is that there are fresh data sources emerging and pouring out a lot of usable and reusable data. With the number of different, distributed, and decentralized data sources is consistently on the rise, the resulting data scope, size, structure, schema, and speed are greatly changing and challenging too. The other dominant and prominent aspects include polyglot microservices are solidifying deeply as the new building and deployment/execution block in the software world toward the much-needed accelerated software design, development, deployment, and delivery. The device ecosystem expands frenetically with the arrival of trendy and handy, slim and sleek, disappearing and disposable gadgets, gizmos thereby ubiquitous (anywhere, anytime, and any device) access, and usage of web-scale information, content, and services get fructified. Finally, all sorts of casually found and cheap articles in our everyday environments (homes, hotels, hospitals, etc.) are being systematically digitized and service enabled in order to exhibit a kind of real-world smartness and sagacity in their individual as well as collective actions and reactions. Thus trillions of digitized objects, billions of connected devices, and millions of polyglot software services are bound to interact insightfully with one another over locally as well as with remote ones over any networks purposefully. And hence the amount of transactional, operational, analytical, commercial, social, personal, and professional data created through a growing array of interactions and collaborations is growing very rapidly. Now if the data getting collected, processed, and stocked are not subjected to deeper, deft, and decisive investigations, then the tactically as well as strategically sound knowledge (the beneficial patterns, tips, techniques, associations, alerts, risk factors, fresh opportunities, possibilities, etc.) hidden inside the data heaps goes unused literally. For collecting, stocking, and processing such a large amount of multistructured data, the traditional databases, analytics platforms, the ETL tools, etc., are found insufficient. Hence the Apache Hadoop ecosystem technologies and tools are being touted as the best way forward to squeeze out the right and relevant knowledge. In this chapter, you can find the details about the emerging technologies and platforms for spearheading the big data movement.},

  abstract       = {Internet of Things (IoT) contributes to improve the quality of life as it supports many applications, especially healthcare systems. Data generated from IoT devices is sent to the Cloud Computing (CC) for processing and storage, despite the latency caused by the distance. Because of the revolution in IoT devices, data sent to CC has been increasing. As a result, another problem added to the latency was increasing congestion on the cloud network. Fog Computing (FC) was used to solve these problems because of its proximity to IoT devices, while filtering data is sent to the CC. FC is a middle layer located between IoT devices and the CC layer. Due to the massive data generated by IoT devices on FC, Dynamic Weighted Round Robin (DWRR) algorithm was used, which represents a load balancing (LB) algorithm that is applied to schedule and distributes data among fog servers by reading CPU and memory values of these servers in order to improve system performance. The results proved that DWRR algorithm provides high throughput which reaches 3290 req/sec at 919 users. A lot of research is concerned with distribution of workload by using LB techniques without paying much attention to Fault Tolerance (FT), which implies that the system continues to operate even when fault occurs. Therefore, we proposed a replication FT technique called primary-backup replication based on dynamic checkpoint interval on FC. Checkpoint was used to replicate new data from a primary server to a backup server dynamically by monitoring CPU values of primary fog server, so that checkpoint occurs only when the CPU value is larger than 0.2 to reduce overhead. The results showed that the execution time of data filtering process on the FC with a dynamic checkpoint is less than the time spent in the case of the static checkpoint that is independent on the CPU status.},

  abstract       = {In today’s competitive scenario, the manufacturing industries are lagging behind in implementing the Industry 4.0 concept or in integrating smart, ubiquitous components due to high cost and high energy consumption due to the volatile market. The digital transformation has reshaped the manufacturing industries and has paved the way towards data-driven, intelligent, networked, and resilient manufacturing systems. In this context, Industry 4.0 is progressing exponentially and offers a productive output in terms of circular economy and cleaner production to attain ethical business by achieving accuracy, precision, and efficiency. Hence, there is a strong requirement to revamp the traditional manufacturing set-ups into smart manufacturing to gain self-adaptability, reliability, and flexibility with high quality and low-cost output. The paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for Industry 4.0 set-up to achieve circular economy and cleaner production by optimizing products-machine allocation. The proposed MILP model optimizes the trade-off between energy consumption and machine processing cost to gain a circular economy and cleaner production respectively. The proposed model also achieves ethical business by deploying sensors to capture real-time information to establish the Industry 4.0 facility. The paper discusses the product-machine specific analysis to optimize the manufacturing of customized and high-end products at low production cost with minimal energy consumption. The objective of the paper is to minimize the total cost and energy consumption of machines for establishing the Industry 4.0 facility to gain a circular economy and cleaner production. The proposed model is demonstrated and computationally tested on small, moderate, and large data instances and presented with their detailed analysis.},

These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.},

In addition, advances in Automation, Computing Science and Artificial Intelligence provide tools and methods to assist the managers. In particular, the use of tele-remote systems, as SCADA, allows the collection of data and the control of hydraulic devices. Today, by benefiting from the power of computers and servers, the digital twins of hydrographical networks can be designed. A digital twin aims to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a canal. It is used to play-back past scenarios allowing feedback of applied management strategies and fast simulations with predictive and adaptive management strategies to determine their performances and giving decision aid criteria for the managers.

  year  = {2016},
  abstract       = {The ability of additive manufacturing (AM) processes to produce components with virtually any geometry presents a unique challenge in terms of quantifying the dimensional quality of the part. In this paper, a novel spectral graph theory (SGT) approach is proposed for resolving the following critical quality assurance concern in AM: how to quantify the relative deviation in dimensional integrity of complex AM components. Here, the SGT approach is demonstrated for classifying the dimensional integrity of standardized test components. The SGT-based topological invariant Fiedler number (λ2) was calculated from 3D point cloud coordinate measurements and used to quantify the dimensional integrity of test components. The Fiedler number was found to differ significantly for parts originating from different AM processes (statistical significance p-val. &lt; 1%). By comparison, prevalent dimensional integrity assessment techniques, such as traditional statistical quantifiers (such as mean and standard deviation) and examination of specific facets/landmarks failed to capture part-to-part variations, and thus proved incapable of ranking the quality of test AM components in a consistent manner. In contrast, the SGT approach was able to consistently rank the quality of the AM components with a high degree of statistical confidence independent of sampling technique used. Consequently, from a practical standpoint, the SGT approach can be a powerful tool for assessing the dimensional integrity of AM components, and thus encourage wider adoption of AM capabilities.},

  abstract       = {This study draws on an extensive survey and interview data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents were executives of industrials firms whose factories, warehouses, and headquarters are located in Northern Italy. This is undoubtedly the European region first and most extensively affected by the pandemic, and the government implemented radical lockdown measures, banning nonessential travel and mandating the shutdown of all nonessential businesses. Several major effects on both product and service businesses are highlighted, including the disruption of field-service operations and supply networks. This study also highlights the increased importance of servitization business models and the acceleration of digital transformation and advanced services. To help firms navigate through the crisis and be better positioned after the pandemic, the authors present a four-stage crisis management model (calamity, quick & dirty, restart, and adapt), which provides insights and critical actions that should be taken to cope with the expected short and long-term implications of the crisis. Finally, this study discusses how servitization can enhance resilience for future crises—providing a set of indicators on the presumed role of, and impact on, service operations in relation to what executives expect to be the “next normal.},

  abstract       = {Cyber-physical microgrids hold the key to a carbon-neutral power sector since they enable renewable and distributed energy resource integration, can alleviate overloaded distribution systems, and provide economic energy by generating and consuming power locally. The utilization of cyber-physical assets such as controllers, IoT sensors and actuators, and communication devices can enhance the stability and improve the control of microgrids. However, such assets, if maliciously operated, can become attack entry points and jeopardize the grid operation. Blind and uncoordinated cyber-attacks can be identified by existing security measures overcoming potential operational disruptions. However, rootkit attacks can stay hidden within cyber-physical systems and leverage system information to mask their presence. Rootkit detection is a strenuous process and requires advanced security methods due to their sophisticated operation. A careful analysis of possible rootkit target locations and their exploitation techniques is necessary to design effective threat detection and mitigation mechanisms. This paper discusses the cyber kill chain of a rootkit which can simultaneously deploy itself at multiple locations in a microgrid in a coordinated and stealthy way in order to maximize the impact on power system operations. The rootkit leverages system measurements to hide its presence and its attack impact from the detection mechanisms.},

In recent years, a large number of technological innovations have been developed and introduced into practice, enabling the implementation of smart and connected manufacturing systems. Over the next years, researchers and practitioners will face new challenges in Industry 4.0 to achieve the original vision of an intelligent and self-optimizing factory. We are currently at a crossroads between the first level of Industry 4.0, which was characterized by technologically driven innovations, and a future level of Industry 4.0+, which will be based on data-driven innovation. This article introduces these two phases of Industry 4.0 and gives a direction of research trends with growing attention in manufacturing science and practice. In the context of Industry 4.0+, two research directions, in particular, are expected to generate groundbreaking changes in production and its environment. This is, on the one hand, the introduction of Artificial Intelligence into manufacturing and on the other hand the use of nature as inspiration in the form of Biological Transformation.},

More agility, robustness, flexibility, and scalability are required to conform to optimum standard of abstraction. As 5G is at the verge of technology domain, this is high time when we should keep our focus on the next-generation advanced 6G technology to cater the issues of existing SAGIN ecosystem. In this article, we envisage a clear vision on how 6G can improve the current scenario of the SAGIN infrastructure will some value-added services. We firstly, present basics behind the SAGIN and discuss key concepts of the 6G. Secondly, we review key technologies related to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite-based communications. Thirdly, we describe key enablers of the 6G-enbled SAGIN i.e., 6G-SAGIN. Fourthly, we present the UAV-as-a-service to augment the comprehension of 6G-SAGIN. Fifthly, we extend the orientation of 6G-SAGIN toward elemental design aspects. Finally, we depict key open research challenges and prescribe some future direction.},

In complex manufacturing systems with many digital twins, information must be aggregated, which leads to the requirement for digital twins to interact. Reference architectures for digital twins are required when digital twins from different vendors have to interact. This paper extends the Six-Layer Architecture for Digital Twins (SLADT) to a reference architecture with aggregation (SLADTA). The architecture makes maximum use of vendor-neutral off-the-shelf software, as well as secure and open protocols for twin-to-twin communication. SLADTA is illustrated through an application in a manufacturing cell scenario.},

A key enabler for the advances promised by CPPSs is the concept of a digital twin, which is the virtual representation of a real-world entity, or the physical twin. An important step towards the success of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of practical reference architectures. This paper presents an architecture for such a digital twin, which enables the exchange of data and information between a remote emulation or simulation and the physical twin. The architecture comprises different layers, including a local data layer, an IoT Gateway layer, cloud-based databases and a layer containing emulations and simulations. The architecture can be implemented in new and legacy production facilities, with a minimal disruption of current installations. This architecture provides a service-based and real-time enabled infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration. To evaluate the architecture, it was implemented for a small, but typical, physical manufacturing system component.},

In such systems, it is mandatory to monitor the field network and detect potential threats before a problem occurs. This work proposes a hybrid approach that orchestrates unsupervised and incremental learning methods to detect threats that impact the control loops in a plant. We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90% precision and with accuracy higher than 95%.},

IIoT connects sensors, industrial equipment, products, and staff in the factory, enabling context-awareness and industrial equipment automate control. The identity resolution system is a core infrastructure in IIoT. Similar to the role of Domain Name System (DNS) on the Internet, it is the entrance to the IIoT. The difference between them is their input and output. The input of the identity resolution system in IIoT is an identifier of an object. And the output is the mapping data attached to the identifier, including the product profile, a URL, or the identifier's surrounding environment. However, how to deploy an identity resolution system in IIoT has not yet been conclusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the potential identity resolution systems that may be used in IIoT. Firstly, an overview of the identity resolution system is introduced, including a reference framework that can be used to evaluate an identity resolution system. Then we review some influential identity resolution systems based on this reference framework. After that, we make a comparison from the perspective of whether they can meet IIoT requirements and technology selection. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.},

In this work, a data-driven process optimization framework has been proposed for the additive manufacturing process, integrating machine learning, finite-element method (FEM) modeling, and cloud-edge data storage/transfer optimization. A three-level hierarchy of local machines, factory clouds, and a research center is introduced with each level responsible for its dedicated tasks. In addition, to ensure the efficiency of data transfer and storage, an edge-cloud data transfer scheme is constructed, which serves as a guideline for the data flow in the AM framework. Moreover, an overview of the connections between the proposed framework and the Industry 4.0 framework is presented.},

The BDVA Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) defines overall goals, technical and non-technical priorities, and research and innovation challenges for this European Public Private Partnership (PPP) on big data. With the aim to find an agreed synthesis, the BDVA adopted the smart manufacturing industry (SMI) concept definition, including the whole value chain gravitating around goods production. Both the Industrial Internet Consortium and Platform Industries 4.0 have developed IT reference architectures in the manufacturing domain: Platform Industries 4.0's Reference Architecture Model for Industries 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) and the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA). The chapter shows the list of research challenges within the three SMI scenarios: smart factory scenario, smart supply chain scenario, and smart product lifecycle.},

Combined with cybersecurity, they become fundamental elements for creating intelligence in an industrial system that can increase the flexibility of production in addition to allocating resources more efficiently. In order to successfully transition to ecosystem 4.0, the industry must examine the new skills that are required and the need for qualified personnel. The fourth industrial revolution corresponds to the widespread use of sensors and intelligent agents to connect machines, components, processes and operators. This is generally called the digital factory or industry 4.0. It suggests a global system of effective communication between the modules of decision-making. World 4.0 will allow interaction between products, machines and even between machines (M2M). The product will also be able to communicate with machines in the production phase. This is called intelligent production, which will allow the modification and customization of products in their production phase. In this article, we present a communication model based on Modbus and multiband communication using NB-IOT, this communication model allows data to be exchanged between different industrial equipment (PLCs, SCADA systems, etc.) via MODBUS RTU and ASCII, via RS485, or via analog and digital inputs for sensors and actuators.},

However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied. Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five ecosystems. Cluster 02–05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at least two ecosystems. Clusters 06–15 are ecosystem-specific that only include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.},

  abstract       = {Technologies related to Industry 4.0 require Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to understand their potential applications before they are adopted. In this paper, we test empirically a framework that links SME search strategies within their ecosystem (i.e., breadth of search vs. depth of search) to the capability of SMEs to recognise digital opportunities associated with Industry 4.0 (i.e., digital design, digital manufacturing and digital servitisation opportunities). We analyse a sample of 174 manufacturing SMEs operating in Italy. Our results illustrate the distinguishing traits of the knowledge search paths required to implement Industry 4.0 technologies in an SME manufacturing setting. In particular, they indicate that the recognition of digital opportunities in both product design and manufacturing processes require a depth of collaboration in the innovation process to capture firm and industry-specific company needs and to create mutual trust among the parties. Conversely, digital opportunities in the realm of product/service platforms require a breadth of search for SMEs to invest in different information technology layers to support the digitalisation of a product. We also find that all three groups of digital opportunities positively influence the extent of adoption of information and digital technologies (e.g., IoT, big data analytics, simulation). Our findings bring finer-grained evidence on how digital opportunities are linked with the adoption of the different types of Industry 4.0 technologies, reflecting the peculiar traits of manufacturing SMEs. Moreover, they show managers how to set specific collaboration strategies with the ecosystem according to the digital opportunities they are willing to pursue.},

  abstract    = {In the era of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, machines and devices are increasingly getting connected. These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices’ known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.},

  abstract    = {Continuous and effective monitoring of chronic diseases and their associated treatments might have a decisive impact on reducing risks and improving life quality of patients. This, however, demands new and innovative methods for engineering systems that support the required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to revolutionize traditional medical practices. A DT comprises a set of virtual representations of both the structural elements and dynamics of any physical asset (e.g., a patient) throughout its lifecycle. In the healthcare domain, it might represent a significan step forward towards tightening and improving the interactions between systems, caregivers and patients. Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.},

Maintenance is one of the functions that may benefit from the opportunities that emerge with the digital transformation of industrial processes. Nevertheless, until now very few research papers investigated on what digitalized manufacturing entails for maintenance organizations along both technical and social dimensions. The aim of this paper is to investigate the vision of the future of Maintenance within the industry 4.0 and to show empirical evidence on how manufacturing companies are approaching the digital transformation process of maintenance. An empirical investigation was developed through multiple case-study involving nine manufacturing companies in Italy. Findings emerge about the main perceived challenges by companies for the success of digital transformation of maintenance as well as the technological and organizational mechanisms that are used in ongoing innovative Maintenance projects.},

Design : We introduce the Industry 4.0 paradigm, presents its background, current state of development and its influence on the development of the simulation modelling paradigm. Further, we present the multiple case study methodology and examine several research and development projects involving automated industrial process modelling, presented in recent scientific publications and conclude with lessons learned. Results: We present the research problems and main results from five individual cases of adoption of the new simulation modelling paradigm. Main lesson learned is that while the new simulation modelling paradigm is being adopted by big companies and SMEs, there are significant differences depending on company size in problems that they face, and the methodologies and technologies they use to overcome the issues. Conclusion: While the examined cases indicate the acceptance of the new simulation modelling paradigm in the industrial and scientific communities, its adoption in academic environment requires close cooperation with industry partners and diversification of knowledge of researchers in order to build integrated, multi-level models of cyber-physical systems. As shown by the presented cases, lack of tools is not a problem, as the current generation of general purpose simulation modelling tools offers adequate integration options.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Abstract This paper proposes a general approach for using conversational interfaces such as chatbots to offer adaptive learning of business processes in an environment involving different actors. Adaptivity concerns both the content being proposed, the sequence of learning items, and the way the conversation is conducted. The original approach allows the development of sustainable chatbots and empowers various non-technical actors (authors, teachers, publishers, and learners) to control the chatbot features directly. The aCHAT-WF framework (adaptive CHATbot for WorkFlows), proposed in this paper for managing conversational interfaces, conceptually represents all the aspects related to a conversation about business processes, with different facets for the user, the conversation flow, and the conversation contents, combining them to obtain a flexible interaction with the user. The paper focuses on the different preparation phases for instructional material based on Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models, separating the different roles involved in the construction of a chatbot for teaching business processes and with the possibility of defining different styles for the interaction with the users. The proposed method is configuration-driven, to facilitate the separation of the different aspects of the control of the interaction and the delivery of contents.},

  abstract       = {In Industry 4.0, machine data acquisition plays an important role in improving overall performance on the factory floor by monitoring processes, providing feedback, and integrating the information with other machines. Leveraging these hidden data instantaneously to reduce machine downtime could also minimize efforts in determining the causes of maintenance issues. This paper explores a novel method of bringing the factory floor data into an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment and visualizing real-time machine analytics through Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) based smart devices. The factory floor data from selective machines at a Volvo Group plant was integrated with IIoT and visualized in real-time through the use of AR-enabled devices such as an iPad and a HoloLens headset. The configuration process for the server and IIoT environment was automated through a software solution, and the performance and feasibility of spatial anchors were evaluated by testing accuracy, triggering times, and latency of data. The results displayed promising applications of AR/MR on factory floors for real-time machine data visualization and associated troubleshooting.},

  abstract       = {Although the concepts of cloud computing are well known and used in almost every domain and by companies of all sizes, new ideas and technologies in this area are emerging almost daily. As a result, cloud users often struggle to obtain an up-to-date overview of the most important dimensions of cloud computing and the services that are offered by various cloud providers. Therefore, this paper develops a cloud computing taxonomy that is theoretically grounded by performing a structured literature review and empirically validated by conducting workshops with participants from industry and science. By describing the most important dimensions and characteristics of cloud computing in detail and by applying the taxonomy using three large cloud providers, we aim to give the reader a holistic overview of the cloud and demonstrate the relevance of cloud computing for digital innovation.},

Unlike other cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are implemented using single-board computers. The practical results show that the proposed DT is able to mitigate the coordinated false data injection and the denial of service cyber-attacks.},

The digital twin (DT) is a new concept that can unleash tremendous opportunities and can be used at the different control and security levels of power systems. This paper provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from the different actual power and control entities. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the voltage estimates, with 98.2% accuracy from only the controllers' states.},

The model estimates the grid impedance seen by a distributed energy resource. The proposed algorithm has characteristics of passive and active islanding detection methods. Using a discrete state-space representation of a dq0 axis power system as equality constraints, a digital twin is optimized to match the power system of interest. The concept is to use the estimated grid impedance as the parameter to identify the difference between normal operation and islanding scenarios. Selecting arbitrary initial values, the digital twin approximates the response of the actual system and therefore a value for the system impedance. Results indicate that the proposed method has the potential to estimate the grid impedance at the point of common coupling.},

The house concerned by the construction is powered by a renewable, clean, and free energy source which is photovoltaic energy. Then, the house management system is based on an Arduino and embedded microprocessor-based systems. This work is a hybridization between several disciplines such as computer science, electronics, electricity, and mechanics. Next, a smart and sustainable home is characterized by many benefits like resident comfort, security, and energy-saving. The first part of this project focuses on building a model with the modules used (sensors, actuators, Wi-Fi interface, etc.). The second part is reserved for the implementation of the system and to make it controllable via a smartphone or a computer.},

The idea is that the real product and its virtual counterpart are twins that travel a parallel journey from design and development to production and service life. The intelligence that comes from DTs’ operational data supports the interactions between the DTs to pave the way for the cyber-physical integration of smart manufacturing. This paper presents a conceptual framework for digital twins collaboration to provide an auto-detection of erratic operational data by utilizing operational data intelligence in the manufacturing systems. The proposed framework provide an interaction mechanism to understand the DT status, interact with other DTs, learn from each other DTs, and share common semantic knowledge. In addition, it can detect the anomalies and understand the overall picture and conditions of the operational environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework is described in the workflow model, which breaks down into four phases: information extraction, change detection, synchronization, and notification. A use case of Energy 4.0 fault diagnosis for wind turbines is described to present the use of the proposed framework and DTs collaboration to identify and diagnose the potential failure, e.g., malfunctioning nodes within the energy industry.},

In this context, this paper aims to analyse the literature and recruitment repositories to identify the new job profiles in the factory of the future (FoF) across six industrial technological sectors, namely Collaborative Robotics (Cobots), Additive Manufacturing (AM), Mechatronics and Machine Automation (MMA), Data Analytics (DA), Cybersecurity (CS) and Human-Machine Interface (HMI). The performed analysis allowed to compile a catalogue of 100 new job profiles that were characterised and analysed in terms of technical and soft skills, type and level of profile, as well as the frequency demand.},

However, the TDs lack a way to describe the physical effect of said interactions on the device itself, as well as on the environment around the device, limiting its viability for cyber-physical scenarios. In this paper, we propose an extension for describing the effects of an interaction on the property affordances of a Thing in the TD as a first step towards a TD that is able to fully describe a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). We show this extension permits the generation of accurate Digital Twins, facilitates machine-aided system design and device mashup generation and allows for formal verification of the functionality of CPSs during their deployment and maintenance.},

It addresses the risks associated with the integration of computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus specifically on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the potential risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this model for further research as well as practical applications for the electrical power sector.},

Technological progress has also been crucial to allow the exploitation of new deposits in more complex scenarios: lower ore grades, extreme weather conditions, deeper deposits, harder rock mass, and high-stress environments. This paper discusses the importance of innovation for the mining industry and describes the mechanisms by which it is carried out. It includes a review of the drivers and actors involved and current trends. The digital transformation process that the industry is going through is analyzed, along with other relevant trends that are likely to shape the mining of the future. Additionally, a case study is presented to illustrate the technical and economic implications of developing a disruptive innovation project.},

  abstract       = {The dawn of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has brought about a series of novel services never imagined until recently. However, certain deployments such as those employing Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN)-based technologies may present severe network restrictions in terms of throughput and supported packet length. This situation prompts the isolation of LPWAN systems on islands with limited interoperability with the Internet. For that reason, the IETF’s LPWAN working group has proposed a Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) scheme that permits compression and fragmentation of and IPv6/UDP/CoAP packets with the aim of making them suitable for transmission over the restricted links of LPWANs. Given the impact that such a solution can have in many IoT scenarios, this paper addresses its real evaluation in terms not only of latency and delivery ratio improvements, as a consequence of different compression and fragmentation levels, but also of the overhead in end node resources and useful payload sent per fragment. This has been carried out with the implementation of middleware and using a real testbed implementation of a LoRaWAN-to-IPv6 architecture together with a publish/subscribe broker for CoAP. The attained results show the advantages of SCHC, and sustain discussion regarding the impact of different SCHC and LoRaWAN configurations on the performance. It is highlighted that necessary end node resources are low as compared to the benefit of delivering long IPv6 packets over the LPWAN links. In turn, fragmentation can impose a lack of efficiency in terms of data and energy and, hence, a cross-layer solution is needed in order to obtain the best throughput of the network.},

Safety-critical systems, such as planes, are at risk because cyber-information cannot be provably tied to a specific physical part instance (e.g., impeller). This paper presents promising initial work showing that using piezoelectric sensors to measure impedance identities of parts may serve as a physically unclonable function that can produce unclonable part instance identities. When one of these impedance identities is combined with cyber-information and signed using existing public key infrastructure approaches, it creates a provable binding of cyber-information to a specific part instance. Our initial results from experimentation with traditionally and additively manufactured parts indicate that it will be extremely expensive and improbable for an attacker to counterfeit a part that replicates the impedance signature of a legitimate part.},

Humanitarian assistance requiring short response time windows in almost the whole world may be subject to long queues due to managing problems, e.g., the lack of control and/or inefficient infrastructure. This work tackles such challenge by proposing a low-cost planning and managing model and method based on a discrete-event simulation mirror connected through WEB tools to a near or far management level. The usual configuration of parallel servers (for instance, supported by local RFID monitoring) is implemented by a discrete-event simulation model that is validated by Jackson Networks (and vice versa). The results show a flexible model that may identify bottlenecks in advance in order to accommodate traffic flow variations.},

In order to follow the IoT vision and gain the inherent benefits, industrial information systems providers have been modernizing their solutions. However, the complexity of such systems has been proving an obstacle in developing efficient solutions. Following the trends of the industrial IoT including Smart Manufacturing, Connected Factories, and Factories of the Future, industrial and academic projects have also been aiming at developing better solutions for IIoT-related projects. Such solutions typically heavily rely on interoperability requirements between sensors, actuators and other IoT-based diverse smart devices toward, for example, supply chain and production management services such as ERP, MES, and SCADA. This chapter identifies challenges in developing IIoT solutions, based on recent R&D projects. Such identification, in turn, contributes to proposing opportunities, challenges, methodologies, and approaches for the analysis, design, implementation, and deployment of R&D projects. This is specifically so when developing interoperable solutions for the IIoT domain, mainly concerning the applications of the IoT and services to the manufacturing industry.},

While Industry 4.0 and similar technologies have many potential manufacturing advantages, the great majority of these innovations are established for and/or by large companies. But there is a failure to understand about how these technologies are implemented in businesses today. As a result, we want to learn more about the patterns of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing and production companies. In this paper, we explore if production organisations can be organised based on Industry 4.0 adoption trends and how these patterns allow the definition of certain industrial 4.0 technology configurations. Such study helps us to understand what is necessary for the proper adoption in manufacturing and production enterprises of such technologies. We present a study of the analysis of manufacturing and manufacturing businesses in the machines and appliances industry.},

  abstract    = {Connectivity is the one word summary for Industry 4.0 revolution. The importance of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) have been increased dramatically with the rise of industrialization and industry 4.0. As new opportunities bring their own challenges, with the massive interconnected devices of the IIoT, cyber security of those networks and privacy of their users have become an important aspect. Specifically, intrusion detection for industrial networks (IIoT) has great importance. For instance, it is a key factor in improving the safe operation of the smart grid systems yet protecting the privacy of the consumers at the same time. In the same manner, data streaming is a valid option when the analysis is to be pushed from the cloud to the fog for industrial networks to provide agile response, since it brings the advantage of fast action on intrusion detection and also can buy time for intrusion mitigation.

In order to dive deep in industrial networks, basic ground needs to be settled. Hence, this chapter serves in this manner, by presenting basic and emerging technologies along with ideas and discussions: First, an introduction of semiconductor evolution is provided along with the up-to-date hi-tech wired/wireless communication solutions for industrial networks. This is followed by a thorough representation of future trends in industrial environments. More importantly, enabling technologies for industrial networks is also presented. Finally, the chapter is concluded with a summary of the presentations along with future projections of IIoT networks.},

  abstract       = {Digital Revolution has forced previously isolated networks of critical infrastructures to become more digitally integrated. Recent cyber-attacks, including Stuxnet and Wiper, have exposed a new set of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in this field. This new environment has forced previously isolated networks of critical infrastructures like utilities or power plants to become more digitally integrated. This paper offers a view into the most efficient current defense solutions. It also offers a glimpse into the need for the further development of new protection mechanisms developed on the emerging new technologies. The risks posed by the integration of Information Technology solutions with Operational Technology systems have been a key topic also at the latest World Economic Forum conference, where cyber-attacks of critical infrastructures were discussed in the context of the most significant risks for the upcoming decade. The findings of this paper are applicable to other industries. The paper aims to highlight that by initially understanding the vulnerabilities of the IT components and by taking the right cybersecurity preventive measures, critical infrastructure can be protected against these kinds of threats. The research framework behind this paper was directed towards analysing the cyber risks associated with the convergence between the Information Technology solutions with the Operational Technology systems of critical infrastructure.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Optimization of operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) in the industry is a topic that has been largely studied in the literature. Many authors focused on reliability-based approaches to optimize O&amp;M, but little attention has been given to study the influence of macroeconomic variables on the long-term maintenance policy. This work aims to optimize time-based maintenance (TBM) policy in the mining industry. The mine environment is reproduced employing a virtual model that resembles a digital twin (DT) of the system. The effect of maintenance decisions is replicated by a discrete event simulation (DES), whereas a model of the financial operability of the mine is realized through System Dynamics (SD). The simultaneous use of DES and the SD allows us to reproduce the environment with high-fidelity and to minimize the cost of O&amp;M. The selected illustrative case example demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible. The issues of using high dimensional simulation data from DT-models in managerial decision making is identified and discussed.},

Foundries 4.0 refer to the inclusion of Industry 4.0 principles in traditional foundries. The casting process is known to be one of the most energy-intensive processes. Enabling sensor-based technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) for condition monitoring, can be an efficient means to bring down the energy costs. IoTs can also be implemented for real-time waste-monitoring. Embedded sensors can be utilized in determining excessive loads during the casting operation. This is very useful to identify overloading and in avoiding potential damage to the castings. Introduction of Additive Manufacturing can reduce cycle time and material consumption. This paper aims to introduce the concept of Foundries 4.0. The key focus is to highlight the integration of digital technologies in establishing foundries of the future. Challenges involved in the establishment of smart foundries are also discussed. A case-study discussing establishment of energy-efficient smart foundries is also presented in this work.},

We are all living more and more digital lives to augment our physical senses, leverage our resources, and stretch our productivity—we end up almost believing how digital could make us immortal and able to reproduce our thinking and ways of communicating to our dears even after our physical body will be gone. Indeed, digital immortality is pitched as a commercial proposition by many a Silicon Valley’s start-up (Adam Gabbatt 2020) Eternime one among many others (Dave Schilling 2016). Not only us as individuals but also, almost inevitably, our company may have launched some sort of digital transformation “navigation program, as part of a digital transformation that is encompassing its industrial sector of reference and city of location. Even entire countries and their policy makers are now pitching themselves as “digitally driven and “digitally minded, when asking for taxes or votes, as they promise to bring their citizens in the digital age—assuming they are still analogic today and doing complicated math with pen and paper.

They all share a common theme, reminding us of how weak we are and of humankind’s fallibility (and even existential risk) through history. We discussed at length COVID-19, which came up as a totally unexpected event during the writing of this book. In fact, climate change looks like bringing even greater disruption in the world of cities to come—with the pandemic giving us just a preliminary idea of how hard it will be to deal with this. As stated by The Economist, as economy activity has stalled because of lockdown, 2020 will likely see drops in CO2 emissions of between 4 and 7%. But in order to keep the earth warming target of less than 2 °C, CO2 would need to fall to near zero by 2050—without halting the economies and locking down entire populations but rewiring the first and reshaping the second (The great disrupter 2020). The rewiring of the economy will require a radical redesign of the energy sector and of its global geopolitics, with powerful petro-States of the past giving room to even more powerful electro-States of the future. With clean energy gaining momentum with both investors and end users (and voters) and with interest rates near zero, more and more international politicians are now backing accelerated green-infrastructure conversion plans. The shift from fossil fuel (today accounting for 85% of the energy produced globally) will be evident everywhere and ever so much in the world’s mega cities, which will have to rely on renewable and green energy to provide mobility, heat and air conditioning, and the basic support to commercial and manufacturing sectors working in their extended urban and suburban areas. Energy will also be needed to support services to the person, such as healthcare.},

It would be hard to put a precise date on when it all started (creative destruction is, after all, a continuous process and the very engine of growth for the capitalistic model). It would be even more difficult to put clear references and well-defined assumptions on the main change agents and drivers of these—digital innovation (a “misnomer per se) being likely one of the most often cited factors of transformation (transformation being also a “misnomer). However, it is safe to postulate that the pace of change has been consistently accelerating, with deeper and wider disruptions happening more often and in unexpected ways. The very notion of “tail risk is now under scrutiny—with so many “black swans flying around, it is difficult to see the linearity element in all this, not to mention the normality of a distribution that is based on large numbers and predictable casualty. In this context of extreme and accelerated, multi-faceted disruptions, “smart cities have been ailed and positioned as a good force for change. Hosting more than half of the global population and set to rise further, they have been promising “smarter ways of doing things—basically, leveraging digital technology to offer better use cases on such utilities such as energy consumption, mobility, and safety. The initial hype linked to large development and urban regeneration programs designed around these use cases has so far fallen short of expectations—with real estate values and the very attractiveness of the city in question failing to capture the value arising from the “smart city component of these. In answer to this, a number of new technological advances are already being set in place—from 5G (mobile connectivity, with real-time and enhanced, localized hedge computing) to IoT (always charged, smaller, and even implantable) to multi-cloud-based solutions where AI/ML apps are becoming a core part of the software as a service proposition. As a result, the “smart city is becoming “cyber, with greater centrality put on the individual and on the specific services he may need, for business or leisure. Digital interaction is augmented by more personalized and real-time feedbacks, with services dynamically adjusting themselves (hence cybernetic).},

Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.},

Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms. We propose an IoT Cybersecurity Communication Scorecard to help organizations benchmark the density and sentiment of their corporate communications regarding security against their specific industry.},

For this paper we assume, that IT systems are also objects to change – they have to be adapted to changes to products and facilities on the shop floor. Today the adaption of IT systems is managed and done manually – therefore the authors propose an automated way of changing the production's IT-systems. For this purpose two main ideas are described: reading and interpreting a self-description of production equipment and enrichment of these descriptions with data from the “digital factory bridging the gap between planning and operating IT-systems and thus enabling higher adaptivity of manufacturing systems.},

The core concept for I4.0 is the digital twin or asset administration shell (AAS), as it is called by the German Plattform Industrie 4.0 initiative. It shall provide a machine-readable description of I4.0 components, being available over the entire lifecycle and being used for various advanced use cases and services. Security has been an increasingly known and needed aspect during the last years and is a key requirement to make I4.0 actually happen. In a previous paper we proposed concepts for integrating authorization tightly into OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)-based information models. OPC UA is a new and promising industrial technology, which could be used to implement AAS concepts. The current proposals for AAS define necessary security concepts; however, there is no work explaining how these concepts can be implemented in OPC UA. This paper closes this gap by elaborating on realization alternatives in OPC UA. Furthermore, we extend our basic performance evaluation with more realistic data access patterns based on I4.0 use cases, showing the applicability of our approach in practice.},

In order to maintain line stability, qualified maintenance personnel are essential for fast and secure troubleshooting the highly automated transportation system of a semiconductor plant. However, the transfer of knowledge to new maintenance personnel for coping with malfunctions is a big challenge. This is also a contribution in the digital transformation in this context for training of people at highly digitized workplaces by introducing a virtual training for (new) employees. This training supports new maintenance personnel to gain practical experience in operating a modern human-machine interface without disturbing the existing productive system. Initial results indicate that this approach supports the transformation process in a targeted manner. For future work, we aim to examine other performance metrics and their impact over time.},

The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.},

In such a network based CS, graphs of possible machine command sequences are specified in advance by physics frameworks. The actual traffic pattern, however, is determined at runtime, depending on interlocks and beam requests from experiments and accelerators. In 'unlucky' combinations, large packet bursts can delay commands beyond their deadline, potentially causing emergency shutdowns. Thus, prior verification if any possible combination of given command sequences can be delivered on time is vital to guarantee deterministic behavior of the CS. Deterministic network calculus (DNC) can derive upper bounds on message delivery latencies. This paper presents an approach for calculating worst-case descriptors of runtime traffic patterns. These so-called arrival curves are deduced from specified partial traffic sequences and are used to calculate end-to-end traffic properties. With the arrival curves and a DNC model of the FAIR CS network, a worst-case latency for specific packet flows or the whole CS can be obtained.},

  abstract       = {There are numerous emerging technologies that are potentially disruptive to business, to government, and to society. This paper looks at the two levels of disruptive technologies. A first order disruption is a localized change, within a market or industry. A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.},

  abstract       = {Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment (DSMA) has progressed from challenging traditional soil science paradigms, through small scale prototyping, to large-scale implementation capturing quantitative measures of soil attributes and functions. This paper considers the future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory, tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to provide the background to a soil and landscape `digital twin' and the consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools. Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of public-private partnerships in this development and application. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  volume         = {159},
  abstract       = {Physical assets in manufacturing, can be: machines, sensors, actuators and in general everything that can be part of the plant and its processes. In such domain, the search for “agility has come to be one of the most requested features. As a result, considerable research has been conducted to design manufacturing systems which embody manufacturing flexibility. It is in this context where the evolution of the supply-chain based concept of Mini Factories is relevant, as it allows a network-like interconnectivity between assets by setting up factories inside the premises of the principal manufacturer. It is stated that at the core of Industry 4.0 implementation, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the bridge between the physical world and the IoT world or, in other words, the data model from where the digital twin stems from. In this paper we present a methodology to create Asset Administrative Shells in a Mini Factories context. We argue that our approach, effectively embodies concepts related to Industry 4.0 in a modular way, allowing the much-desired agility. By using our proposed methodology, Model Factory @ARTC has been able to create a seamless integration of assets into our factory of the future, demonstrating the connectivity and some of the enhanced capabilities of Industry 4.0.},

Internet of Things (IoT) is the fusion of devices and sensors by an information network to enable new and autonomous capabilities. The integration of IoT with industrial applications known as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The IIoT is found in several critical infrastructures such as water distribution networks. Nowadays, ICS is vulnerable to using the Internet connection to enable industrial IoT sensors to communicate with each other in Real-Time. Therefore, this paper presents an analytical study of detecting anomalies, malicious activities, and cyber-attacks in a cyber-physical of critical water infrastructure in the IIoT infrastructure. The study uses various machine learning algorithms to classify the anomaly events including several attacks and IIoT hardware failures. A real-world dataset covering 15 anomaly situations of normal system activity was analyzed for the research review of the proposed approach. The test situations involved a wide array of incidents from hardware breakdown to water SCADA device sabotage. To classify the malicious activity, various machine learning methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) are used. The results show that CART and NB have the best results for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.},

A brief look at the history of industrial revolution thus seems fitting.

Germany as an industrial location is playing a central role in the Industrie 4.0 initiative (Initiative Industrie 4.0). Will a research initiative grow into something very practical for Germany? And just what does Industrie 4.0 have to do with the major issue of digitalization, which is now monopolizing all media? Just because the name “Industrie 4.0 unfortunately smacks of it, does not mean that the initiative necessarily only benefits industry. Yet those of us who wish to investigate the topic naturally want to know who will actually profit. This introductory chapter seeks to illuminate these questions.},

  abstract       = {Construction projects and cities account for over 50% of carbon emissions and energy consumption. Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, monitoring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling systems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19. The discussion in this paper mainly focuses on the Smart City, Engineering and Construction (SCEC) sectors.},

In order to create a well synchronized digital-twin simulator in manufacturing, information and activities of a physical machine need to be virtualized. Many existing digital-twins stream read-only data of machine sensors and do not incorporate operations of manufacturing machines through Internet. In this paper, a new method of virtualization is proposed to integrate machining data and operations into the digital-twins using Internet scale machine tool communication method. A fully functional digital-twin is implemented in CPMC testbed using MTComm and several manufacturing application scenarios are developed to evaluate the proposed method and system. Performance analysis shows that it is capable of providing data-driven visual monitoring of a manufacturing process and performing manufacturing operations through digital twins over the Internet. Results of the experiments also shows that the MTComm based digital twins have an excellent efficiency.},

Over the last decade, such small and portable devices became cheap and easy to deploy in any kind of application. With the full range of versatile connectivity, such technological development also brings multiple challenges related to the security of infrastructure and data. Many individuals, companies, and states worldwide experience the previously unseen scale and scope of the attacks using novel approaches. All these smart applications have also increased the overall attack surface leading to multiple attack vectors available through vulnerabilities. Lack of standards, insufficient security awareness, and new technological landscape does not help either. Considering this, one needs to enhance forensics investigation methodologies, employ novel tools, combine threat intelligence, and integrate forensic readiness. Such measures will help to reduce the total cyber risk through a high level of preparedness for anticipated data-driven crimes in smart applications. We believe that this paper will help in bringing novel focus to existing digital forensics methodologies with a focus on smart applications.},

A qualitative comparison of the smart city initiatives in selected target countries and cities were done. The research strategy in this study approximates the grounded theory, utilising inductive reasoning to generate arguments and conclusions about the form, validity and future of the smart city. Various actors responsible to convert a traditional city to a smart city are defined and analysed within the context of this study. The main conclusion of this study was that the current research on smart city does not fully address the complex nature, conflicts and interdependencies of the smart city objectives. Moreover, the study found that the smart city initiatives form complex and multidisciplinary platforms that require holistic evaluation as the current evaluation methods and rankings of the smart cities vary considerably, making the evaluation of the success of the smart cities difficult.},

From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical digital twin model framework for CPS design. In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle. Finally, an industrial robot application is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the model framework.},

Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a "digital twin" of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.},

Herein, a unified AMI system across security zones was designed, which used the digital twin auxiliary information system as a supporting system to simulate a multi-service data model. With the comprehensive analysis of the digital twin auxiliary information system to the running results from the model, the collection system could grasp the needs of the application system in real time, thereby dynamically adjusting collection frequency. Furthermore, field running test on this system was carried out in the Measurement Center of Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau, and it verified that the system had the ability to collect data in seconds. the simulation results were analyzed to adjust collection time interval taking load forecasting and spot trading business as examples, using forecast accuracy and power purchase cost as indicators. Finally, it is determined that when the collection frequency is one minute, it could meet the indicator that the average absolute percentage error of load forecast was less than 1%. And in the meantime, the purchase cost deviation of the electricity sellers was much smaller than the 2% error specified by the standard.},

In respect to its practical world applications, the IoT has the prospect of entirely transforming the pharma industry by facilitating and mechanizing the isolated nursing of patients, the innovation of different types of drugs, their admittance, and much more. The combination of the IoT with the growing digitization of figures in the pharma segment has led to a new direction and opened the floodgates for enormous changes and industrial scale innovations. While striving for ingenious inventions, the software needs to keep pace. As previously observed, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are providing tremendous opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry. Similarly, the IoT offers pharma production with an assortment of innovative prospects, such as an improved mechanism for drug trade and better analytical tools. Now the question is how can the IoT be used to benefit the pharmaceutical industry? The answer is that IoT sensors and detectors can help in enabling the optimal circumstances for supervising different styles of biomaterials and chemicals, detecting tool flaws, and it can be also used to assist in the prevention of fraudulent drug activities. People who are involved in industries like pharmaceuticals work in a risk-prone industry where they must avoid asset failures at any cost, as making mistakes is unacceptable because quality control has a direct impact on the health of the consumer and there should be no opportunities for errors to be made. There are a variety of problems that may arise in plants during the manufacture of drugs, such as wear and tear of equipment with time, corrosion, excessive voltage, and destruction caused by the chemicals used. Keeping a proper track of all these risks is crucial to meet the desired quality of the drug, hence a number of sensors are used for the assimilation of enormous amounts of data from different departments that help in managing, controlling, and supervising everything that takes place, initiating a sequence response for better efficacy and control, which will eventually reduce the production cost, minimize waste, and allow for better control.},

ML is the study in which a machine is trained with past data and examples and uses algorithms to build the logic. Important ML applicationsare speech recognition, computer vision, bio-surveillance, robot or automation control, empirical science experiments, DNA classification, intrusion detection, astronomical data analysis, information security, transportation, etc. According to a recent survey, computer-generated insurance advice is helpful to customers. Using ML, determination of cover for a certain customer can be predicted. Choice of the mode of transportation can also be benefited from ML. ML predicts the mode of transportation for an individual to make their travel better. Travel modes may include private car, public transport (bus or train), or soft mode (walking or cycling). The very first step in applying ML is to define a problem. This step includes three important processes to be considered, namely, problem identification, the motivation behind problem solving, and the solution itself. This chapter presents the evolution of ML along with the purpose it serves. It also focuses on the ideas of concept learning along with the methods and algorithms therein.},

  abstract       = {The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in using it to serve their communities.},

Thus, this paper aims to explore the nature of blockchain technology under varying conditions for consumer benefits. Academic and press articles followed by interviews from industry experts were used to explore the nature of blockchain technology (BCT) for the hospitality and tourism sector (HTS). A hybrid research methodology is proposed to investigate the criticality of factors, their hierarchical model, and cause & effect relationships. 35 Employees from two geographies, namely India (N=17) and Netherlands (N=18) in hospitality and tourism firms, were interviewed. In the next step, the expert opinions were collected using the Analytic hierarchy process - Interpretive Structural Modeling- Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ISM-DEMATEL) technique. A forward-looking approach was adopted by considering the implications of barriers and drivers on the adoption of BCT and thereby benefiting HTS. The results suggest that ‘low cost’ and ‘risk management’ are the key drivers with driving power of 1 and 10 in Indian and the Netherlands, respectively. They are placed at I and VI hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group. ‘Lack of Government Regulation/ Policy’ and ‘Market Uncertainty’ are the critical barriers with driving power 9 and 10 in the Indian and Netherlands context, respectively. They are placed at V and III hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group.},

This knowledge was not previously entered into the SCPS knowledge base or known to its resources [16]. Also there are problems associated with communication in socio-cyber-physical systems. For example, one of the problem is in the interaction between devices at the software level [1]. To eliminate the shortcomings, multimodal interfaces are being actively developed, which are aimed at creating a way of interaction between a computer and a person, similar to the interaction between humans. In this way we use all known modalities that are accepted for human communication. In addition, this development will help to solve the main problem of SCPS which means to increase reliability by duplicating information through several channels. There is also a problem in the development of technical requirements for socio-cyber-physical systems. The difficulty in developing such requirements is that they can change throughout the life cycle of the system due to the constant development of socio-cyber-physical systems.},

Recently, players of the real estate and building sector have turned strategic attention and research investments to the automation of building operations, aware of the business relevance of the occupancy phase of facilities. This investigation analyzed R&D programs and experimental projects in Japan to foresee the role of BIM in the automation of building operations. A survey of disclosed information helped to understand the trends in automation research with the adoption of digital technologies for immediate and future use. Appliances from electronics manufacturers have been incorporated into complex cyber-physical systems to communicate with the built facility through a BIM-IoT framework. The evolution of ICT has influenced building management systems attributes which require new definitions of the set of data to be delivered and maintained by project players. There is recent evidence of efforts to turn BIM as the platform that creates, manages and also stores information for future BIM-FM uses, even though the integration with BAS/BEMS is not fully solved. Finally, this study identified connections between prior construction automation achievements by Japanese contractors and future orientation related to the technological challenge of context-awareness and servitization.},

In particular, the use of heat pumps belongs to such technologies, since this enables us to reduce air emissions. Object models are designed on the basis of their digital twins. Digital twins are intended to reflect the structure and processes of object functioning. In addition, we plan to delegate them the decision-making in managing these objects in real-time. Such a digital twin has to become smarter over time. This virtual entity has to gain knowledge and skills to select optimal scenarios for controlling object and improving its functioning parameters. Therefore, the initial problem in its development is creating a monitoring system for the collection, unification, aggregation, storage, and transmission of subject-oriented data. Such data include information about the object operation and environmental state. The data must be promptly obtained from peripheral equipment (controlling and measuring devices). For the effective operation of a digital twin, we have to partially transfer functions of primary data processing, their intellectual analysis and decision-making to the controlling and measuring devices. To this end, we use agents that implement software on peripheral equipment.},

For successful implementation of digitalization, manufacturing companies must consider their existing technical systems, organizational structures, and processes, as well as social aspects. With the support of a maturity model, a company-specific digitalization level can be evaluated to provide manufacturing companies with an initial insight into their particular status quo; this can serve as a starting point for future optimization and digitalization projects. Furthermore, the results of such an analysis allow objective comparison of different areas within the company and with competitors. In this paper, the “Integrierte Arbeitssystemgestaltung in digitalisierten Produktionsunternehmen (InAsPro) maturity model is presented, which considers the Development , Production , and Assembly product lifecycle phases, as well as Aftersales , and assesses their digitalization level focusing on the four dimensions of Technology , Organization , Social Issues , and Corporate Strategy . The maturity model’s rating scale distinguishes between four maturity levels. The results given by the InAsPro maturity model for an entire company are presented, along with those for each product lifecycle phase. Extensive descriptions for each specific maturity level are also provided.},

A proposed solution for improving performance in the manufacturing sector, and consequently developing several economies, such as Brazil, is the adoption of the digital strategy known as Industry 4.0. Since 2011, when this strategy was presented during Hannover Messe, in Germany, it is being considered as fourth industrial revolution, as a result of the developing new digital technologies and principles of implementation. However, to deployment of Industry 4.0, the manufacturing will face a number of challenges, such as related to technical, strategical and organizational contexts. The most frequent challenges are sorted by technical issues and demand for systems in CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) technology. To benefit the manufacturing sector, the challenge of adoption CPS technologies, on real cases should be analyzed. The aim of this article is to present an international literature review about the challenges of Industry 4.0 on manufacturing sector. The literature does not present yet a broad study for identifying the challenges in this sector. As result, was discovered that there is a gap in the literature in the identification of systems solutions, simulated and or applied in the real context, which meet the requirements of CPSs, due to the low level of maturity of this technology. Developing algorithms of CPS and the related technologies of Industry 4.0, beside meet the new production demand is the fundamental challenge in the search for a digital and efficient industry.},

Due to the complexity of the changing farm ecosystem, the new technological revolution's benefits will not be shared evenly. It is necessary to understand the problems and challenges that need to be addressed so that all countries fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0. This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0. Besides, research helps broaden the inclusive debate that can shape the introduction of agriculture 4.0.},

We describe a Cross Reality system, designed to improve efficiency and ergonomics in industrial environments that require manual assembly operations. Our objective is to reduce the high costs of authoring assembly manuals and to improve the process of skills transfer, in particular, in assembly tasks that include workers with disabilities. The automation of short-lived assembly tasks, i.e., manufacturing of limited batches of customized products, does not yield significant returns considering the automation effort necessary and the production time frame. In the design of our XR system, we discuss how aspects of content creation can be automated for short-lived tasks and how seamless interoperability between devices facilitates skills transfer in human-machine hybrid environments.},

A representative of each class of the stakeholders is studied in depth, and the problems that they are facing with respect to implementation are identified. It turns out that a substantial chunk of the macrolevel implementation issues faced by all stakeholders are situated on the threads of one-to-one interactions of these stakeholders, with collaboration and standardization issues enveloping these one-to-one interactions. We propose a framework for formulating solution recommendations for these macroissues and give an example of its use.},

In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides to smart buildings novel mechanisms to embed Internet of Things (IoT) architectures, as well as to perform end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing between project actors. However, this openness and high decentralization of BIM and IoT services of smart buildings leads to several security issues that the use of Blockchain has been proved to provide an effective layer of data protection. This paper examines the interconnection and interoperability of BIM, IoT, Blockchain and advanced digital technologies in the demanding environment of a museum, where efficient and secure monitoring and management are critical factors that should be satisfied. It focuses on the application of the aforementioned technologies in the context of a building that has to deal with multiple administrative requirements, the management and protection of the exhibition areas and the objects exposed in them, the security and the convenience of the visitors, the financial management of the tickets and the profits from museum shops, the workshops, the laboratories and the storage areas, which usually contain numerous invaluable artifacts.},

This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics. Finally, we look at some tradeoffs for analytics in the IoT that can shape future research.},

  abstract       = {3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology's benefits. This technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Current food system evolved in a great degree because of the development of processing and food engineering technologies: people learned to bake bread long before the advent of agriculture; salting and smoking supported nomad lifestyles; canning allowed for longer military marches; etc. Food processing technologies went through evolution and significant optimization and currently rely on minor fraction of energy comparing with initial prototypes. Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies.},

  abstract       = {Cyber incident response within Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is characterised by high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability and requires a multi-disciplined team that encompasses personnel business operations, Operational Technology (OT), IT, security operations and media engagement to be effective. Such teams require a dynamic decision framework to allow ICS operators to maintain services during the recovery of full operating capability. There is empirical evidence that static incident response playbooks do not provide enough flexibility in their definition to support situations outside of the scope of their initial definition, and that they have been ignored when cyber incidents have occurred. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with ICS incident response professional identified three main areas of concern: communication, information sharing between knowledge areas, and achieving external buy-in. The Agile Incident Response for Industrial Control Systems (AIR4ICS) framework has been developed to integrate Agile techniques into the Cyber Security domain of incident response. AIR4ICS provides a dynamic approach to improve situational awareness, information sharing, collective decision-making and response flexibility within the unique context of ICS. The techniques used in AIR4ICS were initially shaped by interviews with professionals with experience of protecting ICS, structured using the Scrum methodology, and refined through a series of Cyber Incident Response exercises with Incident Response professionals facing-off against specialist ICS Red Teams. AIR4ICS has resulted in a framework that provides a modular approach that can be adapted to fit the working practices, skillsets and priorities of individual organisations. The framework improves communication, promotes information sharing between knowledge areas, and increases external buy-in. Ultimately, AIR4ICS provides a dynamic decision framework that allows Incident Response Teams to manage uncertainty and unpredictability to reduce the time taken to restore normal operations.},

With the development of computing power, innovative algorithms, and gathering of massive data, AI will be rejuvenated in the next decade and become one of the most important enabling technologies for 5G automation. How to use the powerful analysis, judgment, and prediction capabilities provided by the AI algorithms to enable 5G equipment, networks and service systems, and combine them with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of carriers' networks become an important topic in the ICT industry. Based on deep understanding, accumulated experience in telecom field, and long-term investment in AI strategies, many organizations have been introducing AI technology to telecom networks and contributing to development of standards essential for improving the quality and security of AI products and services, ensuring user safety and creating a fair and open industry ecosystem. 5G networks can be automatically deployed (automatic service deployment and automatic running) with the introduction of AI based on application scenarios. AI algorithms can also be used for self-healing (automatic fault recovery), self-optimization (network self-optimization) and creating autonomous 5G systems (self-evolving networks), which continuously improve network efficiency and reduce OPEX. This article aims at presenting the most relevant use cases, prominent research outcomes, latest standard developments and related standardization gaps, examples of AI strategy interpretation, AI solutions – including communication intelligent platform, AI model service, and deployment solution – and typical application scenarios. As a part of this framework, this article introduces the most important aspects of AI security, in terms of protecting the integrity and confidentiality of AI models and data, and thus preventing attackers from changing the inference results or stealing data.},

In this paper, we address a shortcoming in the extant literature, which presents an abundance of roadmaps for digitalization but very few addressing this in combination with lean. As such, we present a learning roadmap for digital lean manufacturing, with a core focus on cybersecurity. The roadmap has been developed and tested by combining theory with practical insights at the Norwegian Catapult Lean4zero Lab, Norway’s first and only full-scale digital lean simulator.},

In the case of the Pohang Earthquake, the ground is losing its resistance and the ground liquefaction phenomenon that is behaving like a liquid is officially reported. In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.},

In this paper, we consider a new architecture of digital twin empowered Industrial IoT, in which digital twins capture characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning tasks of industrial scenarios. A trust-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of digital twins deviation and emphasize the contribution of high-performance clients. Based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning, we propose a federated learning framework that adaptively adjusts the aggregation frequency to improve the learning performance under resource constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed framework outperforms the benchmark in terms of learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.},

Industry 4.0 is, however, still in the state of infancy and conceptual state wherein it is not clear as to how to incorporate many dynamic technological concepts in different sectors. Previous studies have conceptually delineated the benefits, challenges, and CSFs of Industry 4.0, however, there is yet to be an empirical study that critically examines the differences in benefits, challenges, and critical success factors (CSFs) of Industry 4.0 in both manufacturing and service industries and rank them. This study through an online survey captures the view of senior management professionals who have experience in Industry 4.0 implementation in major companies in Asia, Europe, and North America. 96 senior management professionals participated in this study through an online survey. The qualitative data on benefits and challenges were analysed using thematic analyses. The quantitative data on critical success factors were ranked using the normalisation of the mean to find the most important factors. Further agreement analysis was conducted in the manufacturing and service sectors for the CSFs. This study identifies the top five benefits and challenges in the manufacturing and service industries. The CSFs for Industry 4.0 was put forward and ranked in both the manufacturing and service industries.},

Answering the demands of critical IoT (Internet of Things), and mass IoT application users - beside lifting mobile broadband to the next level - remains the challenge for 5G. While generic, high level targets for KPIs are widely communicated, it is not yet well-understood how the various demands can affect the traffic mixture. Both the radio- and the core-domains of the cellular network have to cope with traffic peaks, and have to obey various QoS (Quality of Service) guarantees. In order to do this, traffic-related characteristics should be determined, and this knowledge should be used during network planning, optimization and service shaping.This paper aims to provide insights to user behavioral patterns for these three key application areas: mobile broadband, critical IoT and mass IoT. Since traffic volume- and burst-related user behaviour is not expected to change suddenly, current, targeted data collection on 4G links would provide a good basic insight for future, 5G usage - at least as traffic patterns. We collected live 4G network data then analyzed throughout this paper in order to show traffic patterns - and their distinguishing features - for the three key 5G application areas.},

  volume         = {9},
  abstract       = {The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

  abstract       = {Sustainability and digital transformation represent two of the main trends of the last decade. More in detail, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Circular Economy (CE) are two key concepts that are characterizing the present and that will shape the future. From the extant literature review emerges that, although academics identify a possible synergy between these topics, a concrete integrated framework able to achieve CE at systemic level is still missing. The objective of this research is to put in relation the I4.0 and CE paradigms to understand the link between the two topics and envisage a new framework focused on circularity among supply chains. Therefore, a systematic literature review on CE, I4.0 and on their mutual relationship have been conducted to investigate which are the synergies and how the new I4.0 technologies support the implementation of CE at supply chains network level. Hence, a framework in which I4.0 technologies support the adoption of Reduce, Redesign, Recycling and Remanufacturing strategies has been developed. Indeed, starting from the 6Rs’ model (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, Redesign, Remanufacture), the focus has been shifted towards these 4Rs since they have been considered the most affected by I4.0. Regarding the use of I4.0 technologies, Cloud Manufacturing (MaaS) and Additive Manufacturing have been deemed the most enabling technologies. Indeed, they allow to respectively aggregate resources and reduce wastes. The framework is supported by a quantitative analysis of economic and environmental impacts that results in the definition of a Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (MOILP). The framework works in closing the loop by acting as strategic node able to link different supply chains. It has been developed focusing on discrete manufacturing and replicable in different sectors. Finally, the model identified has been supported by some pilot assessments through semi-structured interviews.},

'Digital Manufacturing' continues the concept of 'Computer Integrated Manufacturing' announced in the 1970s on the basis of, available, Internet-based technologies. The digital transformation should strengthen the competitiveness of commercial enterprises, while enabling desirable ways of working at the same time. The digital transformation is an opportunity to shed some light on the role of the human individual in digital manufacturing and the business development potential of a human-centered work design. Measures taken to adapt work to people refer to technical-ergonomic conditions and/or to substantive-organizational conditions of the work activity. Immersion, that is, complete immersion in the virtual world by means of head-mounted displays or projections, addresses as many human senses as possible, in order to achieve a realistic simulation. The digital transformation is changing human work and workload patterns.},

A set of advanced technologies for digitalisation and a theory-based set of seven value drivers for PSM are identified for the proposed grid to facilitate the design of applications and interventions for digitalising PSM. The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {Industrie 4.0 environments generate an unprecedented amount of production data. This is due to the rising number of sensors and interconnected devices capable of emitting data in millisecond frequencies. Streaming analytics offers promising methodologies that can support handling and analysis of data volume and variety. Transparency and control over real-time data can increase production efficiency in tightly connected machine environments. Data transparency may avoid time-consuming assessment of machines to detect anomalous machine behavior causing production inefficiencies or failures. This paper aims to identify requirements to implement streaming analytics for the detection of anomalies in Industrie 4.0 production machine groups through a structured literature review.},

The complexity associated with designing a connected product or experience often causes its architect to focus almost exclusively on the enabling technology itself as opposed to the actual design and end user experience—the value or utility—that they create it for. We walk through fundamental design principles. This paper provides principles, frameworks, recommendations, and resources to ensure human-centered and user experience-led design for the IoT.},

As Ellerton (2014) explained in her JRME editorial, our field is like a growing tree, stable and strong in its roots yet becoming more vast and diverse because of a number of factors. Such growth begs these questions: Is our research solving significant problems? How do we create a system and infrastructure that will provide an opportunity to accumulate professional knowledge that is storable and shareable as we work together to address significant problems (Hiebert, Gallimore, &amp; Stigler, 2002)?

Practice-orientation refers to efforts that have resulted in positive impact and transformations in the delivery of healthcare. The review is epochal in the sense that there have been 3 major stages of innovation and diffusion in digital health that are identified. The year 1998 was deemed a significant starting point for the literature search because it marked the introduction of the term e-health. The main objective of this review is to track the evolution of digital health and the conspicuous developments in the field - crucial steps to get a grasp of the key issues involving the delivery of healthcare. The article includes a general discussion of these various key issues and sensitizing concepts. The sense-making thus shed some light on the areas of enquiry, which are central to identifying the direction in which the practice of healthcare is headed. These areas of enquiry often referred to as ‘substantive areas’ in qualitative research terminology, were identified as ‘electronic medical records’, ‘health cloud’, ‘data analytics’, ‘Internet-enabled devices’, and other ‘emerging information technologies’. The article concludes with a synthesis of key inferences drawn from the epochal review. The digital disruption of healthcare has created necessary conditions for its offering as a global, interoperable service.},

We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.},

Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.},

To be able to achieve that in the relatively short time given by the social demand, we need to assess, evaluate and establish a combination of new, emerging and existing skills pools to define future job roles and skills required for the design, production and maintenance of cars. Mapping these skills onto the phases of engineering, production, and maintenance in the automotive life cycle outlines an interesting future picture of a vehicle that will integrate smart technologies, smart production, smart maintenance and continuous machine learning. In this paper the job roles supporting this future are proposed and discussed.},

  abstract       = {The rapid pace of digitalisation within the Construction Industry and the divergence from traditional practice inherent to this transformation requires the development of new knowledge to frame these emerging practices. Acting on increasing digitalisation pressures, many national and international standards, protocols, and specifications have been generated with little conceptual framing or with no theoretical underpinning. This positioning paper responds to practical business needs of organisations and project teams, builds upon existing conceptual constructs, and delivers a modular information management framework. The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components - information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers – which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes – and aims to predict - information flows across an asset's lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.},

Our study goes beyond existing research, including our own previous work, by focusing on all relevant IoT/IIoT solution components relating to development and operation. Specifically, we discuss the communication standards, messaging protocol standards, and communication platforms; device control, integration and simulation frameworks; tools and frameworks for modeling, development and deployment; and IoT cloud integration platforms that support IoT solutions. By highlighting the features as well as the advantages and limitations of different IoT solutions, this technical analysis can prove useful to IoT practitioners designing IoT and IIoT systems with diverse requirements; to students further learning about IoT/IIOT vision; and to researchers interested in understanding the current limitations of the IoT/IIoT landscape and developing new standards, tools, frameworks and platforms for future application.},

In this article, we consider a new architecture of digital twin (DT) empowered Industrial IoT, where DTs capture the characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning. Noticing that DTs may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of industrial IoT, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed framework is superior to the benchmark in terms of learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.},

  abstract       = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV), when empowered by aerial communications, provides vehicles with seamless connections and proximate computing services. The unpredictable network dynamics of aerial-assisted IoV pose challenges to the resource allocation. In this paper, dynamic digital twin (DT) of aerial-assisted IoV is established to capture the time-varying resource supply and demands, so that unified resource scheduling and allocation can be performed. We design a two-stage incentive mechanism for resource allocation based on Stackelberg game where DT of vehicles or road side units (RSUs) is deemed as the leader, and the RSUs who provide computing services are as the follower. In the first stage incentive, we determine the computing resources that RSUs are willing to offer according to vehicles’ preferences. To further maximize the satisfaction of vehicles and the overall energy efficiency, a distributed incentive mechanism based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then designed, in which the resource allocation policy for each vehicle is optimized. Thanks to ADMM, the incentive mechanism can be run at multiple RSUs in parallel to reduce delay and relieve the computational burden of UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the satisfaction of vehicles and the energy efficiency at the same time.},

  abstract       = {Abstract Nowadays, the market competition becomes increasingly fierce due to diversified customer needs, stringent environmental requirements, and global competitors. One of the most important factors for companies to not only survive but also thrive in today’s competitive market is their logistics performance. This paper aims, through a systematic literature analysis of 115 papers from 2012 to 2020, at presenting quantitative insights and comprehensive overviews of the current and future research landscapes of sustainable logistics in the Industry 4.0 era. The results show that Industry 4.0 technologies provide opportunities for improving the economic efficiency, environmental performance, and social impact of logistics sectors. However, several challenges arise with this technological transformation, i.e., trade-offs among different sustainability indicators, unclear benefits, lifecycle environmental impact, inequity issues, and technology maturity. Thus, to better tackle the current research gaps, future suggestions are given to focus on the balance among different sustainability indicators through the entire lifecycle, human-centric technological transformation, system integration and digital twin, semi-autonomous transportation solutions, smart reverse logistics, and so forth.},

  abstract       = {Blockchain appears to still be nascent in its growth and a relatively untapped asset. This research investigates the need of blockchain in Industry 4.0 environment from Big Data perspective in supply chain management. The research method used in this study involves a combination of an Action Research method and Case Study research. More specifically, the action research method was applied in two industry case studies that implemented and tested the designed architecture in a global logistics environment. Case Study A examined the blockchain application in cross-border cargo movements whereas Case Study B investigated the application in a liquid chemical logistics company serving to petroleum industries. Our research analysis has identified that the Case A subject had disconnected systems and services for blockchain wherein the big data interactions had failed (failure case). Whereas in Case B, the company has achieved nearly 25% increase in revenue through its customer service after the blockchain implementation and thereby reduction in paperwork and carbon emissions (success case). This research contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge to big data and blockchain by identifying key implementation guideline and issues for blockchain in supply chain management. Further, action-based research coupled with a case study approach has been used to evaluate the application aspects of the architecture's scalability and functionality of bigdata and blockchain in supply chain management.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, the need for Operational Technology (OT) defenses has been recognized, serving as an additional line of defense when Information Technology (IT) defenses are bypassed. This is no longer considered an uncommon possibility when dealing with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors expected to be state-sponsored and receiving insider assistance. In these extreme adversarial situations, OT defenses aim to provide another layer of defense for the system, introduced directly at the physical process level, as described by the sensors data, the system model, and control actions. Just like IT defenses, two schools of thought, i.e., passive and active defenses, have emerged to address this challenge. In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors.},

Sustainable supply chain visibility is premised on sharing of mutually benefiting information, to achieve associated sustainability objectives including those related to economic, environmental and social goals. Sustainable supply chains strive for distinctive visibility with its attendant benefits that include improving and strengthening the supply chain for competitive advantage. Advances in technology such as blockchain technology can help facilitate effective management of sustainable supply chain visibility and in delivering associated benefits. The relational characteristics of blockchain and sustainable supply chain visibility has recently been reported in the literature with some emphasis on the capacity, capability and context of sustainable supply chain visibility. This paper explores a notion of context-awareness and blockchain in relation to sustainable supply chain visibility. A landscape for an architecture of a blockchain-based sustainable supply chain visibility management platform centred on context-awareness is suggested. The main thrust of the considerations is provisioning of secure, auditable and mutually benefiting sustainable supply chain information sharing, for distinctive visibility, in heterogeneous context-aware scenarios whilst recognising the underlying characteristics of sustainable supply chain visibility.},

  abstract       = {Digital Twin is a way to virtually represent or model a physical object using the real time data. This innovation sets up a way to deal with industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name suggests, “Digital Twin infers that a reproduction of the product is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data, processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the successful working of the products geographically distributed. The impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital twin. The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use. Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the virtual machine without the need of a specific training. With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting, organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud. It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and process it effectively.},

  abstract       = {&lt;p&gt;Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) has an important role in communication between devices in strategic industries such as power plant grid/network. Besides, the SCADA system is now open to any external heterogeneous networks to facilitate monitoring of industrial equipment, but this causes a new vulnerability in the SCADA network system. Any disruption on the SCADA system will give rise to a dangerous impact on industrial devices. Therefore, deep research and development of reliable intrusion detection system (IDS) for SCADA system/network is required. Via a thorough literature review, this paper firstly discusses current security issues of SCADA system and look closely benchmark dataset and SCADA security holes, followed by SCADA traffic anomaly recognition using artificial intelligence techniques and visual traffic monitoring system. Then, touches on the encryption technique suitable for the SCADA network. In the end, this paper gives the trend of SCADA IDS in the future and provides a proposed model to generate a reliable IDS, this model is proposed based on the investigation of previous researches. This paper focuses on SCADA systems that use IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol and distributed network protocol version 3 (DNP3) protocol as many SCADA systems use these two protocols.&lt;/p&gt;},

The last chapter reaches overarching conclusions and reflections from the integrated chain perspective by combining the findings from the preceding chapters. The next big challenge will be the transformation to (digitized) multicountry networked ecosystems. First, the last chapter gives an overview of the remaining key issues in maritime supply chains, hampering the transition from a linear maritime supply chain thinking toward a network industry. It furthermore provides solutions for handling those problems. Second, following Finger and Jaag 2015, the reshaping of the maritime supply chain is discussed from the industry, policy, and management perspectives. Last, some scenarios of how the industry should evolve from partner collaboration (one-to-one collaboration) to a maritime supply network (many-to-many collaboration) are discussed. From a business perspective, this trend of (maritime) actors banding together platform-enabled ecosystems can leverage their strengths and competitiveness.},

Therefore, economic growth should always go hand in hand with each industrial revolution. In this context, the increasing demand for electricity, the non-renewable nature of conventional sources and the rising price of fuel, are considered the constraints of the 21st century and need to be definitively managed in order to meet the constantly increasing demand for electricity from the population in the best possible conditions. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are the foundation on which tomorrow’s innovative solutions are created. However, smart embedded systems and the internet are two major players driving ICT technologies forward. These technologies have impacted several sectors, where we find a crossroads of several industrial sectors: medical, manufacturing, automation, energy and others. The application these technologies in a smart grid framework with the integration of renewable energy sources and used for an optimization and efficiency mission let Internet of Things (IoT) to take the sustainable and industrial character and named Green Industrial Internet of Things (GIIoT). This last, seems to be a promoting axis for the development of future applications. In this paper, we present an overview of the impact of the Internet of Things on the evolution of applications in relation to the different revolutions, an inventory of the different industrial revolutions, an overview of the GIIoT as well as some applications and perspectives.},

However, the application of such simulations is limited, unless numerical models can be automatically constructed from the data. In this study, we develop a program that utilizes a data processing platform to read, transform, and integrate data to create mediated data with a common data structure. This mediated data can be used to construct analytical models for various numerical analyses. Using the program developed, a grid model of 3-D ground surface as the mediated data was constructed based on borehole data obtained through a ground survey. Each grid point has basic material parameters of soil, and these parameters are estimated from borehole data and other investigation reports. Each grid point has general geotechnical parameters and can be easily converted to a 3-D finite-element model. When the borehole data is added or changed, the analytical model can be updated with almost no cost, whereas it would be very costly to create the model manually.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, the applications of industrial robots are expanding rapidly due to Industry 4.0 oriented evolutions, ranging from automobile industry to almost all manufacturing domains. As demands with rapid product iterations become increasingly fluctuant and customized, the assembly process of industrial robots faces new challenges including dynamic reorganization and reconfiguration, ubiquitous sensing, and communication with time constraints, etc. This paper studies the industrial robot assembly process modeling, planning, and scheduling based on real-time data acquisition and fusion under the framework of advanced shop-floor communication and computing technologies such as wireless sensor, actuator network, and edge computing. Taking the assembly of industrial robots as the specific object, the multi-agent model of industrial robot assemble process is established. Then, the encapsulation, communication, and interaction of agents with real-time data acquisition and fusion are studied. Based on multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, an intelligent planning and scheduling algorithm for industrial robot assembly is proposed, and a simulation case is presented to demonstrate the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract       = {Recently, as the development of information technologies and personalized needs, the Industrial Internet platform based manufacturing service collaboration becomes the main method for manufacturing collaboration, where multiple interest-independent stakeholders involve. However, the distrust between stakeholders and the platform (distrust among collaborators and the doubts of data accuracy) hinders the development of it. Manufacturing service that are mainly encapsulated by static information cannot well adapt to changing physical conditions, which will disappoint the stakeholders for data accuracy. In addition, distrust among unfamiliar stakeholders is also the reason to keep users away from the platform. Digital twin (DT) and blockchain (BC) technologies have been widely studied in many fields, as they can provide a trustful method for the process of cyber-physical integration. In view of the insufficient interaction of physical and cyber spaces and distrust challenges encountered in the development of the current Industrial Internet platform based manufacturing service collaboration, this paper proposes a DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service collaboration mechanism towards the Industrial Internet platform. In addition, based on the analysis of manufacturing collaboration development, the DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service management, challenges, and future work of implementing DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service management for the Industrial Internet Platform are discussed.},

  abstract       = {Existing platforms for collaborative BIM design have a centralized system architecture, which suffers cybersecurity risks of design data manipulation and denial of access, leading to a loss of data traceability, a decline in design productivity, and project delays. Blockchain is a promising technology to solve such risks by providing decentralized and immutable data storage. However, integrating blockchain with BIM faces a problem that blockchain is inherently unsuitable for storing large-sized design files like BIM models, hindering blockchain from protecting BIM data integrity. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example. Results show that: (1) DCDE is a feasible solution for secure design collaboration, and (2) DCDE latency (in millisecond-level), TPS (60 transactions per second), and storage cost (12.5 KB per day) are within an acceptable range.},

The consequential increasing share of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, is creating further challenges for the stable production, transmission, and distribution of electricity. The historical pyramidal model is being progressively replaced by an ecosystem of multiple stakeholders, with the result that the balancing of energy supply and demand can no longer be managed by a centralized system: smart grids are rapidly becoming a prerequisite for renewable energy to become dominant. However, the current energy regulation is forcing players in the value chain to operate in isolation, while smart grids require data sharing between the stakeholders. Creating collaborative ecosystems between energy players is the only way to enter the next era for energy.},

However, remanufacturing systems are faced with many challenges that are not typically found in traditional manufacturing systems. Inspired by the need to better understand their idiosyncrasies, particular needs and implications, this paper aims to scrutinise current issues and concerns about digital transformation in the remanufacturing systems. In particular, the paper reviews the extant literature to observe: (1) how the I4.0 technologies have so far been used in remanufacturing and (2) the benefits and risks that need to be considered by remanufacturers when adopting the I4.0 technologies. We have elucidated the significance of our findings and subsequently synthesised our thoughts into eight propositions that demystify the mechanisms of how the I4.0 technologies can bring potential benefits when used by remanufacturers to accomplish a portfolio of remanufacturing tasks, and the risks they need to be aware of. This articulation represents contributions to knowledge as it will set out the underpinning of the future human-technology collaboration, which is key in the I4.0 realm.},

To partially address some of these problems, this paper presents an approach for physically linking engineered cells to their digital footprint-we called it digital twinning. This enables the tracking of the entire engineering history of a cell line in a specialized version control system for collaborative strain engineering via simple barcoding protocols.},

  abstract       = {Data-driven models for industrial energy savings heavily rely on sensor data, experimentation data and knowledge-based data. This work reveals that too much research attention was invested in making data-driven models, as supposed to ensuring the quality of industrial data. Furthermore, the true challenge within the Industry 4.0 is with data communication and infrastructure problems, not so significantly on developing modelling techniques. Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry. The novelty of this work is the current context of industrial energy savings was extended towards cutting-edge technologies for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this work proposes to standardize and modularize industrial data infrastructure for smart energy savings. This work also serves as a concise guideline for researchers and industrialists who are looking to implement advanced energy-saving systems.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.},

Due to the importance of the systems, they are potential targets for attackers trying to take control over the critical processes. Attackers use various vulnerabilities of such systems including specific vulnerabilities of AI components. It is important to make sure that inappropriate adversarial content will not break the security walls and will not harm the decision logic of critical systems. We believe that the corresponding security toolset must be organized as a trainable self-protection mechanism similar to immunity. We found certain similarities between digital vs. biological immunity and we study the possibilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to provide the basis for the digital immunity training. We suggest the taxonomy of GANs (including new architectures) suitable to simulate various aspects of the immunity for Industry 4.0 applications.},

The question of what will the cities of the future look like is at the heart of urban studies. In parallel, a similar question is posed by (trans)humanists about the future of humanity and its possible technological enhancements. However, (trans)humanity and future cities are defined in a bi-directional dependency. Therefore, we have to answer the questions of future humans and cities simultaneously. This paper maps several ways of interacting between transhuman communities and smart cities to understand their possible effects on governing, design and society at large resulting in a framework that will work as a cautionary tale and an inspirational blueprint for imagining future urbanity.},

An important aspect of this is the understanding and evaluation of the progress of the workflows that are to be executed. Methods for this require both an appropriate choice of sensors, as well as algorithms capable of quickly and efficiently evaluating activity and workflow progress.In this paper we present such an algorithm, which provides activity and workflow recognition using both depth and RGB cameras as input. The algorithm's main purpose is to be used in an industrial training station, allowing novice workers to learn the necessary steps in assembling nordic ski products without the need for human supervision. We will describe how the algorithm recognizes predefined workflows in the sensor data, and present a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance on a real data recording of operators performing their work in an industrial setting. We will show that the algorithm fulfills the necessary requirements and is ready to be implemented in the training station application.},

The greatest advantages of Industry 4.0 are the empowerment of sustainable growth, thanks to the optimization of resources, and the integration of the supply chain. Nevertheless, Industry 4.0 challenges industries on the organizational level, concerning the integration of these technologies with existing ones and the management of digital tools by dedicated qualified people. Steel industries have also absorbed the challenges and the advantages of Industry 4.0. Digital technologies are affecting the business model and supply chain of steel producers, pushing them to integrate themselves with their business partners.

Missions are based on clear targets that can help mitigating grand challenges. Based on the results of the Italian Flagship Project Factories of the Future, this chapter proposes seven missions while identifying the societal impact, the technological and industrial challenges, and the barriers to be overcome. These missions cover topics such as circular economy, rapid and sustainable industrialisation, robotic assistant, factories for personalised medicine, internet of actions, factories close to the people, and turning ideas into products. The accomplishment of missions asks for the support of a proper research environment in terms of infrastructures to test and demonstrate the results to a wide public. Research infrastructures together with funding mechanisms will be better addressed in the next chapter of this book.},

The proposed methodology is oriented towards considering groupings of projects that present an appreciable dynamic towards an incipient or developing district “cluster. The assessment (classification) refers to the degree of evolution achieved at present and the near future, which facilitates discussion of the conditions of each grouping. The most economically important base metal region, the Iberian Pyritic Belt (IPB), indicates positive conditions for a successful cluster according to the new methodology implemented.

Due to discrepancies between the requirements of IoT systems and the characteristics of BC networks, the motivations and design of these blockchain-enabled IoT systems (BC-IoT) are not only intriguing from a research perspective but also invaluable in practice. This paper presents an inductive study of the “why and “how of BC-IoT systems through a Systematic Literature Review of 120 peer-reviewed studies. To capture the diverse nature of BC-IoT integration, we proposed and applied a multi-perspective framework to analyse the existing systems. Regarding their motivations, we studied the improvement objectives and technical problems that drive the integration of BC. Regarding the design, we captured the position of BC within IoT systems as well as the content and processes that IoT systems offload to BC. As these dimensions are not mutually exclusive, they constitute a rich and multi-angle view of BC-IoT integration. Based on these findings, we defined 10 archetypes of BC-IoT systems that embody the core patterns of usage and configuration of BC in IoT systems.},

However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions. It is a technology-agnostic three-layered model, which reconciles existing understandings of DT under a common umbrella. We also derive an operational architecture as a possible implementation of the framework, which we demonstrate on two use cases. The large adoption of such a framework will draw a clear line between what is a DT and what is not, while establishing a high-level standard model for DT engineering.},

The key to automation and integration is a Real Estate Data Marketplace across the lifespan of finance, planning, construction, regulation, management, even refurbishment and demolition. Integration of digital 4.0 and industry 4.0. Real estate is becoming increasingly digital, automated and integrated; embracing connected-buildings, wearable personal devices, integrated transportation systems, buildings and infrastructure data management and smart cities. The key to promoting the use of data-driven techniques in the real estate sector is the introduction of a Data Marketplace that promotes validation of data and tokenisation to create value for the owners of the data, Blockchain security and governance for users of the data, the application of Artificial Intelligence for data analytics and ethics for governance. The technical capability exists today for a complete end-to-end reshaping of the real estate market based on data and ethics. This is data-driven real estate (cf. Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent). The contributions of this review paper are fourfold: (a) to provide a vision of a fully digital real estate marketplace; (b) to brief the industry on digital technology and also stimulate engagement with the computer science community; (c) to encourage debate amongst professionals, academics and politicians of the benefits of full automation and integration of real estate; (d) present ethics for the Real Estate Data Marketplace based on lawfulness, fairness and transparency.},

This shift stems from several features relevant to Industry 4.0, specifically the increase of the importance of the digital world and the fostering of the development of more autonomous and intelligent systems that will interact and interoperate with humans in more open production environments. The first aim of this paper is to study to what extent Industry 4.0 impacts ethics. The second one is to raise the awareness of researchers regarding potential ethical risks when designing and evaluating future Industry 4.0 compliant production systems. For that purpose, the ethical stakes of industry 4.0 are first presented. Then, an overview of related work is done to evaluate the different scientific fields potentially contributing to the study of the ethical dimension in Industry 4.0. A discussion is finally proposed from this overview. The main conclusion of this discussion concerns the urgent need to address the ethical dimension of scientific contributions relevant to Industry 4.0, given the lack of work in that field.},

Thanks to such an initiative, 30 undergraduate students brought their knowledge into local companies to support them in understanding Industry 4.0 basic concepts and analyzing their maturity level. In particular, the research shows the training program on the assessment model and its practical application conducted by students in one company from the region of Tuscany. The knowledge transfer process to support companies in understanding their Industry 4.0 maturity level can be one way through which higher education institutions can support the business environment. Companies can support students in translating such knowledge in best practices and concrete solutions that can be valuable for growing the professional profile of the students themselves, and for developing the company's processes and business models.},

A total of 3159 blockchain-related articles published through August 5, 2019, were gathered from the Web of Science. In all, 2478 articles formed the citation network, 27 of which were on the key route. These 27 key papers on blockchain represented the four developmental stages. Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.},

  abstract       = {Today, the built environment is designed, built, and managed using digital technology, making it increasingly exposed to cyber security risks. Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures.},

  abstract       = {Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the largest electronics market for hardware production due to its fast evolving application space. However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing.},

A more accurate assessment of the security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges (CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented CRs and TBs platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented CRs and TBs research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future of CRs and TBs. The taxonomy elaborates on the CRs/TBs dimensions, as well as, highlighting a diminishing differentiation between application areas.},

  abstract       = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.},

Despite their promised utility, user perception about accepting online information through REOPs is unexplored. Using a comprehensive questionnaire and data collected from 65 users, the current study captures the users’ perception of REOPs. Risk, service, information, system, technology adoption model (RSISTAM) is proposed comprising of seven users’ perceptions: risk (PR), service quality (PSEQ), information quality (PIQ), and system quality (PSYQ) from the information systems success model, and usefulness (PU), ease of use (PEU) and behaviour to accept (BAU) from TAM. The results are analysed using the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach, which shows that PIQ, PSEQ and PEU are the causes and PR, PSYQ, PU and BAU are the effects. Among the criteria, the order of prominence is PEU > PSEQ > PIQ, and for net effects, the order is PU > BAU > PSYQ > PR. For addressing the causes, the REOP managers must provide more transparent, high quality and voluminous information to the users, focus on the system, services, and information qualities, and add more enjoyable, immersive and easy-to-use content through REOPs. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring user perceptions and proposing methods to improve the quality and reliability of REOPs in line with Real Estate 4.0 and industry 4.0 aims.},

  abstract       = {The availability of data from a manufacturing operation can be used to enable an increase in capability, adaptability, and awareness of the process. In current cyber-physical systems, data are collected from pieces of manufacturing equipment and used to drive useful change and affect production output. The data gathered typically describe the operating state of the equipment, such as a machine tool, and can be provided using standard protocols. One such protocol, known as MTConnect, is becoming increasingly popular to collect data from machine tools. Other useful data can be collected from production personnel using a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to monitor process output, consumable usage, and operator productivity. However, MTConnect data and MES data usually reside in separate systems that may be proprietary and expensive. This paper describes the development and implementation of a new MES, powered by Android devices and cloud computing tools, that combines MTConnect data with production data collected from operators; the proposed MES is particularly suitable for small manufacturing enterprises, as it is low-cost and easily implementable. A case study using the MES to track a production run of titanium parts is presented, and data from the MES are correlated with MTConnect data from a machine tool. This work is integral to realizing a complete digital model of the shop floor, known as the Shop Floor Digital Twin, that can be used for production control and optimization.},

  title = {A BPM Lifecycle Plug-in for Modeling Methods Agility},
  year  = {2020},
  abstract       = {Business Process Management literature has proposed several BPM lifecycles on a level of abstraction that is "modeling method"-agnostic, i.e. they consider the modeling language and tool support an underlying invariant or technological concern. While remaining on the same abstraction layer, we highlight a "method agility" requirement observed in commercial BPM consulting projects - concretely, it manifests as change requests for the modeling language or tool, from one lifecycle iteration to the next, leading to situations of "model value co-creation" as customer demands are assimilated in the modeling method. Based on a conceptualization of such situations, a lifecycle "plug-in" is proposed in the form of a methodology and associated tool support, allowing for responsive evolution of the adopted modeling method with impact on several lifecycle phases. Historical examples from the evolution of a BPM product are provided to illustrate and classify the demands that motivate the existence of this "lifecycle plug-in".},

  abstract       = {This paper deals with the design and implementation of a universal cyber-physical model capable of simulating any production process in order to optimize its logistics systems. The basic idea is the direct possibility of testing and debugging advanced logistics algorithms using a digital twin outside the production line. Since the digital twin requires a physical connection to a real line for its operation, this connection is substituted by a modular cyber-physical system (CPS), which replicates the same physical inputs and outputs as a real production line. Especially in fully functional production facilities, there is a trend towards optimizing logistics systems in order to increase efficiency and reduce idle time. Virtualization techniques in the form of a digital twin are standardly used for this purpose. The possibility of an initial test of the physical implementation of proposed optimization changes before they are fully implemented into operation is a pragmatic question that still resonates on the production side. Such concerns are justified because the proposed changes in the optimization of production logistics based on simulations from a digital twin tend to be initially costly and affect the existing functional production infrastructure. Therefore, we created a universal CPS based on requirements from our cooperating manufacturing companies. The model fully physically reproduces the real conditions of simulated production and verifies in advance the quality of proposed optimization changes virtually by the digital twin. Optimization costs are also significantly reduced, as it is not necessary to verify the optimization impact directly in production, but only in the physical model. To demonstrate the versatility of deployment, we chose a configuration simulating a robotic assembly workplace and its logistics.},

The data collected can be stored, for example, into private, public, or hybrid cloud service infrastructure or distributed service by utilizing data platforms. The stored data can be used when implementing services, such as building automation (BAS). Cloud services, IoT sensors, and data platforms can face several kinds of cybersecurity attack vectors such as adversarial, AI-based, DoS/DDoS, insider attacks. If a perpetrator can penetrate the defenses of a data platform, she can cause significant harm to the system. For example, the perpetrator can disrupt a building’s automatic heating system or break the heating equipment by using a suitable attack vector for a data platform. This chapter focuses on examining possibilities to protect cloud storage or data platforms from incoming cyberattacks by using, for instance, artificial-intelligence-based tools or trained neural networks that can detect and prevent typical attack vectors.},

To meet this need, there are systems called cyber ranges that can be seen as an exemplification of a digital network twin. SPIDER is a cyber range specially oriented to train experts in next-generation network cybersecurity. In this paper we present how SPIDER is augmenting cyber range environments with ML tools, how it works and the way in which it can be used to train new experts.},

One of the common features of these industries is that production processes are implemented on the basis of large-scale infrastructure facilities. This chapter discusses the study and analysis of the behavior of large-scale systems based on system analysis methods. Large-scale systems for the extraction, transportation, and refining of oil and gas are considered. The characteristic types of hazards for mentioned systems are discussed. The problem of complexity of the analysis of the structure of large systems is considered. Examples of models of large systems in the form of graphs are given. The application of a hierarchical approach to the construction of a system for monitoring and managing the safety of technological processes is discussed. It is noted that the professional competence of the staff of large systems, the observance of safety standards significantly affects the processes of control of emergence of critical situations. At each stage of the life cycle of a complex system, large amounts of data are generated that are used to solve management, control, and decision-making tasks. To increase the efficiency of these procedures, it is proposed to use big data technologies. The basic steps of implementation of big data technology to solve the problems of process risk management are discussed.},

An evaluation of the evidence, however, suggests that team diversity does not reliably produce team creativity, and that the challenge for team creativity research and practice is to identify the moderating influences that allow teams to reap the benefits of diversity in their creative performance. We review the available evidence for the moderating influences on the relationship between team diversity and team creativity, and we conclude that the categorization-elaboration model (CEM) of team diversity and performance provides a useful framework to understand these moderating influences. We discuss how the CEM can both guide the further development of the study of team creativity and the integration of the study of diversity effects on team creativity and of cross-level effects on individual creativity.</p>},

One of those is autonomous driving (AD), which needs to be propped up by integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to improve user acceptance. Strong reliance of proposed solutions on communication and data management, as well as on a variety of complex and heterogeneous architectures and components exposes a range of vulnerabilities. The weaknesses are strongly correlated to dependability, which is crucial factor for success of AD. IoT4CPS, a flagship Austrian project, contributes to improvements in required dependability. It is developing guidelines, methods and tools for safe and secure integration of IoT into AD and corresponding smart production. The project addresses safety and security aspects of AD in a holistic manner. Some of the resulting considerations are described in this paper, alongside possible solutions based on virtualisation through usage of digital twins.},

  abstract       = {The need for clean energy for development and growth gave rise to power electronic interfaced local renewable generation and microgrids. Researchers across the world have been working on a spectrum of issues pertaining to the field of microgrids, ranging from control, operation and management aspects for the islanded, grid connected modes and the seamless transition aspects, to the protection and the power quality issues. These proposed solutions need rigorous testing under a wide range of dynamic conditions, before actual field deployment under diverse environments. Thus there needs to be a focus to develop fast, safe, accurate and reliable testing methods. Accuracy, flexibility, scalability, compactness, ease of implementation and economic viability are some of the common parameters which are used in the benchmarking of a testing methodology. These objectives are mostly in conflict with each other and thus need fresh out of the box solutions for the design and development of the testing methodologies. The chapter presents the fundamentals of and a comparison between the various testing techniques - ranging from off-line to real-time (RT) simulations, rapid controller prototyping, hardware in the loop (HIL): both the signal level (CHIL) and power level (PHIL), RT power level emulation, test-bed platforms, hybrid approaches/combinations of these techniques and novel solutions such as digital twin, blockchain and internet of things (IoT) based approaches. The future challenges in the area of microgrid testing are also discussed.},

  abstract       = {In a hybrid layout production system under uncertainties, making strategic decisions becomes crucial and demanding, with an increase in the complexity of the system. The advent of Industry 4.0 leads to the development of technologies such as smart factories, simulation, cloud, cyber-physical systems that use digital twins for making informed strategic decisions in a factory. This paper proposes a decision-making framework for a multi-product hybrid layout production system under stochastic disruptions using a simulation model. The simulation model will act as a digital twin of the physical system, which helps to proactively visualize and analyze several key performance parameters of the system and make informed decisions. The objective of this paper is to identify the best sequence from predefined sequences for jobs, which maximize profit, throughput, and minimize cost, and make-span. Several experimentation cases are developed to analyze the performance of the system under different scenarios of disruptions and make strategic decisions such as investing in new machines, prioritizing products, and rescheduling of products.},

  abstract       = {The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research. In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical, biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv) precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data, compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i) cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security and privacy schemes.},

In the manufacturing industry, value creation processes change as information and communication technologies merge with production processes. The change may enable efficiency gains and new business models. However, many firms still struggle to drive their digital transformation forward. To understand the barriers which hinder or even stop DT is essential for the successful transformation. Our study aims at identifying the barriers on the basis of 46 expert interviews. These practical insights are further used to develop a research agenda. To determine the research gaps, we conduct a literature review on the topics mentioned by the interviewees. Thus, we contribute by first of all identifying major barriers which can support firms by reflecting their DT. Moreover, we give an outlook for researchers on possible future exploration. So, we bring together perspectives from research and practice.},

  abstract       = {With rapid technology advancements and impacts of digital trans-formation technologies, there have been a lot of efforts in recent years at the global and national scope to develop technology eco-systems moving toward Industry 4.0. There has also been a growing number of studies about optimization of process parameters based on AI, IoT and Bigdata analytics, including CNC machining, additive manufacturing, as well as industrial welding with robots, for development of Smart Manufacturing (SM), which is one of the key elements of Industry 4.0. However, there are challenges to fully develop and apply in industrial practices the ideal SM models in the next 5 to 10 years. It is necessary to develop the cost-effective SM models that are easy to understand with a high level of applicability in practice and adoptability for SMEs. In this paper, a conceptual digital twin is proposed, with the focus on cost-effective design and development of a welding robotic system for smart manufacturing.},

  abstract       = {Today we live in a time where new technologies are developing rapidly. Digitalization and automation are finding their way into various industrial sectors, especially in the area of Industry 4.0. As in previous digitalization efforts in the manufacturing sector, it can be observed that the discourse is strongly concentrated on technological themes, neglecting the overall integration of technologies into the organization. In this paper, we conduct a literature review on the concept of a digital twin, i.e. a simulation-oriented closed loop system consisting of physical and digital components. We map the identified themes to the elements of a socio-technical system to show which issues in the discourse are underrepresented from a managerial point of view in order to provide indications for a more holistic discourse.},

In the context of the continuing digitalization of the manufacturing industry Digital Twins (DT) have emerged as a new kind of networked information system, which converges real-world assets with virtual counterparts. Smart service systems (SSS) provide a new perspective on these information systems enabling a connection between the technical concepts of industry 4.0 with service science. We conduct an action design research study in the machine manufacturing industry and use the SSS as a guiding perspective for our DT design. This paper contributes three design principles for DTs in manufacturing: (1) cyber-physical (re-) configurability, (2) smartness of the product, and (3) IT platform as a boundary object. The design was evaluated with several manufacturing companies based on a user interface prototype.},

The “convergence of Industrié 4.0 and Value Chain Network 2.0 and the “total focus upon stakeholder value (not solely on shareholder satisfaction) offers new perspectives on what, how, when, and where this is undertaken. Managing the business model implements the strategic intention by selecting the relevant capability response characteristics required to achieve the objectives set by management. In this chapter we review the significant components of the “convergence and how they impact on the capability responses. Capability characteristics play an important role in the operationalization of strategic capability responses. The availability of real-time data makes the concept of a “rolling value proposition possible by identifying changes in operating requirements and applying them digitally. Real-time data analysis can be used to monitor margin management and “translate the implications of change to short-term profitability throughout the network. Digital twinning provides data on operational efficiency; the data output can be used immediately to improve asset productivity and in the longer-term to make specification changes. Network partners are able to “connect with the data to modify their inputs into product-service performance in both short- and long-term performance. The data outputs can also revise work practices and be added to training and upgrading of staff skills. The aggregation of performance data identifies the efficiency of the producibility infrastructure and identifies requirements for changes in partner contributions and, possibly, value chain positioning. Monitoring the use of resources, both production assets and consumables, is leading to changes in operational practices that can conserve these resources and lead to long-term design changes that build in remanufacturing requirements into product-service packages.},

The approach being taken by IKEA to explore its strategic direction suggests a pensive what and why and when and how and where and who. Industry dynamics differs; it is searching for changes that will impact upon all organizations; it is for each of them to analyze and explore the implications of changes and shifts of emphasis in their definition of their business environment; it is for the organization to define their future business environment and the opportunities it offers. IKEA are clearly taking a very broad view of the opportunity space they are considering. In retrospect General Electric appears not to have taken such an approach. Observation of large automotive manufacturers suggests they have identified changes in ownership and use patterns of behavior, vehicle power sources, and whether or not there will be the need for a vehicle driver.},

  abstract       = {With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.},

For Industrie 4.0 to come true, it is essential to implement the horizontal integration of inter-corporation value network, the end-to-end integration of engineering value chain, and the vertical integration of factory inside. In this paper, we focus on the vertical integration to implement flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. We first propose a brief framework that incorporates industrial wireless networks, cloud, and fixed or mobile terminals with smart artifacts such as machines, products, and conveyors. Then, we elaborate the operational mechanism from the perspective of control engineering, that is, the smart artifacts form a self-organized system which is assisted with the feedback and coordination blocks that are implemented on the cloud and based on the big data analytics. In addition, we outline the main technical features and beneficial outcomes and present a detailed design scheme. We conclude that the smart factory of Industrie 4.0 is achievable by extensively applying the existing enabling technologies while actively coping with the technical challenges.},

  abstract       = {Many articles have been published on intelligent manufacturing, most of which focus on hardware, software, additive manufacturing, robotics, the Internet of Things, and Industry 4.0. This paper provides a different perspective by examining relevant challenges and providing examples of some less-talked-about yet essential topics, such as hybrid systems, redefining advanced manufacturing, basic building blocks of new manufacturing, ecosystem readiness, and technology scalability. The first major challenge is to (re-)define what the manufacturing of the future will be, if we wish to: ① raise public awareness of new manufacturing’s economic and societal impacts, and ② garner the unequivocal support of policy-makers. The second major challenge is to recognize that manufacturing in the future will consist of systems of hybrid systems of human and robotic operators; additive and subtractive processes; metal and composite materials; and cyber and physical systems. Therefore, studying the interfaces between constituencies and standards becomes important and essential. The third challenge is to develop a common framework in which the technology, manufacturing business case, and ecosystem readiness can be evaluated concurrently in order to shorten the time it takes for products to reach customers. Integral to this is having accepted measures of “scalability of non-information technologies. The last, but not least, challenge is to examine successful modalities of industry–academia–government collaborations through public–private partnerships. This article discusses these challenges in detail.},

  abstract    = {Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security, there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract       = {The application of intelligence to manufacturing has emerged as a compelling topic for researchers and industries around the world. However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keywords frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.},

We propose a deployment & control scheme of RFID sensors based on digital-twin technology. The constructed digital-twin model can simulate the state, the performance, and the activity of physical entities. In this paper, we predict and analyze based on digital-twin technology to solve the problems of re-design & re-deployment. We further achieve the goal of saving deployment time & workforce through the intuition and virtual simulation of digital-twin.

  abstract       = {With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.},

  abstract       = {Big data is one of the most important resources for the promotion of smart customisation. With access to data from multiple sources, manufacturers can provide on-demand and customised products. However, existing research of smart customisation has focused on data generated from the physical world, not virtual models. As physical data is constrained by what has already occurred, it is limited in the identification of new areas to improve customer satisfaction. A new technology called digital twin aims to achieve this integration of physical and virtual entities. Incorporation of digital twin into the paradigm of existing data-driven smart customisation will make the process more responsive, adaptable and predictive. This paper presents a new framework of data-driven smart customisation augmented by digital twin. The new framework aims to facilitate improved collaboration of all stakeholders in the customisation process. A case study of the elevator industry illustrates the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

  volume         = {72},
  abstract       = {This paper provides a review of research into using Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality(MR) for remote collaboration on physical tasks. AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. This work will be useful for current and future researchers who are interested in collaborative AR/MR systems.},

In view of the research and preliminary application of the digital twin in complex systems such as aerospace, we will have the opportunity to use the digital twin to solve the bottleneck of current battery research. Firstly, this paper arranges the development history, basic concepts and key technologies of the digital twin, and summarizes current research methods and challenges in battery modeling, state estimation, remaining useful life prediction, battery safety and control. Furthermore, based on digital twin we describe the solutions for battery digital modeling, real-time state estimation, dynamic charging control, dynamic thermal management, and dynamic equalization control in the intelligent battery management system. We also give development opportunities for digital twin in the battery field. Finally we summarize the development trends and challenges of smart battery management.},

  abstract       = {The digital twin is becoming the most promising emerging technology in the field of unmanned combat and has the potential to innovate future combat styles. Online battlefield learning is one of the key technologies for supporting the successful application of digital twin in unmanned combat. Since there is an urgent need for effective algorithms for online learning the battlefield states in real time, a new random finite set- (RFS-) based algorithm is proposed in the presence of detection uncertainty including clutters, missed detection, and noises. The system architecture and operational mode for implementing the digital twin-enabled online battlefield learning are provided. The unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is employed as the experimental subject for systematically describing the proposed algorithm. The system architecture for implementing the digital twin-enabled online battlefield learning is firstly given, and its operational mode is also described in detail. The RFS-based digital twin models including the battlefield state model, UGV motion model, and sensor model are designed. The Bayesian inference is adopted, and the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is modified to implement the online learning process. At last, a group of experiments are conducted to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The research work in this paper will provide a good demonstration of the application of digital twin in unmanned combat.},

  abstract       = {Surveillance, now a commonplace phenomenon in everyday life, has been explored from various disciplines over three decades. Today's surveillance practices depend primarily upon many software technologies that collect, store and process personal data for the purposes of influence, management, protection or detection. The identification and categorisation of data have thus emerged as the technical signature of surveillance. An individual has many identities belonging to different contexts of his/her life, but in this paper, we explore the relationship between surveillance and identity in virtual contexts only. We argue that an understanding of identity purely as data is fundamental to understanding surveillance. We propose abstract general definitions of surveillance and identity that together create a conceptual framework, capturing key features common to many disparate surveillance situations. Our work concludes that the essence of surveillance is that of a surveillance context, which is precisely and solely defined by the availability of data about the behaviour and identity of its entities. The data that distinguishes the entities of the context we call identifiers; we explore the creation, provenance, comparison and transformation of identifiers. Abstractly, surveillance is a process that tests for properties of data, and sorts identifiers into categories.},

This means the adaptation of a data-driven manufacturing model, which includes the horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain and the management of data across the whole product life cycle. Currently companies face two major problems in this transformation of their IT architectures: 1) There are multiple reference architectures for Industrie 4.0, whose suitability has not been evaluated in a straightforward way. 2) There are no maturity models to objectively assess data-driven IT architectures. In this work we address these problems by providing an overview of Industrie 4.0 features in multiple reference architectures and developing a maturity model for IT architectures for data-driven manufacturing. We first give an overview of the current maturity models with aspects of data-driven manufacturing. Based on this overview we survey three reference architectures for Industrie 4.0: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0, and the Stuttgart IT Architecture for Manufacturing. We analyze and assess each approach and define maturity levels for data-driven manufacturing to guide companies in the adaption process of Industrie 4.0, as well as criteria for meeting these levels.},

  abstract       = {Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance on decision-making tasks. Still, it is vulnerable to the backdoor attack because of lacking transparency, which results in unexpected results for the input with a trigger. Backdoors can remain hidden in neural networks for a long time, and the networks implanted with backdoors can still make correct judgments when receiving normal inputs. The most common way to implant backdoors into neural networks is to perform trigger inserting and label modifying in the training dataset so that the trained models naturally carry backdoors. This paper proposes a novel defense method against neural network backdoor attacks, referred to as the backdoor filter. The defense is deployed on the dataset used for model training: It first blurs the dataset images and then performs sharpening operations on the obtained processed intermediate parts. This processed dataset is then used as input to the neural network for model training. We use three different types of backdoor attacks to validate our approach, evaluating the prediction accuracy and the attack's success rate after our processing. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the success rate of the corresponding attacks and effectively defend against backdoor attacks.},

The sensing and controlling of these systems is the work of the highly distributed and connected electronic control units. To keep pace with the fast growing automotive market, reusability of components and features is today the key to reduce costs and time-to-market. Especially when systems are safety-critical and demand reliability, new methods and tools are thus essential to support the reusability aspect in the development process. A model-based approach, in conjunction, moreover helps to communicate between different stakeholders, provides different views and serves as a central storage of information. Through applying reliability analysis and simulation-based verification methods on our hardware model and furthermore automatic generation of a first virtual prototype, we are able to reduce the tools involved, thus resulting in correctness, completeness and consistency of the entire system.},

Yet, little research on web customization has hitherto shed light on the practice of advertisement (ad) customization and particularly ad quantity customization (AQC). To uncover the potential of AQC as a tool to foster user engagement, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment comprising 17,241 visits to a news website. Our findings reveal that users spend more time on the website and explore more pages when users can (vs. cannot) customize the quantity of ads. Most interestingly, users engage more with the website when given the possibility of AQC than when experiencing a website that is ad-free by default. Additionally, users respond particularly positively to AQC when using mobile (vs. stationary) devices. With our research, we contribute to literature on web customization and provide insightful guidance whether and how website providers can harness ad customization.},

  abstract       = {The value of data analytics is fundamental in cyber-physical production systems for tasks like optimization and predictive maintenance. The de facto standard for conducting data analytics in industrial applications is the CRISP-DM methodology. However, CRISP-DM does not specify a data acquisition phase within production scenarios. With this chapter, we present DMME as an extension to the CRISP-DM methodology specifically tailored for engineering applications. It provides a communication and planning foundation for data analytics within the manufacturing domain, including the design and evaluation of the infrastructure for process-integrated data acquisition. In addition, the methodology includes functions of design of experiments capabilities to systematically and efficiently identify relevant interactions. The procedure of DMME methodology is presented in detail and an example project illustrates the workflow. This case study was part of a collaborative project with an industrial partner who wanted an application to detect marginal lubrication in linear guideways of a servo-driven axle based only on data from the drive controller. Decision trees detect the lubrication state, which are trained with experimental data. Several experiments, taking the lubrication state, velocity, and load on the slide into account, provide the training and test datasets.},

There is a plethora of methods and assessment frameworks, here we introduce the OMiLAB Innovation Corner that assists in (1) creating new business, (2) design the organisational model and (3) engineer proof-of-concept prototypes as a “communication media. The unique value proposition of OMiLAB Innovation Corner is the model-based foundation that supports decision makers in key phases of the innovation. First, the creation of new business models by providing digital design thinking tools is assisted. Second, the design of the digital organisation by providing extended modelling capabilities is supported. Third, a proof-of-concept engineering providing robots and sensors is enabled. We share our practical exeriences by introducing (a) how new business models are created in the H2020 project Change2Twin to help manufacturing SMEs in their digital transformation, (b) how conceptual models are design in the H2020 project BIMERR to create digital twins of renovation processes and (d) how proof-of-concept engineering is performed in the FFG project complAI to analyse different robotic behaviour.},

Noch nie gab es so viele unterschiedliche, miteinander kombierbare Technologien und damit ein so schwer zu durchschauendes, branchenumwälzendes Feld wie heute. Für die Chefetage birgt diese rasch voranschreitende Entwicklung von Technologien Chancen und Risiken zugleich. Als Business Technologies verstandene Technologien werden zum sicheren Wachstumsmotor, wenn sie bei richtigem Einsatz Effizienzreserven ausschöpfen, Unternehmen zum besseren „Kundenversteher“ befähigen und Innovationen ermöglichen. Sie werden zur Bedrohung, wenn sie sich in der eigenen Branche schneller als erwartet ausbreiten und den Wettbewerbs- und Anpassungsdruck erhöhen. Im Transformationskontext sprechen wir insbesondere von 20 Zukunftstechnologien, bei denen eine als Supertechnologie im Zentrum vor allen anderen steht: Künstliche Intelligenz. Die universell integrierbare Supertechnologie kann jede andere Technologie in ihrer Leistungsfähgikeit verbessern und ökonomisch veredeln. Damit wird KI zum größten Effizienz- und Innovationstreiber des digitalen Zeitalters. Im hier vorgestellten Technologierad der nächsten Generation werden alle 20 Technologien in einem Modell zusammengeführt. Aufgeteilt in Basis-, Schlüssel- und Schrittmachertechnologien umspannen sie einen ganzheitlich aufgefächerten Bezugsrahmen, der Unternehmen zur Verfügung steht, um eine robuste und zukunftsfähige Marktsituation zu entwickeln. Wenden Unternehmen KI und weitere Technologien richtig an, sind sie dem Wettbewerb weit voraus, begeistern ihre Kunden, steigern ihren Unternehmenwert und ihre Profitabilität und können kontinuierlich in weitere Technologien, Wettbewerbsvorteile und Innovationen investieren.},

  abstract       = {Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries, weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical operations and virtual space. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal, especially the allocation of dangerous goods and special cargo. Load planners can master complex air cargo load planning through the system with optimal solutions generated. The operations of cargo assembly and security screening with digital twins could be further developed for future development.},

Recently, the Digital Twin concept was launched as a tool for improving geometrical quality and reduce costs by using real time control and optimization of products and production systems. The Digital Twin for geometry assurance is created together with the product and the production systems in early design phases. When full production starts, the purpose of the Digital Twin turns towards optimization of the geometrical quality by small changes in the assembly process. To reach its full potential, the Digital Twin concept is depending on high quality input data. In line with Internet of Things and Big Data, the problem is rather to extract appropriate data than to find data. In this paper, an inspection strategy serving the Digital Twin is given. Necessary input data describing form and shape of individual parts, and how this data should be collected, stored and utilized is described.},

This paper presents a survey among researchers and engineers with expertise in variation management confirming the interest of digital twins in this area. The survey shows, however, a gap between future research interest in academia and industry, identifying a larger need in industry. This indicates that there are some barriers in the industry to overcome before the benefits of a digital twin for variation management and geometry assurance can be fully capitalized on in an industrial context. To identify those barriers and challenges, an extensive interview study with engineers from eight different companies in the manufacturing sectors was accomplished. The analysis identifies industrial challenges in the areas of system-level, simulation working process, management issues, and education. One of the main challenges is to keep the 3D models fully updated, including keeping track of changes during the product development process and also feedback changes during full production to the development engineers. This is a part of what is called the digital thread, which is also addressed in this paper.},

  abstract       = {Over the past few decades, both small- and medium-sized manufacturers as well as large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been faced with an increasing need for low cost and scalable intelligent manufacturing machines. Capabilities are needed for collecting and processing large volumes of real-time data generated from manufacturing machines and processes as well as for diagnosing the root cause of identified defects, predicting their progression, and forecasting maintenance actions proactively to minimize unexpected machine down times. Although cloud computing enables ubiquitous and instant remote access to scalable information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures and high volume data storage, it has limitations in latency-sensitive applications such as high performance computing and real-time stream analytics. The emergence of fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent radical changes in the way sensing systems, along with ICT infrastructures, collect and analyze large volumes of real-time data streams in geographically distributed environments. Ultimately, such technological approaches enable machines to function as an agent that is capable of intelligent behaviors such as automatic fault and failure detection, self-diagnosis, and preventative maintenance scheduling. The objective of this research is to introduce a fog-enabled architecture that consists of smart sensor networks, communication protocols, parallel machine learning software, and private and public clouds. The fog-enabled architecture will have the potential to enable large-scale, geographically distributed online machine and process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis that require low latency and high bandwidth in the context of data-driven cyber-manufacturing systems.},

The application of CPSs in production and manufacturing environments gave rise to the term Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). There is a growing interest in CPPSs, yet research in this area is scattered and needs to be reviewed for understanding their development status and maturity. The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze the current research activities on CPPSs according to their contributions to the engineering life cycle of such production system. Firstly, a method for SLR is presented. Then, literature analysis of CPPSs is conducted to present research activities in the light of the concept development and engineering development stages. Finally, based on the results of the literature analysis, a concept map of CPPSs research is proposed, which depicts the existing research topics in the engineering life cycle of CPPSs. And we exploit it to propose a research agenda of the CPPSs integration process required to ensure their efficient industrial use. Findings of this review can help researchers to examine the maturity of the development status of CPPSs, to discover which phases require improvement, and to know the future research directions for their industrial practices.},

The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.},

  abstract       = {Increased outsourcing of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and fabrication combined with malicious hardware security threats such as contactless optical probing have greatly decreased an attacker’s difficulty in reverse engineering or maliciously modifying a given circuit. This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample’s ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.},

This work proposes a data-driven approach to utilize digital transformation methods to automate smart manufacturing systems. This is fundamentally enabled by using a digital twin to represent manufacturing cells, simulate system behaviors, predict process faults, and adaptively control manipulated variables. First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a network of interfaces between the environments is designed and implemented to enable communication between the digital world and physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel combination between data science and manufacturing industries.},

Contemporary definitions and examples of digital twins have covered company- or product-specific solutions or discussed the use of digital twins in rather proprietary value chains. This paper addresses the importance of taking an ecosystem view on software development on digital twins for industry 4.0 and outlines a framework for building a research agenda for such ecosystems. The framework includes three dimensions: scope of the digital twin software platform (internal, value chain, ecosystem), life-cycle phases of the industry 4.0 system related with the digital twin (creation, production, operation & maintenance, disposal), and level of integration between the twin and the physical system (model, shadow, twin). As this research-in-progress addresses examples of research questions in light of the framework, further research to build a full-scale research agenda based on a systematic literature review is suggested.},

  abstract       = {Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) serves as an interdisciplinary effort that incorporates cyber vector as well as physical vector. The latter can generate exponentially growing amounts of data. How to process CPS big data systematically and efficiently is the key to the breakthrough of offering prospective and personalized services for each individual user and entity involved. In recent years, much research has been proactively conducted on advancing specific scenario or algorithm. However, few surveys value their integration. For good measure, the synthesis remains a fundamental challenge. Subsequently, we fill the gap in the literature by constructing cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing as a whole to inspire on new architectures and cross utilizations. Moreover, bringing the enthusiasm of traditionally solitude entities into play is crucial. In this exploratory study, we examine definitions of CPS as well as the three aforementioned computing paradigms and then shed new light on comprehensively established frameworks. We also survey on the application level of Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing in CPS respectively and dive into diversified algorithms and strategies to embed big data applications into a more intelligent and convenient society with current deficiencies and future research directions followed.},

  abstract       = {Autonomous vehicles(AVs) have developed rapidly in recent years and derived many AV-related services. However, the stringent requirement of real-time sensing, computing, and communication may severely overload the AV, resulting in a poor passenger experience. In this work, we leverage the digital twin(DT) concept to help the information fusion and computing for AV, propose a vehicular digital twin(VDT) framework. Specifically, DT is maintained in the cloud and synchronized with its corresponding AV in real-time. AV uploads necessary information to the DT, and DT makes feedback through processing and analysis. The DT can also communicate with other DTs to obtain information. Due to the real-time information synchronization of AV and DT in an open communication environment, ensuring communication security and protect privacy is needed. To tackle those issues, we give a concrete authentication protocol for secure communication between AV and DT. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed protocol not only has less computation cost but also can satisfy the necessary security requirements.},

At the ten-year mark of the introduction of Industry 4.0, the European Commission announced Industry 5.0. Industry 4.0 is considered to be technology-driven, whereas Industry 5.0 is value-driven. The co-existence of two Industrial Revolutions invites questions and hence demands discussions and clarifications. We have elected to use five of these questions to structure our arguments and tried to be unbiased for the selection of the sources of information and for the discussions around the key issues.

  abstract       = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a dangerous network attack method that is widely used by attackers nowadays. During the APT attack process, attackers often use advanced techniques and tools, thus, causing many difficulties for information security systems. In fact, to detect the APT attacks, intrusion detection systems cannot rely on one technique or method but often combine multiple techniques and methods. In addition, the approach for APT attack detection using behavior analysis and evaluation techniques is facing many difficulties due to the lack of characteristic data of attack campaigns. For the above reasons, in this paper, we propose a method for APT attack detection based on a multi-layer analysis. The multi-layer analysis technique in our proposal computes and analyzes various events in Network Traffic to detect and synthesize abnormal signs and behaviors in order to make conclusions about the existence of APT in the system. Specifically, in our proposal, we will use serial 3 main layers for the APT attack detection process including i) Detecting APT attacks based on analyzing abnormal connection; ii) Detecting APT attacks based on analyzing and evaluating Suricata log; iii) Detecting APT attacks based on analyzing behavior profiles that are compiled from layers (i) and (ii). To achieve these goals, the multi-layer analysis technique for APT attack detection will perform 2 main tasks: i) Analyzing and evaluating components of Network Traffic based on abnormal signs and behaviors. ii) building and classifying behavior profile based on each component of network traffic. In the experimental section, we will compare and evaluate the effectiveness of the APT attack detection process of each layer in the multi-layer analysis model using machine learning. Experimental results have shown that the APT attack detection method based on analyzing behavior profile has yielded better results than individual detection methods on all metrics. The research results shown in the paper not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the multilayer analysis model for APT attack detection but also provide a novel approach for detecting several other cyber-attack techniques.},

  abstract       = {Recent outbreaks of food contamination scandals in India have resulted in increased concerns amongst consumers about food safety. Further, to tackle such circumstances, conformation to quality has become a must in Agriculture Supply Chain (ASC). Agro-stakeholders have tried to accomplish this demand through the integration of technology in ASC. One such technology is blockchain, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India. Fueled by this motivation, we aim to investigate the significant barriers for blockchain adoption in Indian ASC. The constructs are identified through a comprehensive literature search and opinion of domain experts from five agro-organizations, academia, and agro-stakeholders. Further identified construct is modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL approach, which not only interrogates interrelationship amongst identified constructs but also evaluates the intensity of the relationship between them. The identified constructs are also clustered into a suitable group using Fuzzy-MICMAC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. The results reveal that “lack of government regulation and lack of trust among agro-stakeholder to use blockchain are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Indian ASC. Moreover, the managerial implication about the results is also provided, which will be useful to government and related agencies to take suitable measures to overcome these obstacles for increasing the rate of blockchain adoption in Indian ASC.},

We analyzed the additional benefits that economic actors can gain from using the DO. This object is fairly well-understood from a technical point of view; although there are many options for its definition, its basic composition and functionality are defined clearly, but currently in the economic science DO has not yet been enough considered. The DO, which first appeared as a digital twin has not been properly explored by economic science. The ontological analysis of the DO within the existing conceptual framework of economic science are presented. The DO is comprehensively examined to determine whether all the properties and characteristics of the DO are described by modern economic language or whether there is a need to introduce new concepts and categories to describe such objects. We propose to analyze the DO in terms of such economic categories as goods, innovation process, the system of division of labor, the role of market participants in the creation and use of the DO, intellectual property, etc.},

Our literature survey pinpoints that systems scalability, interoperability, information security, and data quality domains are among those where many challenges occur. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a new breed of technology characterized by decentralized verifiability, transparency, data privacy, integrity, high availability, and data protection properties. Although many researchers leveraged BCT to empower various aspects of industrial manufacturing systems, there is no study dedicated to addressing the challenges impacting the manufacturing systems compliant with the ISA95 standard. Thereby, our study aims to fill the identified research gap systematically. This paper thoroughly analyzes the challenges hampering the ISA95-CTS and SMMS and methodically addresses them with corresponding BCT capabilities. Furthermore, this paper also discusses various aspects, including the weaknesses, of BCT convergence to ISA95-CTS and SMMS.},

Smart devices are inherently vulnerable to cyber attacks, that’s why we are observing an increase in crimes related to cyber space comparing to physical space. To address these crimes, police of the future need to evolve as well and data will be at the center stage of this evolution.

Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index. The evaluation model of machine tool is solved by Reference Ideal Method (RIM). Finally, the proposed decision-making approach for DMTS is tested in an aviation plant.},

A comprehensive review of the literature regarding the application of blockchain in the construction domain found that there are few studies and applications of blockchain in construction practices, and most of the current research involves qualitative studies only. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of applying both public blockchain and private blockchain technologies in the construction industry using two industry cases. Two business process cases (i.e., Case 1 and Case 2) were selected and used to drive the blockchain-based software system architecture design. The proposed architectures were demonstrated using Hyperledger Fabric (a private, permissioned and open source blockchain platform) and Ethereum (a public blockchain platform) respectively, to reflect the different requirements of the two use cases. This pilot study also illustrates the process, benefits, and challenges of adopting private and public blockchain technologies in construction domain. This research provides insights to researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption of blockchain technology, especially in construction industry.},

  abstract       = {SUMMARY An intelligent battery management system is a crucial enabler for energy storage systems with high power output, increased safety and long lifetimes. With recent developments in cloud computing and the proliferation of big data, machine learning approaches have begun to deliver invaluable insights, which drives adaptive control of battery management systems (BMS) with improved performance. In this paper, a general framework utilizing an end-edge-cloud architecture for a cloud-based BMS is proposed, with the composition and function of each link described. Cloud-based BMS leverages from the Cyber Hierarchy and Interactional Network (CHAIN) framework to provide multi-scale insights, more advanced and efficient algorithms can be used to realize the state-of-X estimation, thermal management, cell balancing, fault diagnosis and other functions of traditional BMS system. The battery intelligent monitoring and management platform can visually present battery performance, store working-data to help in-depth understanding of the microscopic evolutionary law, and provide support for the development of control strategies. Currently, the cloud-based BMS requires more effects on the multi-scale integrated modeling methods and remote upgrading capability of the controller, these two aspects are very important for the precise management and online upgrade of the system. The utility of this approach is highlighted not only for automotive applications, but for any battery energy storage system, providing a holistic framework for future intelligent and connected battery management.},

  abstract       = {Secure semantic searching provides privacy-preserving information retrieval for arbitrary queries semantically related to keywords. However, current verification mechanisms cannot verify the correctness of search results for semantically related queries in mutual distrust scenarios. Moreover, most secure semantic searching schemes still perform exact matching on ciphertext after query expansion, then directly accumulate the weights of the matched keywords as similarity measurements to rank the documents, resulting in the search results with unsatisfied ranking. In this paper, we propose a secure heuristic semantic searching scheme, in which a privacy-preserving word nonlinear matching (PPWNM) method is developed, and a blockchain-based verification is designed to obtain trustworthy search results with high retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we describe several retrieval heuristics and formulate them as a word nonlinear matching problem, then transform it to the PPWNM problem for calculating the similarity measurement between the query and document so that the highly accurate ranked results can be obtained. Also we design a blockchain-based verification mechanism in which the blockchain nodes utilize the proofs generated during the matching process to verify the correctness of the search results and reach a consensus to ensure the trustworthy results and fair payment between the participants in a mutual distrust model. Our security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is secure and has higher accuracy compared with the existing other schemes.},

  abstract       = {The vigorous development of the Industrial Internet of Things brings the advanced connection function of the new generation of industrial automation and control systems. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network is converted into an open and highly interconnected network, where the equipment connections between industrial electronic devices are integrated with a SCADA system through a Modbus protocol. As SCADA and Modbus are easily used for control and monitoring, the interconnection and operational efficiency between systems are highly improved; however, such connectivity inevitably exposes the system to the open network environment. There are many network security threats and vulnerabilities in a SCADA network system. Especially in the era of the Industrial Internet of Things, any security vulnerability of an industrial system may cause serious property losses. Therefore, this paper proposes an encryption and verification mechanism based on the trusted token authentication service and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to prevent attackers from physical attacks. Experimentally, this paper deployed and verified the system in an actual field of energy management system. According to the experimental results, the security defense architecture proposed in this paper can effectively improve security and is compatible with the actual field system.},

  abstract       = {Urban sensors are an important part of urban infrastructures and are usually heterogeneous. Urban sensors with different uses vary greatly in hardware structure, communication protocols, data formats, interaction modes, sampling frequencies, data accuracy and service quality, thus posing an enormous challenge to the unified integration and sharing of massive sensor information resources. Consequently, access and data management methods for these multisource heterogeneous urban sensors are extremely important. Additionally, multisource heterogeneous urban sensor access and data management technologies provide strong support for intelligent perception and scientific management at the city scale and can accelerate the construction of smart cities or digital twin cities with virtual reality features. We systematically summarize the related research on these technologies. First, we present a summary of the concepts and applications of urban sensors. Then, the research progress on multisource heterogeneous urban sensor access technologies is analysed in relation to communication protocols, data transmission formats, access standards, access technologies and data transmission technologies. Subsequently, the data management technologies for urban sensors are reviewed from the perspectives of data cleaning, data compression, data storage, data indexing and data querying. In addition, the challenges faced by the technologies above and corresponding feasible solutions are discussed from three aspects, namely, the integration of massive Internet of Things (IoT), computational burden and energy consumption and cybersecurity. Finally, a summary of this paper is given, and possible future development directions are analysed and discussed.},

  abstract       = {Internet of Drones (IoDs) is getting growing interest of researchers due to its applicability in wide range of applications for transportation, weather monitoring, emergency monitoring for flood, earth quake, healthcare and road hazards. To update the data about emergency situation, a real-time data sharing is mandatory. However, regular message transmission by various drones may not only overwhelm a central server but it also causes congestion on the network. It is mandatory to reduce messaging cost and congestion. This paper presents a fog-assisted congestion avoidance approach for Smooth Message Dissemination (SMD). We present a message forwarding algorithm for congestion avoidance to select the appropriate next-hop node using layered model. This model is based on various layers having drones. In first phase, it looks for an appropriate drone in a layer near the fog server for message forwarding. In next step, the drone is identified in nearby layers to forward the emergency message to next-hop to further locate the group head as per priority. It is a drone that has less distance towards fog server and inform in its one-hop circle. It can stop forwarding message after delivering it to fog server. Finally, the fog server disseminates information timely towards upper layers for necessary actions for emergency situations. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations using NS 2.35. Results prove the dominance of SMD over counterparts in terms of messaging overhead, packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption and average delay. Proposed SMD improves PDR by 85% and message overhead cost by 91% as compared to counterparts.},

However, it is seen that everyone does not understand the concept of Industry 4.0 in a similar manner. For instance, Germany, where the concept was first introduced, is one of the technologically advanced and oldest countries, while labor is abundant and cheap in China, which is the most populous country in the world. On the other hand, Turkey is a developing country that is technologically dependent on center countries and has an import-intense manufacturing structure. Due to the potential changes in productivity level and flexibility capability of companies that Industry 4.0 technologies can enable in manufacturing industries, strategies followed by companies from different countries and industrial contexts should be different and be customized to local conditions, but these differences were not considered in many recent studies in the related literature. As it is understood, there is a need for scientific studies based on real practices of Industry 4.0. In this context, this study aims to explore the current practices of two Turkish white goods manufacturing companies through a case study. The first company offers products and services around the world and the second company is the supplier of the first one.},

  abstract       = {In this paper, we investigate the secure vehicle communications in cybertwin-enabled integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, where the digital twins (DTs) in the cybertwin space reflects the physical entities (i.e., satellite, terrestrial base station (BS), and vehicles). Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links, it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.},

  abstract       = {Cyber-physical power systems (CPPS) are interconnected architectures that interact with the physical power system environment by utilizing communication, control, and computing resources. Enterprise, industries, and critical infrastructure rely on CPPS. As a result of their critical importance, they are prime targets for cyberattacks aimed at disrupting their operations. CPPS are mission-critical, attacks on them can have disastrous consequences. CPPS security can be improved by utilizing testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover threats, develop sustainable cybersecurity solutions, and evaluate grid operation in physical fault-induced or cyberattack scenarios. This Part-II paper reviews the CPPS testbeds in the view of the testbed type, targeted research area, CPPS domain, and communication infrastructure with the fusion of physical and cyber systems. Furthermore, this review gives an outline, framework, and application-based assessment of various industry and institutional testbeds. The design process of CPPS testbeds is reviewed first in this paper(Part-II), followed by description of the classification of CPPS testbeds for cyberattacks and sustainable cybersecurity analysis in CPPS. A brief overview of CPPS testbeds in various academic institutions, R&D laboratories, and industries are provided and each testbed is evaluated using the eleven proposed assessment criteria. Finally, the current issues and future research directions for CPPS testbeds to develop a secure and sustainable electric power grid are discussed. The Part-I paper reviewed the major research areas in CPPS, the importance of cyberattack testbeds, and long-term cybersecurity analysis in CPPS, as well as the NIST framework for CPS, CPPS domains and research areas.},

  abstract       = {The Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS) is a new type of system in which the traditional energy system is integrated into the information network with control systems, communication networks, and computational units. CPPS is the foundation of a long-term transformation of energy management that will fundamentally alter the perspective and application pattern of traditional energy research. The strong interactions between systems in a CPPS introduce new challenges in maintaining high supply security, as new factors can affect the overall security of the power system. Such factors include cybersecurity, the behaviour and constraints of neighbouring energy systems, and the dynamics of interactions between the various systems. Integrating computing, communications, and control at all levels of electrical energy generation, transmission, distribution, utilisation, and storage in CPPS increases vulnerabilities and complicates security. Security studies must reflect the characteristics of the CPPS infrastructure in actual testing environments that support the interfacing of real-world hardware devices. CPPS testbeds are effective in this context because they provide testing capabilities for evaluating the synergistic relationship between physical and virtual components in controlled environments. Security-oriented CPPS testbeds are invaluable for performing cybersecurity and cyberattack analyses, identifying system threats and vulnerabilities in various layers of CPPS, implementing intrusion detection and prevention algorithms, and evaluating the efficacy of mitigation techniques without imposing excessive economic burdens or posing safety risks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CPPS testbeds from the standpoint of the physical power system layer, cyber system layer, and cyber-physical fusion layer. Following a brief description of the importance of testbeds for cybersecurity research in CPPS, and a brief classification of existing CPPS testbeds for cyberattacks, and cybersecurity analysis in CPPS is presented. A detailed overview of the outlook for future CPPS testbeds in terms of communication, control, computing, and educational perspective is provided. Finally, the work is concluded with future research directions for developing a secure electric power grid.},

  abstract       = {The integration of advanced Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the conventional electric power grid is evolving into a Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS). The seamless integration of control, communication, and computing operations allow CPPS to be fully monitored and controlled. Threats, vulnerabilities, and catastrophic attacks will intrude as CPPS monitoring, protection, and control functions advance. For the CPPS to operate safely, securely, and efficiently, sustainable cybersecurity solutions must be developed, and the power grid's reliability and resilience must be maintained even when exposed to unfavorable network conditions. While more distributed and renewable energy sources are connected to the grid, cybersecurity helps to ensure the supply of electricity is sustainable and of high quality. The validation of such sustainable cybersecurity analysis goes beyond the traditional power grid network analysis, which means that the test should integrate the physical and cyber system behavior and respond to the network attacks. To analyze the cybersecurity and cyberattacks in the practical CPPS, comprehensive and realistic CPPS testbeds are needed. The heterogeneous nature of the CPPS concept urges multidisciplinary testbeds with various functions and capabilities to evaluate the new cyber-attacks, vulnerabilities, and threats in CPPS. Using this CPPS testbed framework, the different types of cyber-attack can be detected, and detection algorithm can be evaluated, and helps to enhance the development of sustainable cybersecurity defenses for realistic CPPS environment with the increasingly dense integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). This Part-I paper review the CPPS testbeds in the view of the physical power system layer, sensing layer, communication layer, control layer, application layer, test platforms, and research goals with the fusion of cyber and physical systems. In addition, this review presented an overview, structure, and application-based evaluation of existing testbeds from the industry and institutions. The various research areas in CPPS are reviewed first to show the research trends on different aspects of CPPS which have gained significant attention in the past decade. The necessity of testbeds for cyberattacks and sustainable cybersecurity analysis in CPPS are then described. Finally, the NIST framework for CPS, CPPS domains, and research areas are presented. Further the Part-II paper will review the classification, overview, and assessment of CPPS testbeds.},

  abstract       = {Sharing Economy promotes Shared Manufacturing (SharedMfg) that allows self-organized individuals to get involved in manufacturing activities through peer-to-peer (P2P) collaborations. It extends the scope and depth of resources sharing and enables society-based manufacturing integration. SharedMfg is complex and is still in its infancy. It demands encouraging research to clarify the concept and understand the key operations. In this paper, the SharedMfg is analysed along with two significant manufacturing evolutional trends, (i.e., Servitization and Industry 4.0). Based on this, to reduce the complexities in operations, the concept and definition of SharedMfg are presented on the basis of a service hierarchy that includes Product-Service System, Configuration-Service System and Resource-Service System. At the same time, this paper looks SharedMfg as an independent socialization manufacturing mode (e.g. compared with Cloud Manufacturing), and also, the benefit in contributing to the integration of the manufacturing and service sectors is revealed. However, apart from the complexity, high-degree dynamics and uncertainties related to service operations challenge the application of SharedMfg as well. To meet both requirements, based on the construction of a three-dimensional SharedMfg Service (SMS) modelling framework, a hybrid integration and interoperable SharedMfg architecture is proposed to ensure the provision of SMS in efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, a dynamic SMS scheduling method in support of the technologies of Complex Network Analysis is presented. A case study associated with the networked fabrication of an assistive glove is applied by implementing a prototype system to validate the proposed frameworks and methods. Finally, an experiment for evaluating the efficiency of service matching is carried out to prove the SharedMfg that can provide better performance than Cloud Manufacturing and Social Manufacturing.},

  abstract       = {Blockchains can be used to enable new kinds of organizations, especially Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). In DAO, governance rules and transaction processing provided by traditional centralized authorities to support intermediation are completely replaced by the automated execution of trusted smart contracts to realize secure and immutable transactions. However, DAO may not be suitable for many business cases. Nevertheless, blockchains provide many unique functions, such as immutability, security, trust, and traceability, so that they can be used to augment existing software solutions. We introduce the concept of Blockchain-Augmented Organizations (BAO), in which traditional, Non-Blockchain Organizations (NBO) are augmented by the blockchain-based organizations. We compare BAO with DAO and NBO, and propose a model-based, process-driven engineering approach for constructing blockchain organizations and applications. Experience gained on a pilot blockchain prototyping experiment on an aerospace Model-Based Systems Engineering project using Hyperledger’s Fabric is used to elaborate and exemplify the paper.},

While Industry 4.0 is having several fundamental technology additive manufacturing has been playing an important role and takes part in today’s Industry 4.0 technology, prominently for automotive vehicle producers. Additive manufacturing has many advantages and tasks such as in reverse engineering, by defect prediction or producing complex shaped parts. Its vitality becomes more important when its implementation is combined with the most recent measurement technology ‘Computer Tomography’. CT can detect complex surfaces or inner structure with X-Ray usage which helps to additive manufacturing parts by inspection which can not be provided by a CMM in similar manner. That study presents a simple sample for the combination of these two technologies. Followingly, voids and GPS analyses after CT measurements of several parts will be introduced. Also, those CT inspections will give an example for a definite stage of Industry 4.0. In conclusion, a brief investigation of those innovative most recent technologies, which are developing in a continuous manner, will be made in the context of Industry 4.0 according to inspection results.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is characterized by increased flexibility of production processes, a level of customization, a level of automation, smart manufacturing execution, and overall optimized production processes. Despite global competition, flexibility is a differentiation strategy applied by manufacturers to remain competitive. By incorporating flexibility in the manufacturing process of their products, enterprises can adapt faster to the demands. Enterprises need cost-effective, intuitive solutions to benefit from Industry 4.0 involving minimal efforts and integration costs. This study presents a new approach increasing the flexibility of manufacturing operations including robot trajectory, processing, and quality control. The results are tested in an industrial platform 4.0 installed in the laboratory. Our approach is to transform a rigid production system into an agile production system. For this, we break down the manufacturing process and reorganize it by programming core modules while maintaining the existing control structure but upgrading its programmable function to the Manufacturing Execution System Layer. Thus, the production manager can use the developed modules connected by flows to orchestrate a new production plan in a short time compared with the traditional approach.},

Digitalization has brought all the urgency of information security problems, which depend on the efficiency of modern production on targeted and random destructive impact, which lead to hidden, remote, and difficult to detect effects that can cause catastrophic consequences. The information security problems of cyber-physical systems require the development of a new security methodology. In this paper, it is proposed to interpret the security of cyber-physical systems as the preservation of the sustainable functioning of the cyber-physical system in the context of a targeted destructive impact on its information components. Cybersecurity methodology extends the objects of protection from data or key information to control systems as telecommunications equipment and actuators in the energy and manufacturing. This paper describes the process of transition from access control to cyber-defense for securing cyber-physical systems.},

  year  = {2021},
  abstract       = {As digitization takes hold in all areas, collaboration within supply chains (SC) is also being disruptively changed. Data exchange in SC is increasing, and data-centric col-laborations emerge. Hand in hand new knowledge risks within the SC partnerships arise, due to the possibility of knowledge reengineering out of comprehensive datasets. This paper aims to focus on identifying challenges that pose knowledge risks and pos-sible actions to overcome them. Particularly, the focus is on knowledge risks emerging out of an organizational and technical perspective. These risks can also act as a barrier for technology adaption in industry, hence it is important to provide an overview of existing research, synthesize it with one another, and translate it to unexplored gaps. Therefore, a structured literature review is conducted. It is found that challenges are often related to topics of data security, data analytics, training, and trustful relation-ships. Furthermore, possible knowledge protection actions are shown.},

  abstract       = {The exploration of the general antecedents of what would cause users to adopt innovative information technologies in land sectors is critical for digital transformation in terms of governance. This empirical study employs a push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework (a paradigm that originated from the human migration theory), to examine why users would switch from the traditional paper-based work pattern to land information system (LIS) applications. Based upon the relevant technology adoption theories, a couple of determinants have been integrated into the PPM framework. The land sectors undergoing digital transformation in China have been chosen for such analysis and investigation. Data collected from 208 public servants at administrative county level in China are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses, using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The results show that push factors (such as dissatisfaction with traditional work patterns), and pulling factors (such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norms) positively affect switching intention. Meanwhile, mooring factors such as inertia hinder switching behavior. Based on these findings, several behavior interventions and land information usage policy suggestions are put forward to promote the digital transformation in land sectors.},

To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.},

However, most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then, hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive throughput and latency performance.},

  volume         = {58},
  abstract       = {For dynamic scheduling, which is daily decision-making in a job-shop, machine availability prediction, disturbance detection and performance evaluation are always common bottlenecks. Previous research efforts on addressing the bottlenecks primarily emphasize on the analysis of data from the physical job-shop, but with little connection and convergence with its virtual models and simulated data. By introducing digital twin (DT), further convergence between physical and virtual spaces of the job-shop can be achieved, which greatly enables dynamic scheduling. DT fuses both real and simulated data to provide more information for the prediction of machine availability on one hand; and on the other hand, it helps to detect disturbances through comparing the physical machine with its continuously updated digital counterpart in real time, triggering timely rescheduling when needed. It also enables comprehensive performance evaluation for rescheduling using multiple-dimension models, which can describe geometric properties, physics parameters and behaviors of the machines. In the paper, a five-dimension DT for a machine in the job-shop is introduced first, then the DT-based machine availability prediction, disturbance detection and performance evaluation methods are explored. Based on this, a DT-enhanced dynamic scheduling methodology is proposed. A scheduling process of making hydraulic valves in a machining job-shop is taken as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

In this study, we propose a social evolution modeling approach and construct a deduction model for self-playing, self-learning, and self-upgrading on the basis of the idea of parallel data and reinforcement learning. The proposed approach can evaluate the impact of an event, deduce the situation, and provide optimal strategies for decision-making. Taking the breakage of a submarine cable caused by earthquake as an example, we find that the proposed modeling approach can obtain a higher reward compared with other existing methods.},

In the existing literature, scholars focus on a local dot, such as: technology, function, elements and application based on IIP. However, there is a lack of an overall framework to study the top-level planning of IIP implementation from a systematic perspective. Moreover, there are few studies on the detailed path and steps of IIP implementation in a specific industry. The research objective is to study the general model, reference architecture, service evaluation index system, implementation path, application verification, etc. for IIP which meets the needs of industry on the basis of existing theory and industrial practice, and to provide reference for government and industry planning, design, implementation and promotion of IIP. From a case study, the comprehensive performance rate of comprehensive ability for IIP in a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry enterprise is calculated. It can reflect the comprehensive ability for IIP in enterprise from the ability of the IIP’s resource management, platform technology, industrial application, and etc. In addition, the general model, reference architecture, implementation path and service evaluation system of IIP can improve the enterprise's resource management ability, platform service ability, industrial application ability, and enhance the core value of the enterprise and increase benefits.},

  abstract       = {The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has seen a continuous growth in the application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) over the last two decades while building automation and robotics is also gaining ground in the meantime. With more joint applications of both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing, assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally, a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are discussed to provide guidelines for future applications.},

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL) approaches, the application of AI-enabled methods to monitor, diagnose and predict potential equipment malfunctions has gone through tremendous progress with verified success in both academia and industry. However, there is still a gap to cover monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis based on AI-enabled methods, simultaneously, and the importance of an open source community, including open source datasets and codes, has not been fully emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper provides a systematic overview of the current development, common technologies, open source datasets, codes, and challenges of AI-enabled PHM methods from three aspects of monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis.},

The widespread application of CPS in manufacturing environments renders manufacturing systems increasingly smart. To advance research on the implementation of Industry 4.0, this study examines smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0. First, a conceptual framework of smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 is presented. Second, demonstrative scenarios that pertain to smart design, smart machining, smart control, smart monitoring, and smart scheduling, are presented. Key technologies and their possible applications to Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing systems are reviewed based on these demonstrative scenarios. Finally, challenges and future perspectives are identified and discussed.},

  abstract       = {As the growing proportion of aging population, the demand for sustainable, high quality, and timely healthcare services has become increasingly pressing, especially since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the early of 2020. To meet this demand, a promising strategy is to introduce cloud computing and digital twin techniques into the healthcare systems, where the cloud server is employed for storing healthcare data and offering efficient query services, and the digital twin is used for building digital representation for patients and leverages the query services of the cloud server to monitor healthcare states of patients. Although several cloud computing and digital twin based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been proposed, none of them has considered the data privacy issue, yet the leakage of the private healthcare information may cause catastrophic losses to patients. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving similarity query based healthcare monitoring scheme over digital twin cloud platform, named PSim-DTH. Specifically, we first formalize a similarity query based healthcare monitoring model over digital twin cloud platform. Then, we deploy a partition-based tree (PB-tree) to index the healthcare data and introduce matrix encryption to propose a privacy-preserving PB-tree based similarity range query (PSRQ) algorithm. Based on PSRQ algorithm, we propose our PSim-DTH scheme. Both security analysis and performance evaluation are extensively conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed PSim-DTH scheme is really privacy-preserving and efficient.},

To address the challenge, this study explores a blockchain-based framework for construction quality information management, which extends applications of blockchain in the domain of construction quality management. A consortium blockchain system is designed to support construction quality management in which participants’ information permissions and lifecycle are discussed. Additionally, this study presents in detail the consensus process that aims to address the problem of information fraud. The automated compliance checking based on smart contracts is presented as well, aiming to assure that construction products meet regulation requirements. Finally, an example of the consortium blockchain network is visualized to validate the feasibility of blockchain-based construction quality information management.

  abstract       = {Heavy oil gathering and transportation system is increasingly attention and the realization of intelligent control has become the oilfield development direction and trend in the future. In this paper, boundary temperature is defined as safe inlet temperature and optimal oil transportation temperature. The intelligent supervisory control and data acquisition system was used to collect the production data of an oilfield in Western China in real-time. The heavy oil transportation pipeline was divided into 9 types through big data analysis. The safe inlet temperature under different conditions was determined by flow loop experiments. Then the total heat transfer coefficient was corrected by the least square method, and the optimal oil transportation temperature was calculated by the mathematical model. The results indicated that the relationship of the temperature drop along the pipeline could be more accurately predicted by the modified total heat transfer coefficient. Heavy oil field gathering and transportation system had low-temperature transportation potential in summer and winter. Liquid production, water cut, and the ambient temperature had a significant effect on the temperature gradient and safe inlet temperature. The heavy oil with high liquid production and high water cut had the greatest potential for low-temperature transportation. An oilfield intelligent control and management scheme is proposed to effectively guide heavy oil production. This study is of great significance to guide the optimization of operation parameters of heavy oil field gathering and transportation system, realize energy saving and consumption reduction, and ensure the efficient and stable operation of the pipeline.},

This article presents a comprehensive systematic approach that seeks to support the choice of an appropriate IT infrastructure. It is deliberately aimed at supporting especially non-IT experts, guiding the practitioner through a multi-phase process. The approach is applied to an exemplary use case in the field of industrial technical building equipment, but can also be applied to any application case involving the planning of the IT infrastructure in a manufacturing context. The results illustrate the applicability and the potential of appropriately selecting a suitable IT infrastructure.},

  abstract       = {Industry 4.0 is collaborating directly for the technological revolution. Both machines and managers are daily confronted with decision making involving a massive input of data and customization in the manufacturing process. The ability to predict the need for maintenance of assets at a specific future moment is one of the main challenges in this scope. The possibility of performing predictive maintenance contributes to enhancing machine downtime, costs, control, and quality of production. We observed that surveys and tutorials about Industry 4.0 focus mainly on addressing data analytics and machine learning methods to change production procedures, so not comprising predictive maintenance methods and their organization. In this context, this article presents a systematic literature review of initiatives of predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0, identifying and cataloging methods, standards, and applications. As the main contributions, this survey discusses the current challenges and limitations in predictive maintenance, in addition to proposing a novel taxonomy to classify this research area considering the needs of the Industry 4.0. We concluded that computer science, including artificial intelligence and distributed computing fields, is more and more present in an area where engineering was the dominant expertise, so detaching the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address Industry 4.0 effectively.},
