Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Almeaibed2021.pdf",""

In this paper, we provide an overview of smart grid cybersecurity standards, and review major threats to smart grid environments at the physical, network and application layers. In order to overcome the current lack of standards for security evaluation of smart grids, we propose a digital twins based approach for the complete life cycle of a smart grid, which accurately models the functioning of the physical grid and avoids service disruptions caused by running security tests on the actual grid. A digital twins based approach is promising to provide a common ground for the development of standardized models for continuous and comprehensive penetration testing of smart grids.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Atalay2020.pdf",""

The increase in the penetration of IoT has opened the doors for attackers with now even more surface area prone to attacks. The more machines connected the more the data is exchanged which implies more exposure of information which could be confidential and sensitive. Manufacturing units are the first line of defense in safeguarding a country’s capabilities. The information leaked through these channels is not only economically disastrous but also a serious concern for the security of a nation. There is a growing need to keep a check on the information that could be leaked. Cybersecurity plays an important role in preventing the misuse of the data collected through millions of devices nowadays. First, there is a need to spread awareness about the implications of data theft in the manufacturing environment and then understanding the need for cybersecurity in this environment.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Bajaj2020.pdf",""

Its outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication, consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Becue2020.pdf",""

This chapter also covers major areas of requirements that include: (a) processes with intensive generation of engineering artifacts; (b) challenges regarding dependencies and complexity of engineering artifacts, stemming from variants of a product and the associated production process for a family of products; (c) management of model and consistency rules for dependencies between model parts; (d) the internationalization of the engineering process with partners on different levels of trust; and (e) the security of the engineering processes, such as confidentiality of engineering plans, and the security of the systems to be engineered, such as security aspects in the design phase.  For selected requirement areas, the chapter discusses several approaches for quality improvement from business informatics that addresses important classes of requirements, but introduces new complexity to the engineering process. Therefore, the chapter reviews information security improvement approaches for engineering processes, including the consideration of new security requirements stemming from risks introduced by advanced informatics solutions.

ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system’s topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0–1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Bitton2018.pdf",""

In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin.

However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.","","security operations center, digital twin, security framework, security information and event management","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Dietz2020.pdf",""

In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts.

From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs.

In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.","","industrial control systems, digital twin, automationml, cyber-physical systems, state replication, intrusion detection systems","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Eckhart2018a.pdf",""

These capabilities yield efficiency gains and quality improvements in manufacturing processes. In addition, the concept of digital twins can also be leveraged to advance the security of the smart factory. More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs. However, efficiently creating, maintaining, and running digital twins still represents a major research challenge, as the overhead costs hinder the adoption of this concept.

Digitization, decentralization, and high connectivity, as well as incorporation of various enabling technologies, raise various security issues. These security concerns may affect safety, endangering assets and even human lives. This is especially true for CPS utilization in different sectors of great significance, including manufacturing or critical infrastructures, creating a need for efficiently handling relevant security issues. Including security as part of a software-intensive technical system (i.e., the CPS) that can be distributed and highly resilient highlights the need for appropriate security methodologies to be applied on the CPS from the engineering stage during CPS design. The efficient security-related processes that are implemented at design time have an impact on security monitoring during the CPS operational phase (at run-time). Efficient and accurate security monitoring that follows security-by-design principles can be a potent tool in the hands of the CPS manager for detecting and mitigating cyber threats. Monitoring traffic and activity at the system boundaries, detecting changes to device status and configuration, detecting suspicious activity indicating attacks, detecting unauthorized activity that is suspicious or violates security policies, and timely responding to security incidents and recovering from them are issues that need to be efficiently tackled with by security monitoring. In this chapter, we explore the various CPS cybersecurity threats and discuss how adding security as a parameter at the CPS design phase can provide a well-structured and efficient approach on providing strong security CPS foundations. New technologies on CPS security design are presented and emerging security directions are discussed. Furthermore, in the chapter, the different aspects of security monitoring are presented with a special emphasis on CPSs, discussing the various existing monitoring approaches that are followed in order to detect security issues at run-time.

Smart grid security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to provide its users a platform to train and test cyber attacks, in a safe and controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying physical configuration and difficulty to scale. To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on smart grids. On the developed twin, the users can deploy real world attacks and countermeasures, to test and study its effectiveness. The difference from the physical test-bed is that its users may easily modify their power system components and configurations.

This paper describes how centralized and decentralized DTs can help to monitor and control future power systems with special consideration of their interaction in case of corrupted communication from cyber-attacks. While the virtual representation of substations is regarded from the edge computing perspective the control room of the interconnected power system represents the centralized perspective.

The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.","","Robots;Surgery;Real-time systems;Computer security;Task analysis;Reliability;Digital twin;virtual reality;robot control;mobile networks;network security","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Laaki2019.pdf",""

Traditionally, virtual machines are used to provide an environment that is isolated from production systems so as to not cause any adverse impact on existing infrastructure. Malware developers are fully aware of this and so will often develop evasion techniques to avoid detection within sandbox environments. In this paper, we conduct an investigation into anti-evasion malware triggers for uncovering malware behaviours that may act benign when they detect a traditional sandbox environment. To facilitate our investigation, we developed a dynamic sandbox reconfiguration tool called MORRIGU that couples together both automated and human-driven analysis for anti-evasion configuration testing, along with a visual analytics view for examining system behaviours and performing comparative analysis. Our study reveals a variety of anti-evasion traits that are shared amongst different malware families, such as sandbox `wear-and-tear&amp;rsquo;, and Reverse Turing Tests (RTT), as well as more sophisticated malware samples that require multiple anti-evasion checks to be deployed. Using a systematic testing approach such as MORRIGU enables test coverage of anti-evasion methods, whilst also offering flexibility for further human-driven analysis of additional evasion methods. We also perform a comparative study against automated analysis using Cuckoo sandbox to show that automated scoring alone can not reliably inform on the presence of evasive malware, hence requiring a more sophisticated anti-evasive testing approach. With a greater understanding of anti-evasion malware triggers and with appropriate tools to explore these in an effective and efficient manner, this study helps to advance research on how evasive malware is being utilised to evade analysis so that we can better defend against future attacks.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Mills2021.pdf",""

These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices’ known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.","","Multi-mode systems, Mode switching, Resilience, Security, Industry 4.0, Zero-day vulnerabilities","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Riegler2021.pdf",""

This is no longer considered an uncommon possibility when dealing with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors expected to be state-sponsored and receiving insider assistance. In these extreme adversarial situations, OT defenses aim to provide another layer of defense for the system, introduced directly at the physical process level, as described by the sensors data, the system model, and control actions. Just like IT defenses, two schools of thought, i.e., passive and active defenses, have emerged to address this challenge. In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors.","","Neural network, Deep learning, Cybersecurity, Active monitoring, Reduced-order modeling","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Sundaram2020.pdf",""

To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains’ knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to represent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology provides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system’s knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision-making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.","","Aquaponics 4.0, Industry 4.0, Ontology modeling, Knowledge modeling, Decision support system","",""

Due to enhanced growth in the Cyber-Physical System, privacy and security issues turned out to be the most significant factor all over the world. This paper demonstrates a complete co-design approach meant for integrating the cyberspace and physical space of a cyber-physical system. Various strategies and models regarding cyber and physical space are established in CPS. Apart from numerous co-design strategies, there are several parameters yet to be resolved and established. It becomes complicated and tricky to examine and explore the extremely best value since these parameters make up a very huge space. Therefore, a metaheuristic algorithm such as improved Fuzzy Harmonic Search Algorithm is proposed to optimize the control parameters so as to obtain a feasible solution. Also, this approach minimizes the cost function using Maximum Allowable Delay Bound (MADB) when subjected to several constraints such as the Sampling period, Horizon length, Routing graph, and scheduling table. Moreover the comparative analyses of various approaches such as Fuzzy Harmony Search (FHS) algorithm, Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm as well as Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (Fuzzy GA) are evaluated to examine the performances of the proposed approach. A testbed is organized for evaluation and exploration in a manufacturing atmosphere. The result reveals that this proposed approach provides enhanced control performance and communication reliability even under very harsh environmental habitat.","","","",""

Data has become more ubiquitous with the increase in the development of mobile and wireless networking technologies. Also, due to high expectations for productivity improvement, efficiency, and enabling innovative service through collaborative means, IoT is attracting much attention. CPS is the integration of computational objects in fitting together with the corporal biosphere and its procedures. CPSs are complicated manufacturing systems with the goal to combine and harmonize mechanism biosphere and industrial capability to the cyber computational space. Nevertheless, having thorough interconnectivity and a computational platform is essential for a practicable application of CPSs and smart factories. Smart manufacturing, also known as Industry 4.0 or Industry Internet of Things (IIoT), is increasingly becoming the common goal of various industrial and national strategies. For a better implementation of smart manufacturing, smart interconnection is one of the most significant issues. Current technologies, however, are not yet completely equipped for smart interconnection while working with heterogeneous hardware, fast setup, and delivery, as well as online service generation. In this chapter, the effects of IoT technology and CPS in the advancement and awareness of real-life smart manufacturing is addressed. An integrated IoT and CPS framework is recommended as a specification for researchers and industries toward the full realization of the potentials of IoT with CPS in the development of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing technologies.","","","",""

The so-called digital revolution that began in the 1980s, on the basis of the increasingly widespread use of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics in production processes, is changing the face of world logistics, a change often referred to as Logistics 4.0. Building on the impact of digitalisation on other sectors, port cities are also expected to see the emergence of new business models in the coming years, made possible by the advancement of digital technologies. Some researchers and practitioners even foresee the development of a global cargo handling system similar to the Internet, called Physical Internet (PI), in which goods would be moved seamlessly on an intermodal network at very low costs thanks to state-of-the-art data management technologies. The development of a PI-based logistics model requires new methods of monitoring and managing data, on the physical characteristics of the goods, as well as on the financial flows and traceability of the products; and ports are likely to play a critical role in favouring the uptake of such data collections and use. One of the most promising enablers to this vision is blockchain, a technology that would make it possible to document an increasingly large number of characteristics of a product or a commodity. The shipping sector cannot be caught unprepared, and adequate support is also needed inside ports. This chapter reviews the current technology and digitalisation trends in ports, advancing hypotheses on how they are likely to change port-city cargo—but also people—mobility and influence port logistics.","","","",""

The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.","","Artificial Intelligence, Covid-19, Machine learning, Deep learning, Robotic, Umbrella review, Foresight analysis","",""

Unfortunately, awareness among the businesses regarding their specificity, prevalence and real consequences is limited. This is why identification of major problems of effective shaping of enterprises’ competitiveness in the Industry 4.0 era is the research problem. Consequently, the main goal of the paper is to identify and map the key barriers and potential sources of failure in processes of building competitive advantage of enterprises operating in the age of Industry 4.0, the so-called Black Points and creation of a specific Road Map which is a path/algorithm of actions illustrating how organisations can better prepare themselves to overcome these key barriers. The research was based on a review of the literature on strategic management, competitiveness of businesses, theory on competitive advantage or describing requirements that organisations face in the age of IR 4.0. The collected data was compared with the empirical results of research by global management consultancies who assessed the problems and degree of implementation of IR 4.0 solutions and preparation of enterprises from various countries to the requirements of IR 4.0.","","","",""

Authors identified no studies focussing on presenting a PdM value analysis or cost model specifically for small-medium enterprises (SMEs) operating computer numerically controlled (CNC) MTs. This paper’s novelty is addressing SMEs’ minimal representation in literature by explanatorily collecting data from SMEs within the focal area via surveys, modelling and analysing datasets, then proposes a cost-effective PdM system architecture for SME CNC machine shops that predicts cost savings ranging from £22,804 to £48,585 over a range of 1–50 CNC MTs maintained on a distributed numerically controlled (DNC) network. It affirms PdM’s tangible value creation for SME CNC machine shops with predicted positive impacts on their MT cost and performance drivers. These exploratory research findings corroborate SMEs pooling together to optimise their CNC MT maintenance cost through the recommended system architecture. Finally, it introduces opportunities for further PdM research taking into account SMEs’ perspective. The paper’s industrial application is confirmed from the surveyed SMEs that demonstrated their current utility of PdM; then anonymous positive feedback on the online dashboard, shared with participant companies, confirmed the research results supported SMEs in considering exploring the path to adapting PdM. It is anticipated that beneficiaries of this research will be maintenance managers, business executives and researchers who seek to understand the expected financial and performance impact of adopting PdM for a MT’s overall life cycle costs.","","","",""

Manufacturers need to make sure that the systems function in the intended way and according to specifications. This is not a trivial task as system complexity rises dramatically the more integrated and interconnected these systems become with the addition of automated functionality and features to them. This effort translates into an overhead on the V&V (verification and validation) process making it time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present VALU3S, an ECSEL JU (joint undertaking) project that aims to evaluate the state-of-the-art V&V methods and tools, and design a multi-domain framework to create a clear structure around the components and elements needed to conduct the V&V process. The main expected benefit of the framework is to reduce time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems with respect to safety, cyber-security, and privacy requirements. This is done through identification and classification of evaluation methods, tools, environments and concepts for V&V of automated systems with respect to the mentioned requirements. VALU3S will provide guidelines to the V&V community including engineers and researchers on how the V&V of automated systems could be improved considering the cost, time and effort of conducting V&V processes. To this end, VALU3S brings together a consortium with partners from 10 different countries, amounting to a mix of 25 industrial partners, 6 leading research institutes, and 10 universities to reach the project goal.","","Verification, Validation, Automated systems, Security, Privacy","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Agirre2021.pdf",""

Digital Twin (DT) technology is based on the integration of different traditional tools, such as simulation modeling and sensors, and is aimed at increasing process performance. In DTs, simulation modeling allows for the building of a digital copy of real processes, which is dynamically updated through data derived from smart objects based on sensor technologies. The use of DT within manufacturing activities is constantly increasing, as DTs are being applied in different areas, from the design phase to the operational ones. This study aims to analyze existing fields of applications of DTs for supporting safety management processes in order to evaluate the current state of the art. A bibliometric review was carried out through VOSviewer to evaluate studies and applications of DTs in the engineering and computer science areas and to identify research clusters and future trends. Next, a bibliometric and systematic review was carried out to deepen the relation between the DT approach and safety issues. The findings highlight that in recent years, DT applications have been tested and developed to support operators during normal and emergency conditions and to enhance their abilities to control safety levels.","","","",""

Although cyber–physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber–cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber–cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber–cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber–cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber–cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins.

Digital technological developments have the potential to change our energy supply, trade, and consumption dramatically. The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study’s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security. Given the pace of development in information technology, AI and data analysis, regulatory approvals for new services and products in the new Era of digital energy markets can be enforced as quickly and efficiently as possible.","","Artificial intelligence, Renewable energy, Energy demand, Decision making, Big data, Energy digitization","",""

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently.

It enables customised patient outcomes via the development of novel, targeted medical approaches with a focus on intelligent, data-centric smart healthcare models. Currently, precision healthcare is seen as a challenging model to apply due to the complexity of the healthcare ecosystem, which is a multi-level and multifaceted environment with high real-time interactions among disciplines, practitioners, patients and discrete computer systems. Digital Twins (DT) pairs individual physical artefacts with digital models reflecting their status in real-time. Creating a live-model for healthcare services introduces new opportunities for patient care including better risk assessment and evaluation without disturbing daily activities. In this article, to address design and management in this complexity, we examine recent work in Digital Twins (DT) to investigate the goals of precision healthcare at a patient and healthcare system levels. We further discuss the role of DT to achieve precision healthcare, proposed frameworks, the value of active participation and continuous monitoring, and the cyber-security challenges and ethical implications for this emerging paradigm.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\AhmadiAssalemi2020.pdf",""

Specifically, this paper examines how data acquired from various modalities (i.e., electrodermal activity, gait patterns, visual sensing) can portray environmental demands associated with older adults’ mobility.

Fifteen barriers which can affect the adoption of Health 4.0 in the Indian healthcare sector have been identified through extensive literature review and opinions of healthcare industry and academic experts. A TISM (Total Interpretive Structural Modelling) model has been developed to extract the key barriers influencing Health 4.0 adoption which will guide the healthcare managers and decision makers to explore the effect of each barrier on other barriers as well as the degree of relationships among them. The result shows that lack of top management support, exclusive and skilled workforce requirement, inadequate maintenance support systems and political support are the major barriers as they have strong driving power.

Organizations that want to survive must be ready to adapt to the new digital landscape. The digital transformation process is more than just implementing new technology, investing in tools, or upgrading existing systems. These steps are important, but they are not the whole picture. If an organization wants to stay competitive, it won’t just be able to respond to changes, it should expect them and stimulate innovation itself. To do this, companies need to plan ahead and be active designers for their future. This is where the digital transformation strategy comes in. The digital transformation strategy helps leaders answer the questions for their business such as the current digitalization level, future vision, and how to get there. To be protected from digital disruption, companies need to develop three core competencies related to awareness, informed decision-making, and rapid implementation. The development and implementation of a digital transformation strategy have become a key concern for many organizations across manufacturing industries, but how such a strategy can be developed remains an open question. In this paper, we will be discussing how manufacturing could develop a digital transformation strategy that including a different aspect of the strategy tailored to the nature of the manufacturing sector.","","digital transformation strategy, digitalization, Industry 4.0, manufacturing","",""

Based on the SDN and NFV paradigms, this article introduces a novel elastic computing resource virtualization (ECRV) method to improve the flexibility of resource management in the IIoT. The need for virtualization is obtained by identifying the control and process platforms used in industrial task management. Support vector machine-based classification learning is used to achieve balanced identification, and prevents unnecessary distribution of limited resources, Support vector machine helps to retain flexibility in task control processes that use available industrial resources. By separating the process and control platforms, service dissemination is improved and backlogs in task processing are decreased. The proposed method could provide flexible virtualization and reduces the service response time and task failure.","","IIoT, Network function virtualization, Regression learning, Service flexibility, Software-defined network, Support vector machine","",""

Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.","","IoT, Internet of Things, Security, Cyber security, Secure by Design, Next Generation Internet, Smart city, Sustainable city, Energy reduction, Building Energy Management Systems","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Ande2020.pdf",""

We first point out that the current discourse on 4IR is often based on poor understanding of the true nature of the phenomenon. Emphasising that many of the so-called 4IR technologies have been there and evolving rapidly in the last half a century, we argue that what defines 4IR is the fusion of these technologies. Given this, we argue, rather than trying to master particular 4IR technologies, developing countries should first focus on acquiring what we call the foundational capabilities, i.e. the capabilities to learn new technical and organisational solutions and apply them in creative and flexible ways. Using this perspective, we then discuss in great detail how different 4IR technologies are re-shaping each industry and creating new industries through technological fusion, while discussing how these changes are affecting the opportunities and challenges faced by developing countries for industrial development. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of our findings for industrial policy in developing countries.","","","",""

The purpose of this research is to analyze the readiness level and feasibility of implementing Industry 4.0 technologies for SME’s in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany). The work is based on the survey of 20 SME’s assessing their current problems emphasizing on automation, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), CAD/CAM, factory layout planning and logistics. Five SME’s from different domains out of the 20 surveyed are taken as case studies to evaluate the potential benefits, trade-offs and barriers from an implementation of these integrated technologies.

Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human–machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.","","","",""

This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The interrelations between these groups and individual high-impact publications are visualized using social network analysis. A structured overview of the main strands of research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual connections between publications and discourses is obtained.

Furthermore, novel use cases are created by the digitisation of industry, commonly known as Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things, applications make use of communication and computation technology that is becoming available. This enables novel business use cases, such as the digital twin, customer individual production, and data market places. However, the inter-connectivity such use cases rely on also significantly increases the attack surface of industrial enterprises. Sabotage and espionage are aimed at data, which is becoming the most crucial asset of an enterprise. Since the requirements on security solutions in industrial networks are inherently different from office networks, novel approaches for intrusion detection need to be developed. In this work, process data of a real water treatment process that contains attacks is analysed. Analysis is performed by an extension of Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series. By extending Matrix Profiles with a Hamming-distance metric, binary and tertiary actuators can be integrated into the analysis in a meaningful fashion. This algorithm requires low training effort while providing accurate results. Furthermore, it can be employed in a real-time fashion. Selected actuators in the data set are analysed to highlight the applicability of the extended Matrix Profiles.","","","",""

They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs.

The very special payload and exclusive operational profile, i.e. passengers looking for leisure and entertainment, imply outstanding performances in terms of safety standards and customer satisfaction. Attention to environment is relevant as well, since these ships are used to operate in spectacular marine ecosystems. The need of European shipyards to continuously progress to preserve the market leadership requires a virtuous evolution of the ship design process projected on a life cycle perspective. In this regard Systems Engineering appears to be a robust and reliable paradigm, able to provide the necessary comprehensive view of the cruise ship system as a whole together with a systematic methodological framework that, among the other advantages, enables the active and constructive participation of all the involved stakeholders in the decision-making process. In particular, Systems Engineering strongly relies on the so-called model-based engineering to share, integrate, combine and improve the level of details relevant to the system under development. In this paper the digital twin model will be discussed as a natural evolution of above-mentioned model-based engineering and its utilization in the shipbuilding field will be described as a very promising application especially in the field of cruise ships.","","","",""

Industry 4.0, building on the integration of information and communication technologies, Internet of things, robotics, additive manufacturing, and artificial intelligence, aims for developing autonomous and dynamic operations to enable the mass production of highly customized products. Industry 4.0 and quality management share the same objective, that is, improving process performance, yet through different trajectories. However, notwithstanding Industry 4.0 developments, quality management models have remained stagnant and failed to keep abreast of these advancements. This paper evaluates the alignment of quality management models with Industry 4.0. The paper shows that quality models are not congruent with Industry 4.0. The former build on the paradigm that supports establishing formal systems, compliance with specifications, and meeting requirements which are quite irrelevant to Industry 4.0. The paper compares the features of Industry 4.0 against quality models, highlights inadequacies in quality models, and develops recommendations for future quality models.

Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.","","Supplier audit, Technology-enhanced audits (TEA), Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Transaction cost economics theory, Agency theory, Buyer-supplier relationships","",""

These trends motivate the intense pursuit of battery manufacturing processes that are cost effective, scalable, and sustainable. The digital transformation of battery manufacturing plants can help meet these needs. This review provides a detailed discussion of the current and near-term developments for the digitalization of the battery cell manufacturing chain and presents future perspectives in this field. Current modelling approaches are reviewed, and a discussion is presented on how these elements can be combined with data acquisition instruments and communication protocols in a framework for building a digital twin of the battery manufacturing chain. The challenges and emerging techniques provided here is expected to give scientists and engineers from both industry and academia a guide toward more intelligent and interconnected battery manufacturing processes in the future.","","battery manufacturing, digital twin, digitalization, modelling, sensorization","",""

This breed of ad hoc networks leverages vehicles as nodes with Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication paradigm. Clustering is considered one of the most important techniques used to enhance network stability, reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, clustering employs bandwidth optimization by reducing the overhead and transmission delay and helps in mitigating the hidden node problem. To date, extensive research has been done to address clustering issues in vehicular networks, and several surveys have also been published in the literature. However, a holistic approach towards clustering in vehicular networks is still lacking. In this regard, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent advancements in the clustering schemes for vehicular networks. We take a holistic approach to classify the algorithms by focusing on, (i) the objective of clustering mechanisms (i.e., reliability, scalability, stability, routing overhead, and delay), (ii) general-purpose clustering algorithms, (iii) application-based (i.e., QoS, MAC, security, etc.) clustering, and iv) technology-based clustering (machine learning-based, nature-inspired, fuzzy logic-based and software-defined networking-based clustering). We investigate the existing clustering mechanisms keeping in mind the factors such as cluster formation, maintenance, and management. Additionally, we present a comprehensive set of parameters for selecting cluster heads and the role of enabling technologies for cluster maintenance. Finally, we identify future research trends in clustering techniques for vehicular networks and their various breeds. This survey will act as a one-stop shop for the researchers, practitioners, and system designers to select the right clustering mechanism for their applications, services, or for their research.

This paper focuses on a service based interaction of MES and process control in a modular an interconnected environment to promote process optimization. Another important factor that must be considered is security. Linking the industrial automation with IT technologies is a basis for optimization and digitalization but it exposes the system to security threats. Retrieving process information for further data processing and online system optimization including the controlled process must be accomplished via an approach that ensures the security requirements of the system. This paper discusses such a secure approach for the interaction between process control, MES and a digital twin application.","","Digital twin;Conferences;Process control;Data processing;Control systems;Security;Informatics;Digital Twin;Virtualization;Container Technologies;Process Control","",""

Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.","","internet of things, virtual integration, linked data","",""

Consequently, fault analysis (e.g., fault detection, diagnosis, and prediction) has attracted increased research attention. Investigations involving fault analysis are usually performed using real-time, online, or automated techniques for fault detection or alarming. Conversely, recovery of faulty states to their healthy forms is usually performed manually under offline conditions. However, the development of intelligent systems requires that appropriate feedback be provided automatically, to facilitate faulty-state recovery without the need for manual operator intervention and/or decision-making. To this end, this paper proposes a system integration technique for predictive process adjustment that determines appropriate recovery actions and performs them automatically by analyzing relevant sensor signals pertaining to the current situation of a manufacturing unit via cloud computing and machine learning. The proposed system corresponds to an automated predictive process adjustment module of an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS). The said integrated module collects and analyzes the temperature and vibration signals of a product transporter using an internet-of-things-based programmable logic controller and cloud computing to identify the current states of the ASRS system. Upon detection of faulty states, the control program identifies corresponding process control variables and controls them to recover the system to its previous no-fault state. The proposed system will facilitate automatic prognostics and health management in complex manufacturing systems by providing automatic fault diagnosis and predictive recovery feedback.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Baek2021.pdf",""

The twin is constantly connected to the physical network and combines selective simulation, graph algorithms and a data driven link model into a single toolbox. We evaluated its usage for smart lighting applications on a real-life testbed.

Examples of CPS interacting with humans in industrial production environments are the so-called cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), where operators supervise the industrial machines, according to the human-in-the-loop paradigm. In this scenario, research challenges for implementing CPPS resilience, promptly reacting to faults, concern: (i) the complex structure of CPPS, which cannot be addressed as a monolithic system, but as a dynamic ecosystem of single CPS interacting and influencing each other; (ii) the volume, velocity and variety of data (Big Data) on which resilience is based, which call for novel methods and techniques to ensure recovery procedures; (iii) the involvement of human factors in these systems. In this paper, we address the design of resilient cyber-physical production systems (R-CPPS) in digital factories by facing these challenges. Specifically, each component of the R-CPPS is modelled as a smart machine , that is, a cyber-physical system equipped with a set of recovery services, a Sensor Data API used to collect sensor data acquired from the physical side for monitoring the component behaviour, and an operator interface for displaying detected anomalous conditions and notifying necessary recovery actions to on-field operators. A context-based mediator , at shop floor level, is in charge of ensuring resilience by gathering data from the CPPS, selecting the proper recovery actions and invoking corresponding recovery services on the target CPS. Finally, data summarisation and relevance evaluation techniques are used for supporting the identification of anomalous conditions in the presence of high volume and velocity of data collected through the Sensor Data API. The approach is validated in a food industry real case study.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Bagozi2021.pdf",""

Many virtual systems allow to predict foul conditions, save energy, study special cases, and so on, yet they need to implement new digital tools that allow developing manufacturing process in a better manner. As a result, Digital-Twin platforms are a good alternative since they are virtual models that could receive online and offline data. Thus, programmed algorithms can be evaluated to know the performance of the manufacturing process. These virtualizations and interconnections between elements of the manufacturing process become important components with an increasing role in dealing with supply, production times, and delivery chains as they run in parallel and find optimal performance before implementing these conditions into the real system. This study focuses on the use of a Digital-Twin that integrates a metaheuristic optimization and a direct Simulink model for printed circuit boards (PCB) design and processing focused on the drilling process. The results show that metaheuristic optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin concept as part of the production system into the drilling process. In the first part, it shows that depending on the penalization the optimization focuses on the lower path and forgets on changing the tools, yet as the penalization raises it focuses on finishing drilling with one tool before changing. Second, it is important where on the PCB it starts the drilling, with less time depending on each plaque. Third, it can be observed that using optimization can triple the amount of PCBs that can be manufactured. Finally, on an 8-hr run the Digital-Twin that didn’t use optimization can only work with three different designs, differently with optimization it can have 7-8 changes in the PCB design.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Balderas2021.pdf",""

Most often, these systems have hard-coded cases to achieve a specific set of actions -or to assure the safety of the operations. The hard-coding makes the use complicated to re-deploy a system for different tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to have a flexible framework, which can generate a plan based on an intuitive description with system constraints, while satisfying all safety conditions. In this work, we propose Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)-based autonomy framework for smart-manufacturing systems. Specifically, we describe a general technique for formulating problems using LTL specifications. The use of LTL enables us to specify a manufacturing scenario (e.g. assembly), along with system constraints, as well as assured autonomy. Based on the given LTL formulation, a safe solution satisfying all constraints can be generated using a satisfiability solver. To eliminate the exhaustive and exponential nature of the solver, we reduced the exploration space with a divide and conquer approach in a receding horizon, which brings dramatic improvements in time and enables our solution for real-world applications. Our experimental evaluations indicated that our solution scales linearly as the problem complexity increases. We showcased the feasibility of our approach by integrating TLbased autonomy with the simulations of Gantry robot in Siemens NX Mechatronics Concept Designer and TIA Portal (PLCSIM Advanced) for Siemens S7-1500 TCPU connected to Sinamics drives.","","autonomous cyber-physical systems, linear temporal logic, intelligent manufacturing systems, task planning, safe assured autonomy","",""

CPS are a unique class of intelligent system, where the governing process models for the system (or its parts) are available to inform decision making. The governing physics or chemistry models provide an additional source of information, potentially improving the accuracy of CPS modeling, but also increasing the complexity of the information fusion process. The resource constraints of CPS, however, makes it hard to perform the information fusion within the CPS itself. Moreover, building a large, monolithic model of the complete CPS is also infeasible due to model size and training complexity. The hierarchical and compositional structure of CPS calls for distributed model training and composition. Resource constraints and real-time control needs call for rapid and low-cost training of models, which makes surrogate modeling a promising approach. However, when surrogate models are composed, their approximate nature may lead to larger errors. Further, data-driven models are prone to adversarial attacks, whose impacts may be even more pronounced in a federated model. This position paper highlights the key research challenges in this realm and need for new research.","","accuracy, adversarial, composition, surrogate models, CPS","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Barve2021.pdf",""

This chapter discusses how most of these issues can be addressed through intelligent use of real-time operating data continuously collected from their production facilities. It advocates the use of a data-driven strategy to optimize operational efficiency and maintenance and enable business personnel to quickly and easily take corrective action when abnormal conditions occur. By taking corrective actions in real time, unnecessary costs can be avoided, bottom line profitability is increased, employee safety is maintained, and responsible environmental stewardship is achieved. The strategy uses real-time data infrastructure software as the integration layer between production process control systems (operational technology), business systems, and advanced offline analytics (information technology).","","Digital transformation, Smart manufacturing, Data infrastructure, Digital plant template, Unit template, Operational intelligence, PI Vision, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence","",""

Management of systemic threats requires a paradigm shift from static risk assessment to holistic resilience modeling and evaluation using intelligent, data-driven and run-time approaches. In fact, the complexity and criticality of HCPS requires timely decisions considering many parameters and implications, which in turn require the adoption of advanced monitoring frameworks and evaluation tools. In order to tackle such challenge, we introduce those new paradigms in a framework named RESILTRON, envisioning Digital Twins (DT) to support decision making and improve resilience in HCPS under systemic stress. In order to represent possibly complex and heterogeneous HCPS, together with their environment and stressors, we leverage on multi-simulation approaches, combining multiple formalisms, data-driven approaches and Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling paradigms, through a structured, modular and compositional framework. DT are used to provide an adaptive abstract representation of the system in terms of multi-layered spatially-embedded dynamic networks, and to apply self-adaptation to time-warped What-If analyses, in order to find the best sequence of decisions to ensure resilience under uncertainty and continuous HPCS evolution.","","Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Digital twin;Decision making;Tools;Time factors;Artificial intelligence","",""

Thereby, digitalization develops unlimited potential in terms of innovation, connectivity, efficiency and productivity improvements. However, research and practice still lack a fundamental understanding of the nature of digital technologies. To address this gap, we developed a multi-layer taxonomy of digital technologies that includes eight dimensions structured along the layers of established modular architectures, i.e. service, content, network, and device. Based on our taxonomy, we also identified seven archetypes of digital technologies by means of a cluster analysis. To revise and evaluate our artefacts, we classified 45 digital technologies from the Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies and conducted evaluation rounds with other researchers. Our results contribute to the descriptive knowledge on digital technologies.

In complex products this demands are very difficult to satisfy and partly not realistic with classical methods of statistical process control (SPC).

AI deals with the creation of systems that can learn to mimic human functions, using their previous experience and without any manual intervention. AI refers to analytical methods in the execution of certain tasks, which can replace human intelligence. AI helps computers to learn from experience, adapts to new inputs, and performs tasks of a human nature. From research labs to your living room, AI now lives everywhere. AI has already taken jobs from humans and will continue to do so as it becomes wider and more successful. On the other hand, the IoT is a network of various devices that are linked over the internet and that can capture and exchange data among themselves. IoT helps the devices/objects to observe, identify, and understand a situation or environment without being dependent on human assistance. From everyday objects like kitchen appliances, vehicles, thermostats, and baby monitors to everything else is connected to the Internet through embedded devices.","","Artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, machine learning, deep learning, robotics, expert system, Big Data, blockchain, biometrics","",""

A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example. The rationales and significances of DT-II and IoDTT as well as future research directions of DM are summarized as a conclusion.","","Information integration (II), digital manufacturing (DM), digital twin (DT-I), digital triad (DT-II), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of digital triad things (IoDTT), enterprise architecture (EA), cyber-physical system (CPS), cloud computing (CC), big data analytics (BDA), machine learning (ML), and blockchain technology (BCT)","",""

By creating ultra-realistic multi-physical computational models associated with each unique aircraft and combining them with known flight histories, operators could benefit from a real-time understanding of the vehicle’s current capabilities. One important facet of the Digital Twin program is the detection and monitoring of structural damage. Recently, a method to detect fatigue cracks using the transformation response of shape memory alloy (SMA) particles embedded in the aircraft structure has been proposed. By detecting changes in the mechanical and/or electromagnetic responses of embedded particles, operators could detect the onset of fatigue cracks in the vicinity of these particles. In this work, the development of a finite element model of an aircraft wing containing embedded SMA particles in key regions will be discussed. In particular, this model will feature a technique known as substructure analysis, which retains degrees of freedom at specified points key to scale transitions, greatly reducing computational cost. By using this technique to model an aircraft wing subjected to loading experienced during flight, we can simulate the response of these localized particles while also reducing computation time. This new model serves to demonstrate key aspects of this detection technique. Future work, including the determination of the material properties associated with these particles as well as exploring the positioning of these particles for optimal crack detection, is also discussed.","","","",""

Although Things undergo changes with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications during their lifetime, the WoT TD is currently inteded to be of a static nature. This remains contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things along their lifecycle.

Currently, Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as an attractive option on a pathway towards low emission mobility. Nevertheless, due to the increasing sales and acceptance of EVs, new challenges arise regarding the scarcity of utilized materials, especially regarding lithium-ion battery systems. Battery production is responsible for the major share of the environmental and economical impacts of the overall EV production. In order to tackle these challenges, resource-efficient processes and a circular use are necessary. Today, a variety of new Industry 4.0 technologies (such as high integrated production systems) are affordable and have reached maturity. Like Industry 4.0, also Recycling 4.0 aims at digitalization of processes but with the focus on the End of Life stage of products. The main goal of the German research project Recycling 4.0 is to develop approaches, which enable advanced information creation, transfer and use along the entire supply chain. In this work, a holistic approach towards an advanced circular economy (Recycling 4.0) is shown. This approach combines methods from different areas (such as economics, mechanical engineering, and computer science) and paves the way towards an advanced circular economy. This paper introduces this approach by discussing the current situation of EV recycling and related judicial fundamentals. Furthermore, the overall approach is introduced, and the discipline-specific sub-approaches are discussed in detail.","","Sustainability, Recycling, Information Marketplace, Digitalization","",""

This concept — often referred to as Digital Twin — enables real-time geometry assurance and allows moving from mass production to more individualized production. To master the challenges of a Digital Twin for Geometry Assurance the project Smart Assembly 4.0 gathers Swedish researchers within product development, automation, virtual manufacturing, control theory, data analysis and machine learning. The vision of Smart Assembly 4.0 is the autonomous, self-optimizing robotized assembly factory, which maximizes quality and throughput, while keeping flexibility and reducing cost, by a sensing, thinking and acting strategy. The concept is based on active part matching and self-adjusting equipment which improves geometric quality without tightening the tolerances of incoming parts. The goal is to assemble products with higher quality than the incoming parts. The concept utilizes information about individual parts to be joined (sensing), selects the best combination of parts (thinking) and adjust locator positions, clamps, weld/rivet positions and sequences (acting). The project is ongoing, and this paper specifies and highlights the infrastructure, components and data flows necessary in the Digital Twin in order to realize Smart Assembly 4.0. The framework is generic, but the paper focuses on a spot weld station where two robots join two sheet metal parts in an adjustable fixture.","","","",""

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.","","Digital Twin, BIM, Review, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Internet of Things (IoT), Framework, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big data, Construction safety, Construction site","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Boje2020.pdf",""

We first validate the use of Wikipedia for emerging technologies and for cross-language comparisons as a tool for (almost) real time strategic analysis. We then extract all Wikipedia pages related to Industry 4.0, build up a knowledge network and study its topological properties in the two editions. We find striking differences, which can be explained with respect to the persistence of the industrial pattern of specialization of Germany with respect to all other countries. Emerging technologies introduce novelty but also preserve path-dependency in the pattern of specialization.

ARTI models architecture elements of reality as intelligent beings in a dominant position relative to their related decision-making components modelled as intelligent agents. The reviews start with overviews of the creation process, the structural elements - holon classes and the features - aggregation, specialization, abstraction levels, flexibility and scalability. The needs that led to the evolution of PROSA into ARTI are analysed: the difficulties to spread the architecture in the research community and industry, the lack of suitability to act as reference architecture for Cyber-Physical Production Systems and Industrial Internet of Things framework in the Industry 4.0 vision of future manufacturing. The reviews discuss the elements and coverage of ARTI, and the translation of basic and staff PROSA holons into new abstract categories: intelligent beings-agents, types-instances, and resources-activities. It is appreciated that, beyond the problem of terminology of PROSA holons difficult to apply in other domains than manufacturing, the move to ARTI assures in-depth interoperability, access to the world-of-interest through digital twins that interact with smart control systems influencing thus these intelligent beings (e.g., plant, shop floor, healthcare system, environment facility, supply chain, service system) into the desired behaviours. From the software implementing point of view, most of the reviewers agreed on the fact that none of the programming languages except for Erlang provided acceptable levels of viability and sustainability for PROSA application classes. An interesting point of view is formulated about the possibility to use ARTI for Enterprise Integration and Interoperability. The present discussions appreciates the new ARTI reference architecture together with D-MAS pattern as an enhanced model to build flexible, intelligent and robust control systems based on prioritizing situation awareness and real-world interoperability. This scientific discussion about the new ARTI model, initiated, presented and critically analysed for the first time in the SOHOMA scientific community needs to be continued by the research community for enrichment and industry adoption.","","","",""

Building a huge infrastructure for the verification purposes is often too costly and impractical in the production environment therefore it is necessary to find other ways to test architectural approaches and algorithms. One of them is simulators. For simulating very big systems like a telecommunications radio access network the simulator should have certain features: capability of simulating a huge number of services, possibility to model heterogenic and vast network, facility to add a new type of services and logic. This paper presents a concept of such a simulator of services.","","service discovery, microservices, simulation, edge cloud","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Bosak2019.pdf",""

Digital transformation happens within a company after three basic stages: operational processes, customer experience, and business models. The article considers the digital transformation of business models particularly within the retail sector, using a comparative analysis of platforms (ecosystems) and traditional business models. On the one hand, digital platforms provide favourable opportunities; on the other hand, they challenge market monopolization. Digital platforms have generated new types of businesses; as an example, platform-based companies have empowered new value chain sources and a competitive environment. The article establishes the definitions and characteristics of business platform models, and points out the advantages and challenges with which the retail market is faced, as well as the benefits that ecosystem participants enjoy. The author emphasizes the significance of ecosystems that allow value to increase without the owner’s participation. Ecosystems are time and labour saving, thus offer endless opportunities. In conclusion, the author points out that digital technologies and virtual companies transform conventional retail businesses, driving up the popularity of omnichannel business models. Furthermore, introducing business platforms requires considerable changes in management, otherwise this can be undermined.","","","",""

This chapter examines the latest digital approach to the oil and gas industry that is the enabler to connected metering. Connected metering is digital transformation that is emerging for Industrial Internet of Things in which ubiquitous connectivity is coupled to cloud-borne data analytics and storage systems in enhancing metering accuracy and reliability. Metering has seen a tremendous growth since its early introduction in the 1800s in terms of both technology and market size. Connectivity is that enabled by the digital economy and its ubiquitous connectivity. Condition based monitoring is largely operating within the oil and gas industry as a stranded asset and typically for ultrasonic meters. A positive-unexpected consequence of collecting data within a digitization strategy is that further subsets of data may be readily formed from the larger master data sets bringing about new insights.","","connected metering, digital economy, gas industry, Industrial Internet of Things, measurements, oil industry, process control","",""

With embedded connectivity units this changes so that manufacturers can gather data from vehicle in-build sensors and thus, gain insights into each products usage. Our study investigates why manufacturers aim to integrate connectivity units into their products to gather sensor based usage information and what hinders them to do so. Thereby, we aim to identify the factors that have an influence on the decision of vehicle manufacturers to adopt the concept of the vehicle digital twin. To unveil those factors, we conducted 30 expert interviews at two vehicle manufacturers in which we found benefits and barriers regarding the realization of a product digital twin. By conceptualizing the benefits and barriers, which have a positive or negative influence on the adoption decision from the perspective of the manufacturers, we were able to derive general influences on the adoption decision. In our adapted technology-organization-environment framework we found influences in the technological (i.e. product data and product heterogeneity), the organizational (i.e. business model orientation, readiness of internal processes and digital culture) and the environmental (i.e. competitors behaviour, legal regulations and customer demand) dimension.","","","",""

Furthermore, existing PLM IS do not support product related tasks after the manufacturing phase. In order to understand the impact of data from connected products as new sources of information on PLM, we conducted a systematic literature review. Our results led to a topic map that identifies drivers, use cases and barriers and contextualizes them. We further analyzed existing PLM models that support the analysis of product instance data. We found that the existing PLM IS have several limitations which hinder a successful realization in practice. The results of this review are a first step towards understanding how the Internet of Things (IoT) influences PLM on a firm level.","","","",""

Usually, such blockchain solutions claim to be disruptive. Often, such disruptiveness takes the form of a proclaimed blockchain revolution. In this paper, we want to look at blockchain technology from a neutral, analytical perspective. Our aim is to understand technological and socio-economic barriers to blockchain solutions that are intrinsic in the blockchain technology stack itself. We look into the permissionless blockchain as well as the permissioned blockchain. We start with a characterization of cryptocurrency as one-tiered uncollateralized M1 money. We proceed with defining essential modes of business communications (message authentication, signature, registered letter, contract, order etc.) and how they are digitized classically. We review potential blockchain solutions for these modes of communications, including socio-economic considerations. At the technical level, we discuss scalability issues and potential denial-of-service attacks. On the other hand, we also look into four successful blockchain solutions and explain their design. Now: what is the blockchain revolution and how realistic is it? Will it shake up of our institutions? Or, vice versa: does it have to rely on a re-design of our institutions instead? Can we design useful blockchain solutions independent of fundamental institutional re-design? It is such questions which have motivated us to compile this paper and we hope that we are able to bring some light to them.","","","",""

In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT?

Therefore, Fog Computing has been proposed to be an edge component for the IoT networks as a remedy to this problem. In recent times, cyber-attacks are on the rise, especially towards infrastructure-less networks, such as IoT. Many botnet attack variants (Mirai, Torii, etc.) have shown that the tiny microdevices at the lower spectrum of the network are becoming a valued participant of a botnet, for further executing more sophisticated attacks against infrastructural networks. As such, the fog devices also need to be secured against cyber-attacks, not only software-wise, but also from hardware alterations and manipulations. Hence, this article first highlights the importance and benefits of fog computing for IoT networks, then investigates the means of providing hardware security to these devices with an enriched literature review, including but not limited to Hardware Security Module, Physically Unclonable Function, System on a Chip, and Tamper Resistant Memory.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Butun2020a.pdf",""

This has been defined by the authors to be “The use and integration of biological and bio-inspired principles, materials, functions, structures and resources for intelligent and sustainable manufacturing technologies and systems with the aim of achieving their full potential. In this White Paper, detailed consideration is given to the meaning and implications of “Biologicalisation from the perspective of the design, function and operation of products, manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, supply chains and organisations. The drivers and influencing factors are also reviewed in detail and in the context of significant developments in materials science and engineering. The paper attempts to test the hypothesis of this topic as a breaking new frontier and to provide a vision for the development of manufacturing science and technology from the perspective of incorporating inspiration from biological systems. Seven recommendations are delivered aimed at policy makers, at funding agencies, at the manufacturing research community and at those industries involved in the development of next generation manufacturing technology and systems. It is concluded that it is valid to argue that Biologicalisation in Manufacturing truly represents a new and breaking frontier of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 and that the market potential is very strong. It is evident that extensive research and development is required in order to maximise on the benefits of a biological transformation.","","Industrie 4.0, Manufacturing, Biologicalisation in Manufacturing, Biological transformation, International perspective, Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, Digitalisation, Bio-inspired, Bio-intelligent, Bio-integrated","",""

Four independent demonstrators from different sections of the manufacturing value chain and involving bio-inspiration, bio-integration and/or bio-intelligence were selected to test the following hypothesis: “That Future Manufacturing Systems will incorporate Components, Features, Characteristics and Capabilities that enable the convergence towards Living Systems. Each of these four demonstrators have succeeded in supporting this hypothesis and in providing clear evidence to confirm that significant performance benefits may be derived through the “biologicalisation of advanced manufacturing systems. This conclusion is of great significance for the next phases of development of manufacturing science and engineering globally. The evidence reported in this paper provides a robust basis for recommending that a deeper analysis of the implications of biologicalised manufacturing systems be undertaken. As a result of this early stage work, it is concluded that there is a high likelihood that this new convergence will lead to a major paradigm shift in advanced manufacturing. Outstanding opportunities exist for high levels of innovation in the next stages of development of advanced manufacturing processes and systems from the biological perspective. The relationship between the human and the physical manufacturing system will also change and the world of advanced manufacturing will be confronted with many new challenges including important ethical questions.","","Biologicalisation, Manufacturing systems, High performance, Convergence, Living, Biology, Engineering, Sustainability, Bio-intelligence, Bio-integration, Bio-inspiration","",""

Moreover, the chapter will determine the actualized benefit of transitioning towards Industry 4.0, separate from the recognized benefits under the literature. In order to achieve this a content analysis was conducted on the 2017 annual activity reports of manufacturing firms listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST). Out of the 178 listed manufacturing firms under BIST, only 20 were identified as transitioning towards Industry 4.0. Out of these 20 firms, 16 firms’ annual activity reports mentioned transitioning towards Industry 4.0 and addressed the outcome (benefits) of the applications. Items were subjected to a content analysis based on business functions (Theme 1), sub-categories of business functions (Theme 2) and the common actual benefit (Theme 3) by three different researchers. The unit of analysis, the identified benefits, were 232 items in total and spread across the operations (41%), strategic management (Cost and Competitive Advantage) (22%), technology and process development (15%), procurement and distribution (12%), human resources (8%) and marketing (2%) business functions.","","","",""

Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.","","anomaly detection, clustering, digital-twin, RFID trajectory","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Cai2019.pdf",""

This conversion is driving the expansion of renewable energy facilities such as photovoltaic plants and wind power plants. Except for large hydropower plants and offshore wind farms, the integration of renewable energies takes place predominantly in the medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. This leads to a lack of observability and increasing grid complexity. Consequently, distribution network operators are constantly faced with a challenge in terms of observability. A comprehensive installation of measuring instruments in the medium- and low-voltage networks has proved economically unviable. An alternative approach to network state monitoring within the framework of power grid digital twin (DT) is therefore developed in this paper. The patterns of the electrical energy system are detected and modeled employing an artificial neural network (ANN) in connection with the associated harmonic spectra. Based on this DT model, the active powers of renewable energy facilities are estimated through the measured voltage data. In this regard, this work is first devoted to the modeling of an ANN-based DT estimator. The proposed power state estimation is then validated with the measured data from a field test. The accuracy of the estimation will be investigated according to the different influencing factors.","","Renewable energy sources;Power measurement;Distribution networks;Artificial neural networks;Power system harmonics;Wind power generation;Harmonic analysis;network state monitoring;digital twin;artificial neural network;harmonic spectra","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Cai2021.pdf",""

In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.","","Resilience, Dependability, Fault-tolerance, Self-healing, Self-repair, Diagnostics, Prognostics, Event correlation, Log analytics, Embedded systems, Cyber–physical systems, Internet of Things","",""

For instance, they can accurately superimpose the face of an individual over the body an actor in a destination video (i.e., face swap), or exactly reproduce the voice of a person and speak a given text. As a result, many are concerned with the potential risks in terms of cybersecurity. Although most focused on the malicious applications of this technology, in this paper we propose a system for using deepfakes for beneficial purposes. We describe the potential use and benefits of our proposal and we discuss its implications in terms of human factors, security risks, and ethical aspects.","","","",""

Indeed, the large scientific area of CPPS makes it difficult to identify clearly and rapidly, in the various applications that were made of CPPS, what are the choices, best practices and methodology that are suggested and that could be used for a new application.

In addition to this, real-time collaborative platforms help designers shorten the product development cycle by enabling collaborations with domain experts from concept generation to product realization and after-market. These collaborations are extending beyond enterprise and national boundaries, contributing to a growing concern among designers regarding the security of their sensitive information such as intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets. The source of such sensitive information leaks could be external (e.g., hacker) or internal (e.g., disgruntled employee) to the collaboration. From a designer's perspective, this fear can inhibit participation in a collaboration even though it might result in better products or services. In this paper, we aim to contextualize this evolving security space by discussing various security practices in digital domains, such as encryption and secret sharing, as well as manufacturing domains, such as physically unclonable function (PUF) and physical part watermarking for anticounterfeiting and tamper evidence purposes. Further, we classify these practices with respect to their performance against different adversarial models for different stages in product development.

Traditional frameworks work in small, single manager environments, but are impractical in even medium sized, complex, or distributed multi- manager environments such as smart homes, smart buildings, and smart cities. Our framework is built upon the Liberated Object Location System (LOLS) that provides a distributed, decentralized, secure, and consumer oriented system that merges a control management framework for data collection and analysis with the consumers and the smart elements in the environment. Digital twins, or proxy services, are created for each device. LOLS provides a directory service for each device and its digital twin, allowing consumers to interact with the connected devices in the environment either directly or through the digital twin. Digital twins may exist at multiple levels in the information hierarchy, allowing for localized, regional, or even global functional scope. All digital twins are integrated with the environment control and management functionality, allowing for scalable, distributed smart environments that provide a consumer accessible interface for each smart device.","","Smart buildings;Smart cities;Digital twin;Smart homes;Data collection;Smart devices;Consumer electronics","",""

Then cloud computing and its re-structuring on traditional industrial software system are discussed. Shift from classic single approach, this research proposes an industrial design and development software system architecture based on model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and cloud computing. The new architecture is shown in a stereoscopic way which amply utilizes the respective advantages of MBSE and cloud computing. At the end of the paper, as an example of actual cases, a flight management system (FMS) design and development platform is detailed to verify the effectiveness of this new architecture. The implement of new system architecture creates an efficient collaborative mechanism for FMS developing.","","Industrial Software System, Model-Based Systems Engineering, Cloud Computing, Industrial Internet-of-Things, System Architecture","",""

In order to be able to link and use such heterogeneous data, spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities can play an important role in establishing interoperability between systems and platforms. Based on the open and international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) concept integrates different sensors, IoT devices, simulation tools, and 3D city models within a common operational framework. However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. Also, there are various users and applications who prefer to work with all the systems in convenient ways using Single-Sign-On. This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration. Such access control and security federation based realization has not been considered in spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities before.","","Smart Cities, Security, SAML, OAuth2, Single-Sign-On, CityGML","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Chaturvedi2019.pdf",""

Germany announced the Industry 4.0 strategy in 2013. The US government launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) in 2011 and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in 2014. Most recently, the Manufacturing USA initiative was officially rolled out to further “leverage existing resources... to nurture manufacturing innovation and accelerate commercialization by fostering close collaboration between industry, academia, and government partners. In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed.

Due to its fast-networking ability, it is widely used in smart cities, car networking, military, agriculture, medicine, and other fields. Routing technology is a key technology in the field of MANET (mobile ad hoc network). The energy consumption is optimized through the technical network simulator NS-3, and the nodes in the MANET routing protocol can accurately simulate the problem, thereby optimizing the MAC layer of important research tools. This article combines the advantages of the lithium-ion (lithium) battery model. Compared with the KiBaM battery model, the effective charge in the KiBaM model simulates the output voltage well, which can reflect the battery capacity effect rate and the recovery effect of the lithium-ion-KiBaM battery model. The model can respond to the characteristics of the output voltage as the society gets lower and lower. In order to solve the problem that the analytic solution of differential equations cannot be obtained in the model, a numerical solution of the optimization algorithm is proposed based on the implicit Runge–Kutta method. The MAC layer energy consumption and routing protocol optimization algorithm proposed in this paper can be applied well in various fields.","","","",""

This paper proposes a federated parallel data platform (FPDP) that provides an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, such as virtual data generation, federation model construction, and parallel data deduction.

However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.","","digital twin, robot operating system, cyber-physical systems, goal structuring notation, assurance case, self-adaptive systems","",""

This leads to the system being prone to physical-to-cyber domain attacks that affect the confidentiality. Physical actions are governed by energy flows, which may be observed. Some of these observable energy flows unintentionally leak information about the cyber-domain and hence are known as the side-channels. Side-channels such as acoustic, thermal, and power allow attackers to acquire the information without actually leveraging the vulnerability of the algorithms implemented in the system. As a case study, we have taken cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems (fused deposition modeling-based three-dimensional (3D) printer) to demonstrate how the acoustic side-channel can be used to breach the confidentiality of the system. In 3D printers, geometry, process, and machine information are the intellectual properties, which are stored in the cyber domain (G-code). We have designed an attack model that consists of digital signal processing, machine-learning algorithms, and context-based post processing to steal the intellectual property in the form of geometry details by reconstructing the G-code and thus the test objects. We have successfully reconstructed various test objects with an average axis prediction accuracy of 86% and an average length prediction error of 11.11%.","","","",""

Thus, this chapter aims to present a broad overview of the most common methods and techniques, including processing data platforms, used for analytics applied to large volume of unstructured, semistructured, and structured data coming with high velocity. Moreover, the tutorial character of this material helps to develop some capabilities in analyzing small data, to be followed up with massive amounts of data.","","Analytics, Dashboard, Machine Learning, Processing","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Chitu2019.pdf",""

However, there is a growing concern among users regarding the security risks associated with CPS. Especially with rising number of cyber-attacks on CPS, such as modifying sensor readings, interrupting operations, etc. Therefore, this paper describes a security surveillance framework to detect deviations in the ecosystem by incorporating a digital twin supported anomaly detection model. The reason for incorporating digital twins is that they add value by enabling real-time monitoring of connected smart farms. We pre-process the collected data from sensors deployed on the smart farm setup. The pre-processed data is fused with our smart farm ontology to populate a knowledge graph. The generated graph is further queried to extract the necessary sensor data. We utilize the extracted normal data to train the anomaly detection model. Further, we tested our model if it identifies abnormal values from sensors by simulating anomalous use case scenarios specific to our ecosystem.","","Digital twin;Surveillance;Ecosystems;Ontologies;Real-time systems;Data models;Security;Security Surveillance;Cyber-Physical System;Digital Twins;Knowledge Graphs;Artificial Intelligence","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Chukkapalli2021a.pdf",""

This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that.In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.","","smart ecosystems, digital ecosystems, reference architecture, software ecosystems, collaborative embedded systems, smart grid, automotive smart ecosystem","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Cioroaica2019a.pdf",""

It turns out that with regard to data decentralism, sovereignty and compatibility through global standardization are key success factors. Hence, second, this paper presents a concept for a shared digital twin providing data on demand, i.e. at the right time and in particular with data condensed to the concrete need, thus, minimizing volume.

Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.","","internet of things, digital twins, multi-agent systems","",""

These technologies are posed to fundamentally change assembly lines around the world. Assembly systems transformed by I4.0 technology integration are referred to here as Assembly 4.0 (A4.0). While most I4.0 new technologies are known, and their integration into shop floors is ongoing or imminent, there is a gap between this knowledge and understanding the form and the impact of their full implementation in assembly systems. The path from the new technological abilities to improved productivity and profitability has not been well understood and has some missing parts. This paper strives to close a significant part of this gap by creating a road map to understand and explore the impact of typical I4.0 new technologies on A4.0 systems. In particular, the paper explores three impact levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. On the strategic level, we explore aspects related to the design of the product, process, and the assembly system. Additionally, the paper elaborates on likely changes in assembly design aspects, due to the flexibility and capabilities that these new technologies will bring. Strategic design also deals with planning and realizing the potential of interactions between sub-assembly lines, kitting lines, and the main assembly lines. On the tactical level, we explore the impact of policies and methodologies in planning assembly lines. Finally, on the operational level, we explore how these new capabilities may affect part routing and scheduling including cases of disruptions and machine failures. We qualitatively assess the impact on performance in terms of overall flow time and ability to handle a wide variety of end products. We point out the cases where clear performance improvement is expected due to the integration of the new technologies. We conclude by identifying research opportunities and challenges for advanced assembly systems.","","","",""

Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database.

Consequently, there is a greater need for their ability to perform their required functions under expected and unexpected adverse events. Moreover, the multitude of threats and their rapid evolution pushes the development of approaches that go beyond pure technical reliability, rather encompassing multi-dimensional performance of a socio-technical system. These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.","","Safety, Security, Business continuity, Cybersecurity, Socio-technical systems, Cyber resilience","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Colabianchi2021.pdf",""

As a result, this paper explores this relationship by employing a mixed methods approach. A qualitative analysis using in-depth interviews and multiple case studies identifies prominent barriers and incentives, whilst a quantitative analysis on a representative sample of 500 local manufacturing units in Piedmont (a region of Northern Italy) is undertaken via an OLS regression-based path analysis. The results of the parallel-serial multiple mediation model show that: (1) greater openness to Industry 4.0 is related to better performance; (2) greater openness to Industry 4.0 leads to a higher perception of barriers; (3) greater knowledge-related and economic and financial barriers improve performance, abstracting from the adoption of incentives; and (4) greater openness to Industry 4.0 drives the adoption of incentives. However, perceived economic and financial barriers are found not to drive firms to adopt more incentives. The study contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying previously unidentified strengths and weaknesses to barriers and incentives, and highlights the necessity of policies that reflect real firms’ needs.","","Industry 4.0, Openness, Performance, Barriers, Incentives, Mediators","",""

The emergence of the concept of Cyber Physical System (CPS) and big data imperatively enable manufacturing to become smarter and more competitive among nations. Many researchers have proposed new solutions with big data enabling tools for manufacturing applications in three directions: product, production and business. Big data has been a fast-changing research area with many new opportunities for applications in manufacturing. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of big data in manufacturing. Six key drivers of big data applications in manufacturing have been identified. The key drivers are system integration, data, prediction, sustainability, resource sharing and hardware. Based on the requirements of manufacturing, nine essential components of big data ecosystem are captured. They are data ingestion, storage, computing, analytics, visualization, management, workflow, infrastructure and security. Several research domains are identified that are driven by available capabilities of big data ecosystem. Five future directions of big data applications in manufacturing are presented from modelling and simulation to real-time big data analytics and cybersecurity.","","Smart manufacturing, Big data, Cloud computing, Cloud manufacturing, Internet of things, NoSQL","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Cui2020.pdf",""

Since its initial German conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the Industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms − such as “smart manufacturing, “digital transformation, and “fourth industrial revolution − have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts. The review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. Each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. This categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets.","","Industry 4.0, Fourth industrial revolution, Smart manufacturing, Definition, Conceptual framework, Literature review","",""

In this paper we present fresh insights related to the application of the novel blockchain technology in reducing pollutions. We analyse recent literature on blockchain technology and propose ways of the utilization of blockchain technology in the maritime industry. Special interest for maritime industry specialists represents the perspectives of the utilization of the blockchain technology in improving the environmental efficiency of the maritime industry. The technology has a broad range of applicability, allowing connecting the supply chain more efficiently, providing the exchange and visibility of time-stamped proofed data, decreasing the industry operational costs with intermediaries and increasing security. It also allows full visibility for all parties involved with proof of work, facilitating Class Societies inspections, Port State Control and audits compliance. The results of the study also show that cases on blockchain application in other fields increase the industry willingness to its application on the maritime industry. While having blockchain implementation specialized third parties would increase the implementation possibility and the industry willingness due to reduced costs and friction. The study will be interesting for scholars, policy-makers and practitioners from the maritime industry.","","","",""

Industry 4.0 will transform entire production systems and products. However, the subject still lacks systematic study in its state of the art. This study seeks to identify relations or associations among emerging technologies in Industry 4.0. Through publications on its theme and keywords, a data mining technique was applied to help identify the network of associations with a new bibliometric approach. In order to reach the objective of the study, we utilized the Apriori algorithm in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software. In this process, 15 association rules were found that met the input metrics: support, confidence, and lift. The rules point to two main technologies, internet of things and cyber-physical systems. This research points out that these technologies are key elements of Industry 4.0, and are related to others, such as cloud, big data, automation, virtualization, and robotics. Through data mining, the best associations and relations of the technologies in Industry 4.0 were identified. Moreover, this study pointed out the most important technologies for the new industrial revolution and the complementary technologies of each identified group. Thus, this network of technologies provides a basic guide for future works, which seek to deepen the characteristics of these relations.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\DaCosta2019.pdf",""

The fourth industrial revolution originates from the increased power of computers that follow Moore's law stipulating that their power doubles every 18 months. Artificial intelligence (AI) is based on machine learning, which itself includes deep learning. Deep learning utilizes algorithms called artificial neural networks. The transition to digital technology and AI has brought in its wake a number of digital tools and methods that have changed the landscape of the company and its means of production.

These capabilities yield efficiency gains and quality improvements in manufacturing processes. In addition, the concept of digital twins can also be leveraged to advance the security of the smart factory. More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs. However, efficiently creating, maintaining, and running digital twins still represents a major research challenge, as the overhead costs hinder the adoption of this concept. We believe that these insights are valuable to shape future research in this emerging research area at the intersection of digital twins and information security.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\DamjanovicBehrendt2018.pdf",""

In the meantime, the increasing penetration of an array of information technologies and controllable devices together suggests that the communications networks enact critical roles in the electric power infrastructure. Indeed, reconfiguration of the current structure of the multi-carrier energy networks by incorporating the advanced communication protocols is one of the essential steps in the grid modernization process. Therefore, this chapter is developed to introduce the required communication systems for modernizing future energy networks. In this regard, the key role of the communication platforms in coordinating the grid agents is examined considering the effective participation of the various control centers and intelligent devices throughout the modern grid. Also, this chapter investigates how to implement some effective technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) in the modern energy grid by adopting capable technologies such as the Internet of Energy while satisfying the modern energy networks’ standards.","","","",""

Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.","","Deep learning;Power measurement;Digital twin;SCADA systems;Power grids;Phasor measurement units;Sensor systems;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Digital Twin;Smart Grid;Cyber Physical System;Wide Area Monitoring System;Anomaly Detection;Fault Detection","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Danilczyk2021.pdf",""

Virtual laboratories are described as an example of using digital twins not only in industry but also for educational purposes. The article is also focused on the value of physical and virtual investigations through the prism of content and language integrated learning approach (CLIL) and it offers recommendations for combining the two to strengthen science inquiry learning and job-relevant learning. Students conduct online investigations resulting in interdisciplinary team interaction and knowledge integration. Adopting the CLIL approach changes engineering students’ attitudes to learning a foreign language, drums up their academic interest, and strengthens their motivation. In addition, the article describes how neural networks are applied for the simulation of physical processes in a virtual laboratory. The advantages of using virtual laboratories for professional-oriented training include linking observable and unobservable phenomena, pointing out essential information, and providing online, adaptive guidance. To evaluate the efficiency of the virtual laboratory environment, we conducted an experiment to assess the effectiveness of an integrated learning course with the elements of a virtual laboratory. The sample was 48 students (23 of them were enrolled on the course based on integrated learning with elements of virtual environment; 25 students studied professional discipline and professional English separately). To collect the data two online testing on English were conducted. The professional discipline was evaluated once at the end of the semester. In addition, we conducted an online survey on motivation for students of both groups to reveal the influence of educational process organization on this indicator. The results of the experiment allowed us to ascertain that the CLIL approach in the virtual laboratory environment resulted in better outcomes and helped the students adopt a more positive attitude to learning English.","","","",""

Opportunities accrue from a broader, more customized product space and accelerated dynamic, and precision manufacturing, drawing upon the cumulative impacts of every step across entire enterprise value and supply chains. Significantly increased energy, material and workforce productivity and improved environment sustainability are pathways to opportunities as well as outcomes of enterprise optimization. This paper returns smart manufacturing (SM) as a term of “practice to its roots, revisiting it as a forward looking term about next-generation operations technology (OT) and information technology (IT) integration based on the manufacturing objectives that originally defined it. Building meaning through a lens of practices that orchestrate capabilities to achieve business and operational objectives makes it possible to describe SM itself as set of practices that distinguish it from today’s 40-year history of applying IT to manufacturing. Key practices at SM’s core are centered on: business and technology; seams and an OT/IT journey; OT/IT enterprise workflow modeling; cyberinfrastructure and reference architecture; and workforce, innovation, and marketplace.","","Advance manufacturing, Digital manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Intelligent manufacturing, Manufacturing 4.0, Smart manufacturing","",""

I4.0 is a vision of increasing flexibility and efficiency within a system of low complexity. Despite this intention, Industry 4.0 has required users to understand complex information and communication systems, limiting usability and therefore not necessarily satisfying the original vision. However, application of principles from the Lean Production Systems originally developed in the 1930’s in combination with Industry 4.0, may help to reach its desired goals. Through a literature review, this paper discusses the current state of art of Industry 4.0 and some Lean Production Systems principles. The paper focuses on a model combining Lean Production Systems with Industry 4.0, that was created in response to the shortcomings of the anticipated industrial revolution. With a Lean Production System as a foundation, the six design principles of I4.0 of interoperability, virtualization, decentralization, real-time capability, service orientation, and modularity can be better implemented to reach the vision of highly flexible and low complexity systems. In return, horizontal and vertical integration within Industry 4.0 can support and accelerate Lean principles by reducing human error and increasing intercommunications between the systems, resulting in a productive integration. The specific principles of Lean that could boost Industry 4.0 will be discussed, demonstrating why a company should be Lean, meaning value adding processes and stakeholder orientation are at its core.","","Lean Production Systems, Industry 4.0, Transparency, Interoperability, Decentralization, Stakeholder Orientation","",""

The paper at hand proposes a security solution based on the management of security events within IoT scenarios in order to accurately identify suspicious activities. To this end, different vulnerabilities found in IoT devices are described, as well as unique features that make these devices an appealing target for attacks. Finally, three IoT attack scenarios are presented, describing exploited vulnerabilities, security events generated by the attack, and accurate responses that could be launched to help decreasing the impact of the attack on IoT devices.

We demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to the synthesis of query structures -- abstract data types with SQL-like query and insert operations. Fiat includes a library for writing specifications of query structures in SQL-inspired notation, expressing operations over relations (tables) in terms of mathematical sets. This library includes a suite of tactics for automating the refinement of specifications into efficient, correct-by-construction OCaml code. Using these tactics, a programmer can generate such an implementation completely automatically by only specifying the equivalent of SQL indexes, data structures capturing useful views of the abstract data.

The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT’s structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.","","Digital Twin, BIM, Cyber-Physical Systems, Conceptual Models, Process Models, Maturity Models","",""

MoC is a process for evaluating and controlling modifications to facility design, operation, organization, or activities—prior to implementation—to be sure no new hazards are introduced. Traditionally, MoC is related to technical changes. Safety implications from organizational changes have recently led to proposed integrated management of both types. An inadequate MoC is recognized as a recurring cause of accidents, often resulting in major accidents, mainly in the process industry. Despite this recognised criticality, the MoC workflow in many companies is still far from being mature and there are still evident shortcomings in its application that have to be compensated. The technical solutions composed by the enabling technologies within Industry 4.0 can offer a valid support to overcome the MoC shortcomings, as will be discussed within this chapter.","","","",""

Unfortunately, it lacks a common and sustainable theoretical fundament. Further, it is unclear which role the characteristics of the affected industries, firms and markets play regarding the impact that the digital transformation has on them.  Method: Taking up these two challenges in a combined fashion for one of the economically most important, but also most specialized and physical global industries, we systematically review the latest literature on the digital transformation within the manufacturing context.  Results: This work is the first one that provides a valid theoretical basis on the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry. Thereby, it becomes clear that this basis is severely depending on its context. In particular, we show that the manufacturing industry is special in several dimensions, mainly due to its high physicality. Many of the connected technological concepts and domains are solely applicable within that particular environment. Also, our results indicate that a notable share of manufacturing firms did not experience any or at least not big impacts by the digital transformation on the business model level but indeed heavy impacts on the process level until now. However, for our initial suspicion that the structural differences between the manufac-turing industry and other more hardware-independent industries are so far reaching as that they would even lead to definitional differences, no evidence was found.  Conclusions: This study contributes to the ongoing line of activities trying to streamline the extensive research around the digital transformation and thereby especially emphasizes the importance of context in that area of research.","","","",""

It refers to the generation of connected, robotized, and intelligent factories. With the digital revolution, the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are shrinking to merge with new interactive modes between operators, machines, and products. Artificial intelligence, 3D printing, virtual reality, digital twin, blockchain, robotics, and digital technologies are transforming the means of production, organization, and business models of companies. If it is a more competitive technological revolution, bearer of numerous innovations, and creator of a new market dynamic, of possible reintegration of manufacturing in Western countries, Industry 4.0 disrupts the world of work as a whole. Indeed, it is the whole system of decision and political regulation of companies, communities, and states (and their natures) of the work relations on the part of the operators which is questioned with an obligation to get out of the processes of individualization and social misanthropy which are taking place at the moment. Transitions are therefore taking place with the search for a possible combination of classical aspects with the immense potential of digital technologies.","","Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things","",""

From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive).

We particularly focus on licensing of proprietary intellectual property (IP) that is embedded in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services (e.g. patented technologies). To achieve this we propose to encode the logic of license agreements into smart licenses (SL). We define a SL as a `digital twin' of a licensing contract, i.e. one or more smart contracts that represent the full or relevant parts of a licensing agreement in machine readable and executable code. As SL are self enforcing, the royalty computation and execution of payments can be fully automated in a tamper free and trustworthy way. This of course, requires to employ a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Such an Automated Licensing Payment System (ALPS) can thus automate an established business process and solve a longstanding trust issue in licensing markets. It renders traditional costly audits obsolete, lowers entry barriers for those who want to participate in licensing markets, and enables novel business models too complex with traditional approaches.","","Industries;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Distributed databases;Intellectual property;Licenses;Internet of Things;Distributed Ledger Technology;Smart Contract;License Agreement;Intellectual Property;Blockchain","",""

However, IoT-based critical infrastructures are an appealing target for cybercriminals. Such distinctive infrastructures are increasingly sensitive to cyber vulnerabilities and subject to many cyberattacks. Thus, protecting these infrastructures is a significant issue for organizations and nations. In this context, raising the cybersecurity posture of critical cyber infrastructures is an extremely urgent international issue. In addition, with the rapid development of adversarial techniques, current cyber threats have become more sophisticated, complicated, advanced and persistent. Thus, given these factors, prior to implementing efficient and resilient cybersecurity countermeasures, identification and in-depth mapping of cyber threats is an important step that is generally overlooked. Therefore, to solve cybersecurity challenges, this study presents a critical analysis of the most recent cybersecurity issues for IoT-based critical infrastructures. We then discuss potential cyber threats and cyber vulnerabilities and the main exploitation strategies adopted by cybercriminals. Further, we provide a taxonomy of cyberattacks that may affect critical cyber infrastructures.

Examples are modern road vehicles (assisted and autonomous driving), CPS road networks (car2x), power plants, smart grids and healthcare devices. However, due to the dynamic interconnection and the largely unpredictable number of possible system configurations the dependable cooperation of CPS can not be fully assured at design time. The malfunction of a CPS could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an early excerpt of an ongoing holistic approach and toolchain architecture that supports the design, development, implementation, operation and maintenance of dependable CPS. The proposed approach uses the dependability information accumulated during the system specification process as an input configuration for self-adaptive systems. These self-adaptive systems then test and assure the dependability properties of the CPS throughout the whole system life cycle.","","","",""

Therefore, this research in progress paper attempts to structure the research field and classify DTs for digital health and in future, for telemedicine. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR) and grounded theory analysis techniques, we derive 12 dimensions and 35 characteristics that support researchers and practitioners to develop, apply, refine and evaluate various DT applications. The taxonomy serves as a promising starting point for further research on implementing or adopting DTs in healthcare and telemedicine.

For this reason, NATO has issued a challenge seeking to identify ways to improve decision-maker and operator trust when deploying autonomous systems, and de-risk their adoption. This paper presents the proposal of the winning solution to this NATO challenge.

This paper proposes and tests the theoretical framework of a spatial information systems for first responders, which reflects their individual difference in information preference and helps reduce the cognitive load in line of duty. The proposed method includes the use of Virtual Reality (VR) experiments to simulate real world buildings, and the modeling of first responders’ reactions to different information formats and contents in simulated wayfinding tasks.

This study investigates a sample of 217 digital platforms running energy-related activities across the EU regional markets. These energy platforms make about 20% of the world energy platforms. By observing their characteristics and those of their surrounding markets, it appears that the digital platforms in the European energy sector still tend to be relatively small and concentrated in specific regions, often in the neighbourhood of capital cities. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis suggests that market size, digital readiness and regulatory quality are the most important features relating to platforms' presence in the EU regional markets.

The original Bitcoin protocol, called proof of work, aims to prevent malicious people from attacking the Bitcoin network by forcing them to use their computing power to prove their contributions to the network. Private protocols, such as proof of authority, are more “human centered and can achieve a much lower carbon footprint.

We explore these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly, researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate friendly society.","","Climate change, COP26, Digital world, Information management, Information systems, Information technology, Sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","",""

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.","","Sustainable logistics, Smart logistics, Port logistics, Digital technologies","",""

Digital technologies are now leading us into the fourth agricultural revolution, where sustainable food production is supported by technologies that collect data useful for farm and supply chain performance improvement, along with task automation and compliance. However, the potential benefits of digital agricultural futures are uncertain and plagued by unrealized expectations of previous innovations. The aims of this paper are to articulate current trends in technology and livestock systems and anticipate future trajectories for Agriculture 4.0 in relation to meeting sustainability and animal welfare outcomes for livestock systems. We use a ‘Futures Triangle’ approach to review the role of technology in livestock systems. The main findings are that previous work envisioning technological livestock futures have favoured pull of the future factors (techno-optimists) or weight of the past (techno-pessimists), rather than a balance of pull, push and weighting factors. Responsible Agriculture 4.0 innovation requires public–private collaboration of innovation system stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, consumers, as well as technology developers, to enable development of transition pathways from a systems perspective. The use of responsible innovation processes, including anticipation on alternative futures, should also be built into innovation processes to support critical reflection on technological trajectories and related innovation system consequences, both desirable and undesirable.","","Agriculture 4.0, Animal welfare, Digital agriculture, Futures, Livestock","",""

However, the hyper-connectivity generated by IoT networks coupled with limited default security in IoT devices increases security risks that can jeopardize the operations of cities, hospitals, and organizations. Strengthening the security aspects of IoT devices prior to their use in different systems can contribute to minimize the attack surface. This study aimed to model a sequence of seven steps to minimize the attack surface by executing hardening processes. Conducted a systematic literature review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) techniques. In this way, we were able to define a proposed methodology to evaluate the security level of an IoT solution by means of a checklist that considers the security aspects in the three layers of the IoT architecture. A risk matrix adapted to IoT is established to evaluate the attack surface. Finally, a process of hardening and vulnerability analysis is proposed to reduce the attack surface and improve the security level of the IoT solution.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Echeverra2021.pdf",""

Shorter product cycles, flexible production needs, and direct assessment of product quality attributes and raw material attributes call for an increased need of new process analytical technologies (PAT) concepts. While individual PAT tools may be available since decades, we need holistic concepts to fulfill above industrial needs. In this series of two contributions, we want to present a combined view on the future of PAT (process analytical technology), which is projected in smart labs (Part 1) and smart sensors (Part 2). Part 2 of this feature article series describes the future functionality as well as the ingredients of a smart sensor aiming to eventually fuel full PAT functionality. The smart sensor consists of (i) chemical and process information in the physical twin by smart field devices, by measuring multiple components, and is fully connected in the IIoT 4.0 environment. In addition, (ii) it includes process intelligence in the digital twin, as to being able to generate knowledge from multi-sensor and multi-dimensional data. The cyber-physical system (CPS) combines both elements mentioned above and allows the smart sensor to be self-calibrating and self-optimizing. It maintains its operation autonomously. Furthermore, it allows—as central PAT enabler—a flexible but also target-oriented predictive control strategy and efficient process development and can compensate variations of the process and raw material attributes. Future cyber-physical production systems—like smart sensors—consist of the fusion of two main pillars, the physical and the digital twins. We discuss the individual elements of both pillars, such as connectivity, and chemical analytics on the one hand as well as hybrid models and knowledge workflows on the other. Finally, we discuss its integration needs in a CPS in order to allow its versatile deployment in efficient process development and advanced optimum predictive process control.","","","",""

The Guiding Opinions puts forward “three-step goals by 2025, 2035 and the mid-twenty-first century and proposes to establish three systems—network, platform and security systems, advance two applications, i.e., integrated innovation by large enterprises and application and popularization among SMEs, and build three pillars—industrial, ecological and international—and seven tasks. Since 2018, in order to further ensure that all work is carried out effectively, turn the strategy into plans and plans into actions, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and other 22 ministries and commissions jointly developed the Action Plan for the Development of the Industrial Internet (2018–2020) in June 2018, to ensure the completion of the targets and tasks in the first stage, i.e., 2018–2020, set forth in the Guiding Opinions. Recently, guidance documents such as the Implementation Plan for the Cultivation of Industrial Internet APPs (2018–2020), the Guidelines for the Construction and Promotion of Industrial Internet Platforms, the Evaluation Methods of Industrial Internet Platforms and the Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Industrial Internet Security have been or will be introduced in succession, and specific measures have been gradually detailed, indicating that China has basically established the policy system of “top-level programme + action plan + implementation guides for the Industrial Internet [24–26].","","","",""

Advances in technology within industry 4.0 can provide acquisition of large amounts of data, to support decision making in manufacturing. Those possibilities have brought anew attention to the applicability of discrete event simulation for production flow modelling when moving towards design of logistics systems 4.0. This paper reports a study investigating challenges and opportunities for initiation of discrete event simulation, as a tool for decision making in the era of industry 4.0 manufacturing. The research has been approached through action research in combination with a real case study at a manufacturing company in the energy sector. The Covid-19 pandemic fated that adjusted and new ways of communication, collaboration, and data collection, in relation to the methods, had to be explored and tried. Throughout the study, production data, such as processing times, have been collected and analyzed for discrete event simulation modelling. The complexity of introducing discrete event simulation as a new tool for decision making is highlighted, where we emphasize the human knowledge and involvement yet necessary to understand and to draw conclusions from the data. The results also demonstrate that the data analysis has given valuable insights into production characteristics, that need addressing. Thus, revealing opportunities for how the initiative of introducing discrete event simulation as an anew tool in the wake of industry 4.0, can act as a catalyst for improved decision making in future manufacturing.","","","",""

For example, in sector such as energy or manufacturing, a maintenance activity can cause the shutdown of an entire production line, or in the case of a wind turbine inspection, may face the safety of an operator to measure a simple indicator. Hence, the application of more intelligent maintenance strategies can offer huge benefits.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate such strategies considering all necessary dimensions of the BIM system in infrastructure construction projects. The findings are based on theoretical discussion and semi-structured interviews in a case study project in New South Wales, Australia. The results revealed that BIM integrates various elements of infrastructure construction, which include but are not limited to risk, time, cost, energy, safety, and sustainability. It was found that implementation strategies should focus on improving the contribution of the BIM system to infrastructure construction in terms of improved (1) integrity and automation, (2) collaboration, and (3) optimization. Identification of seven technical and managerial implementations strategies is the core contribution of this research. These strategies provide practitioners with insight into technical and managerial measures to be taken for the successful implementation of the BIM system.","","","",""

Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernel’s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique.","","","",""

The latter are critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and could either lead to their future success or jeopardize their economic survival. To scrutinize the impact of an I4.0 solution on their processes, SMEs need to assess their trans formed processes holistically with respect to numerous perspectives. Existing assessment approaches either focus on a single I4.0 solution in isolation, assess exclusively from the technological perspective, or lack an overall procedural and economic impact evaluation. The aim of this contribution is to develop a framework of performance metrics for the holistic impact evaluation of I4.0 solutions on SMEs. In the framework, we consolidate the impacts of technology applications discussed in the literature into 16 main fields of action and define adequate performance metrics to assess each of them. The resulting performance framework combines traditional metrics for the evaluation of supply chain processes i.e., supply chain operations reference-metrics and the global reporting initiative, and extends them with additional performance metrics relevant to the assessment of I4.0 solutions. This framework aims to facilitate and systemize the selection of adequate attributes for the evaluation of I4.0 solutions. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the practical utility of the framework and its convenience for the purpose of an assessment.","","Industry 4.0, Evaluation, Technology assessment, Performance framework, Performance metrics, Small, medium-sized enterprises","",""

Like today, in PI the maritime ports will fulfil roles as continental and global hubs. Differently than ports today, however, decisions to split and bundle cargo across ships and other modes will not be made solely on the basis of long-term agreements by ports, but rather ever more dynamically and in real-time, aiming to reconsolidate shipments within the port area. This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally. We provide insights into the approach’s applicability by means of the illustrative case of Teesport, located in Northeast England (United Kingdom).","","Physical Internet, Logistics, Track-and-trace, Industry 4.0, Information architecture, Interoperability","",""

Understanding the situation and disruptive events of critical infrastructure is essential to effective disaster response and recovery of communities. The potential of social media data for situation awareness during disasters has been highlighted in recent studies. However, the application of social sensing in detecting disruptions of critical infrastructure is limited because existing approaches cannot provide complete and non-ambiguous situational information about critical infrastructure. Therefore, to address this methodological gap, we developed a graph-based approach including data filtering, burst time-frame detection, content similarity and graph analysis. A case study of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Houston was conducted to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. The findings highlighted the temporal patterns of critical infrastructure events that occurred in disasters including disruptive events and their adverse impacts on communities. The findings also provided insights for better understanding critical infrastructure interdependencies in disasters. From the practical perspective, the proposed methodology study can improve the ability of community members, first responders and decision makers to detect and respond to infrastructure disruptions in disasters.","","","",""

Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.","","Performance evaluation;Monte Carlo methods;Process control;Focusing;Hardware;Power systems;Reliability;cybersecurity;hot-patching;digital twin;real-time emulation;embedded systems;grid-connected","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Farnell2021.pdf",""

While sharing electronic health records can assist in improving diagnosis accuracy, privacy and security preservation are imperative. In the network of IoT devices, that exchange involves sensitive medical data; patient monitoring has to be totally secured against privacy risks and attacks.

Technologies, such as the Internet of Things, information communication technology, and artificial intelligence, enable more efficient functions into logistics operations. However, they also change the narrative of logistics management. Scholars in the areas of engineering, logistics, transportation, and management are attracted by this revolution. Operations management research on smart logistics mainly concerns the application of underlying technologies, business logic, operation framework, related management system, and optimization problems under specific scenarios. To explore these studies, the related literature has been systematically reviewed in this work.

The corresponding graph data model, of the involved world, supports artificial consciousness, and allows an efficient understanding of involved ecosystems and related higher-level cognitive activities. The defined cognitive architecture for Symbiotic Autonomous Systems is mainly based on the consciousness framework developed.

Therefore, the optimization of the lifecycle is increasingly important. One should not think only about the building or acquisition cost, but also about the cost through the lifecycle. The Spanish Navy (Armada) defines, on one hand, the lifecycle engineering as the set of the required activities in order to adapt the hull and the armament systems to their operational requirements, the configuration management and the definition, assessment and upgrade of the equipment support through their entire operational life. And on the other hand, the logistic support as the set of actions in order to provide the means required by their units/assets and systems to accomplish their missions. The marine industry around the warship world is immersed in the digitalization of all the logistics processes, which mainly refers to the maintenance process. In this paper we intend to reflect how the maintenance methods of the units/assets are to be based on the monitoring of equipment and how their centralized control is to be based on a detailed Maintenance Plan that would help to their preservation during their lifecycle. And also, reflect how the auxiliary marine industry, as part of the industrial technological base, may help to ease such maintenance. The methodology of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) aims to determine the operational maintenance based upon the operability of a system or equipment. This methodology, which has been adopted by the Armada, is of special importance considering the incorporation of the Center of Supervision and Data Analysis (CESADAR) to obtain the required 4.0 level.","","","",""

The entire factory is coupled with its digital twin, which is fed by an exhaustive monitoring infrastructure composed by vision systems and high precision measurement instruments, allowing to track in real time plant processes. The design has been carried out in order to make the smart factory serving as a mean to face both educational and research challenges at many different levels. As an educational mean, students and professionals have the chance to dive into manufacturing history experiencing both classical automation topics (PLC, MES and SCADA programming, precision axes control and pneumatics), as well as more advanced technologies, typical of the most advanced smart-factories (IoT, vision systems, simulation and digital twin, advanced measuring methods and smart production management systems).

The hull was damaged, and passengers, crew, and ships were rescued due to extremely good weather conditions and courageous on-scene commanders. For both accidents, had the navigators on board received information in time, they would have been able to choose another and safer route, and the accidents could have been avoided.  From the Titanic days up to now, the ICT maturity has grown rapidly.

In parallel with the development, we must ensure that the human interactions will be taken care of. Therefore, the introduction of new technology should include the “human in the loop, the user aspects, and must have focus on the integration between Man, Technology, and Organization (MTO).  In this chapter we will describe some of the central ICT solutions used for sustainable shipping and the way they are operated and give examples on existing and future trends that influence sustainability where the ICT’s role in the process is elaborated.","","","",""

Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the ideal case of a ``digital twin″. The modeling of the ground goes beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major international projects clearly show that the optimization of construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the introduction of an infrastructure information model, which contains the three submodels ground, building and construction site.

We decompose the Optimal Power Flow problem using a blockchain-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and we comment on efficiency, trust, security and transparency issues. The successive iterants of the solution of the power flow problem are securely stored on the blockchain, removing the need for a central operating authority, while allowing network nodes to verify the validity and optimality of the solution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm presented through simulation experiments on the 39-bus New England transmission system, and IEEE-57 and IEEE-118 benchmark systems. We systematically compare the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with well established blockchain consensus algorithms. The results show that our method maintains the convergence characteristics of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers iterative scheme and enables independent network nodes to reach consensus.","","Distributed consensus, Blockchain, Optimal Power Flow, Power systems, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers","",""

In the meantime, the 4th industrial revolution, characterized by several technologies that allow digitalisation, optimisation, automation, customisation and more communication, is in progress. Thus, the ‘Industry 4.0’ can be an enabler for industrial sustainable development. Maintenance processes, which are fundamental for ensuring sustainable operation of manufacturing systems, can benefit from these technologies, with a consequent improvement of maintenance and manufacturing performance. Therefore, a strong synergy between I4.0 technologies and industrial maintenance processes for promoting sustainable manufacturing occurs. Nevertheless, to date, no study investigates thoroughly the effects of such potential synergy on sustainable manufacturing. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, identifying the relation between maintenance processes and I4.0 technologies; then, analysing the positive effects of their integration on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable manufacturing. Finally, a preliminary analysis was also conducted to shed light on the negative effects of this synergy on sustainability.","","Digital Factory, Industry 4.0, I4.0 technologies, smart factory, smart maintenance, sustainable maintenance, sustainable manufacturing","",""

As industries need to respond to evolving trends quickly, as well professionals need to be able to work and constantly learning in this new work environment. Besides, due to the continuous advances in technology and the adoption of these technologies in the industries processes, the level of complexity in the workplace is increasing, which results in the need for a new professional role. However, the main challenge is how to prepare and qualify these professionals to acquire these competences. In order to provide a better understanding of the new professional role and their relationship with the industry 4.0 working environment, this paper introduces an ontology for Competence Management in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Considering the recent scientific and business developments for preparing the industries and workers for this new working era, competences and skills needed for professionals in industry 4.0 were reviewed, as well as challenges and opportunities. Based on a systematic literature review in scientific sources and grey literature, this work identified what technologies are being adopted and what the professional competences are for working in this working environment. Since Industry 4.0 is spreading all over the world, this study contributes to this understanding and also provides a starting point for further research regarding workforce competence management for Industry 4.0.","","","",""

These concepts are validated by performing novelty detection on open access UAV flight data with GPS spoofing attacks, which represents a typical system use-case. Multiple machine learning models are trained to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting modern cyber-intrusions and anomalies using the digital-twin architecture.

Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.","","Protocols;Cloud computing;Industries;Digital twin;Standards;Computer security;Solid modeling;Engineering education;industry 4.0;industrial Internet of Things;IIoT;cyber-physical system","",""

Digitalization’s technological advantages can be achieved through data-driven strategies and wherein cognitive services are integrated into IoT (Internet of Things) and big data. We experiment with the Industrial IoT (IIoT) business models and value propositions to match the intelligent insights of cognitive solutions to business objectives. The IIoTs support and demand transparency and thus also data-driven objective insights, and because cognitive solutions can enhance insights on a product, a process or service and therefore provide measurable business objectives.

To realize these potential benefits of continuous operations, effectively managing materials, equipment, analyzers, and data is vital. Developments for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing have led to novel technologies and methods for processing material, designing and configuring individual equipment and process analyzers, as well as implementing strategies for active process control. However, limited work has been reported on managing abnormal conditions during operations to prevent unplanned deviations and downtime and sustain system capabilities. Moreover, although the sourcing, analysis, and management of real-time data have received growing attention, limited discussion exists on the continued verification of the infrastructure for ensuring reliable operations. Hence, this work introduces condition-based maintenance (CBM) as a general strategy for continually verifying and sustaining advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing systems, with a focus on the continuous manufacture of oral solid drug products (OSD-CM). Frameworks, such as CBM, benefit unified efforts towards continued verification and operational excellence by leveraging process knowledge and the availability of real-time data. A vital implementation consideration for manufacturing operations management applications, such as CBM, is a systems architecture and an enabling infrastructure. This work outlines the systems architecture design for CBM in OSD-CM and highlights sample fault scenarios involving equipment and process analyzers. For illustrative purposes, this work also describes the infrastructure implemented on an OSD-CM testbed, which uses commercially available automation systems and leverages enterprise architecture standards. With the increasing digitalization of manufacturing operations in the pharmaceutical industry, proactively using process data towards modernizing maintenance practices is relevant to a single unit operation as well as to a series of physically integrated unit operations.","","Continuous manufacturing, Oral solid dose, Manufacturing operations management, Process monitoring, Maintenance, Continued process verification, Systems integration","",""

However, these offerings seldom enhance revenue, because companies struggle with business model (BM) dynamics. By analyzing 27 companies through an explorative case-study approach, the authors consider how companies can successfully achieve revenue enhancement through digital offerings. The result is a threefold framework for revenue enhancement through digital offerings. First, this framework distinguishes between three phases of BM dynamics: 1) augmenting products through a “hardware plus logic, 2) developing a portfolio of multiple logics for creating customer value, 3) integrating this portfolio through platform logic. Second, the framework emphasizes that three barriers, which we refer to as confidence, mixing, and collaboration barrier, limit the progress from Phases 1 to 3. Third, the framework reveals that each phase contains certain modifications of BM components. In the first phase, companies adapt their BM components slightly, so as to advance toward a “hardware plus logic. In the second phase, companies embrace more radical BM innovations in order to convert services into an outcome-based BM and develop a new software subscription BM. In the third phase, companies modify BM components in order to integrate the BMs internally and to open them up for external collaboration partners.","","Digitalization, Digital offerings, Business models, Business model innovations, Competitive advantages, Business model components, Revenue enhancement, Value creation","",""

Many of these aspects also ensure and improve functional safety, privacy, and security in process execution. However, managed business processes lack flexibility; ie, changing a business process requires more effort than ad hoc execution and adaptation. Thus, especially in small companies, the acceptance rate of managed business processes is low. So we claim that in current BPM approaches, the structuredness ensuring functional safety and security concepts contradicts with the objective for flexibility. The main goal of the AdaBPM project is to address this contradiction by providing a formal approach to handle advanced adaptations and exception handling in business processes. The technical objectives of the project include (1) the definition of a basic framework being capable of handling different levels of adaptivity and considering security and safety requirements at the same time, (2) a rigorous process specification language and model refinement methods, (3) static business process adaptations, and (4) dynamic (or ad hoc) adaptations. The result of our research is a general approach for flexible BPM combined with the possibility to nevertheless manage the process and define safety and security restrictions.","","business process management, exception handling, fault tolerance, formal semantics, process adaptations, safety and security restrictions","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Geist2018.pdf",""

In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. ‘Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement’ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders – leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians – to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.","","Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing, Digitization, Sustainability, Environmentalism, Industrial internet","",""

The interpretive structural modeling technique is further used for mapping the interrelationships among various energy sustainability functions identified. The interpretive model developed, and the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement analysis offered exciting insights into the Industry 4.0-energy sustainability interactions. Findings show that Industry 4.0 promotes energy sustainability via a very complex mechanism that involves ten interrelated functions. Contrary to the general opinion, production efficiency offered by the digitalization of the manufacturing industry is not the immediate and most essential energy efficiency outcome of the digital industrial transformation. Industry 4.0 primarily contributes to energy sustainability by enabling the energy industry to reshape its operating landscape and enjoy more advanced, intelligent, and complicated energy production and distribution equipment. The digitalization of the energy demand sector, digitalization of the manufacturing industry, and the introduction of smarter and more sustainable products are among the main opportunities of Industry 4.0 for energy sustainability. Overall, the study and the ISM model of energy sustainability developed explains how Industry 4.0 contributes to energy sustainability via different functions and how each function is placed within the structural model based on its driving and dependence powers.","","","",""

This unprecedented growth calls for a systematic review of the concept, scope, definition, and functionality of Industry 4.0. Such systematic review should address the existing ambiguities and deliver a clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of this phenomenon, including the possible implications for sustainability. Consistently, the present study carried out a systematic literature review of related articles, published online within the Industry 4.0 discipline until November 2020. The systematic literature review identified 745 eligible articles and applied extensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis methodically. The study provides a descriptive assessment of eligible articles’ properties and offers a unified conceptualization of Industry 4.0 and the underlying building blocks. The study explains how the implications of Industry 4.0 for value creation expand beyond the manufacturing industry. The study further describes the sustainability value drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and identifies the conditions on which digital industrial transformation success lays. Overall, findings reveal that Industry 4.0 transformation could address pressing issues of sustainable development goals, particularly concerning the manufacturing-economic development. The study also draws on the findings and offers important theoretical and practical implications, highlights the existing gaps within the literature, and discusses the possible future research directions.","","Industry 4.0, Digitalization, Sustainability, Digital transformation, Systematic review, Sustainable development","",""

For this, a special type of twin denoted as sensor signal-based twin must be constructed and adapted into the cyber-physical systems. The twin must (1) machine-learn the required knowledge from the historical sensor signal datasets, (2) seamlessly interact with the real-time sensor signals, (3) handle the semantically annotated datasets stored in clouds, and (4) accommodate the data transmission delay. The development of such twins has not yet been studied in detail. This study fills this gap by addressing sensor signal-based digital twin development for intelligent machine tools. Two computerized systems denoted as Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS) are proposed to construct and adapt the twin, respectively. The modular architectures of the proposed DTCS and DTAS are presented in detail. The real-time responses and delay-related computational arrangements are also elucidated for both systems. The systems are also developed using a Java™-based platform. Milling torque signals are used as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of DTCS and DTAS.

Ontologies play an important role in SOCx as they facilitate data readability and reasoning by machines. A better understanding of ontologies is required in order to develop and incorporate them in SOCx. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art research on building data ontologies since 2014 within the SOCx domain through sorting them based on building data types, general approaches, and applications. The data types of two main domains of building information modeling and building management system have been considered in the majority of existing ontologies. Three main applications are evident from a critical analysis of existing ontologies: (1) key performance indicator calculation, (2) building performance improvement, and (3) fault detection and diagnosis. The key gaps found in the literature review are a holistic ontology for SOCx and insight on how such approaches should be evaluated. Based on these findings, this study provides recommendations for future necessary research including: identification of SOCx-related data types, assessment of ontology performance, and creation of open-source approaches.","","Building management system, Building information model, Data structure, Key performance indicator, Performance improvement, Fault detection and diagnosis","",""

In the general population, approximately 3–8% of patients are reported to experience a sulfonamide allergy. Sulfonamide allergies can result in various physical manifestations; however, rash is reported as the most frequently observed. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dermatologic reactions to sulfonamide antimicrobial agents occur 10 to 20 times more frequently compared to immunocompetent patients. This article describes the incidence, manifestations, and risk factors associated with sulfonamide allergies. The potential for cross-reactivity of allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials with nonantimicrobial sulfonamide medications is also reviewed. Data suggest that substitutions at the N1 and N4 positions are the primary determinants of drug allergy instead of the common sulfonamide moiety. For patients with an indication for a sulfonamide antimicrobial with a listed allergy, it is important for healthcare practitioners to adequately assess the allergic reaction to determine appropriate management. Rechallenge and desensitization strategies may be appropriate for patients with delayed maculopapular eruptions, while alternative treatment options may be prudent for more severe reactions. Available data suggests a low risk of cross-allergenicity between sulfonamide antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial agents.","","","",""

However, human domain experts often have difficulty describing their decision-making processes. We propose a new approach for capturing this decision-making process through counterfactual reasoning in pairwise comparisons. Our approach is model-free and does not require iterating through the state space. We demonstrate that this approach accurately learns multifaceted heuristics on a synthetic and real world data sets. We also demonstrate that policies learned from human scheduling demonstration via apprenticeship learning can substantially improve the efficiency of schedule optimization. We employ this human-machine collaborative optimization technique on a variant of the weapon-to-target assignment problem. We demonstrate that this technique generates optimal solutions up to 9.5 times faster than a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm.&#x0D;&#x0D;&#x0D;","","","",""

Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings. In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges. To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation. To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.","","","",""

Going beyond simply the automation of manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 involves the convergence of information and automation technology to create cyber-physical systems which virtualize and optimise the manufacturing process on a global scale. The traditional unidisciplinary or multidisciplinary engineering approach has been extremely successful for the provision of Mechatronics Engineers for Industry 3.0 over the past decades. But the complexities of the cyber physical systems which must be implemented as part of Industry 4.0 require a much more comprehensive systems engineering approach. This has resulted in the requirement for the new occupation of Equipment Systems Engineers (ESE) who have been introduced to, and are capable of utilizing an interdisciplinary or even anti-disciplinary approach. This paper describes the development and implementation of an Industry-Led Masters programme at the University of Limerick which was designed specifically to meet the unique skillset required for this rapidly developing field. The development of a unique Industry 4.0 teaching space is described as well as the creation of three manufacturing cells and their ‘digital twins’ which recreate the environment found in the field. They allow Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies to be used to interact remotely with the equipment. Close collaboration with Industry Experts is a strong feature of the design and delivery of the programme. The teaching methods were also novel and an implementation of the CDIO method is described. The programme recently received the award of ‘Best New Masters Programme’ in a field of competitors across all Irish Universities and disciplines.","","Smart |Manufacture, Factories of the Future, Industry 4.0, Mechatronics","",""

IoT is considered as fourth industrial revolution. General Electric (GE) predicts that $1.3 trillion of value can be captured in the electricity value chain from 2016 to 2025 by IoT. SCADA, PLC, smart meters and smart devices are few old examples of IoT. What is new that would create so much value in power sector is deployment of smart devices, advance analytics, advance dash board, cloud computing and the integration of several services into a common platform due to drastic reduction in prices of Wi-Fi chipsets and availability of variety of sensors like accelerometers, cameras, tactile, sound, temperatures and others. The three global digital themes for electricity industry from generation to consumption are; (1) Asset Management, (2) Operation Optimization, and (3) Enhanced Customer Services. The Indian power sector is facing several challenges such as high AT&C losses, poor reliability, public and political demand to keep tariff low, integration of high RE capacity into the grid and aging infrastructure. IoT can support resolution of most. This paper will attempt to identify, IoT applications for India power sector, Challenges and way forward.","","","",""

Major innovations of the revised VDI guideline 2206 for developing mechatronic systems are systems thinking as a core element and six checkpoints for structuring deliverables along the V-Model. These checkpoints serve for orientation in result progress and thus enable a structured and complete development process. However, tasks and checkpoints of the new guideline focus on the product development itself without integrating the development of related CPPS, enabling optimization simultaneously to system development. Implications are derived by a three-step analysis. The paper at hand contributes fundamental extensions of the checkpoint questions regarding integrated CPPS development. These questions provide methodical support for system developers of CPPS for CPS by enabling the project manager to check the status, schedule further development steps and evaluate the maturity of the whole, integrated development.","","Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS), V-Model, Product System Development, Integrated Development, VDI 2206","",""

Smart manufacturing operations planning and control program, as defined by NIST, implement advances in measurement science that enable performance, quality, interoperability, wireless and cybersecurity standards for real-time prognostics and health monitoring, control, and optimization of smart manufacturing systems.  The traditional production processes and plants are evolving following this digitalization combining the long experience and the AI-driven methods to improve the production efficiency, to accelerate the fine-tuning and real-time adjustment of the process parameters oriented to the zero defect quality. The digitalization of multi-stages production processes (e.g. foundry) plays a key role in competitiveness introducing new integrated platform to monitor the process through an intelligent sensors network and predict quality and cost of castings in real-time.  The application presented in this paper is the main outcome of EU FP7-MUSIC project giving a new age to the traditional multi-stages production. The actual regional project PreMANI (POR FESR 2014–2020) is a new extended application of AI-driven digital twin in manufacturing process and quality control.

In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.","","PaaS, simulation environment, drones, digital twin","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Grigoropoulos2020.pdf",""

In particular, human-robot collaboration in assembly will be particularly interesting for manufacturing companies. In this context, the interaction between humans and robots opens new possibilities but also challenges. A major problem is related to safety: unwanted and unexpected contacts between the human and the robotic system may cause injuries and therefore limit the potential for collaboration. Nowadays, there is a lack of simple and practical tools for helping system designers in overcoming such limiting conditions. In this work, guidelines for the design of safe human-robot collaborative assembly are developed and classified, particularly focusing on the features characterizing the entire system. These are validated by means of a laboratory case study and a digital twin. The validation process is based on the assumption that a team of manufacturing engineers (not-experts in occupational health and safety) should be able to autonomously and gradually apply the given guidelines reducing the mechanical risk in a collaborative assembly system. The proposed solutions have been virtually modelled allowing the evaluation of their effectiveness. According to the results, the proposed guidelines effectively help non-expert users in the development and improvement of collaborative assembly systems from the safety perspective.","","Collaborative robotics, Human-robot collaboration, Human-robot interaction, Safety, Digital twin industry 4.0","",""

A key technology behind this opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge through an informed and intelligent robotized automation is the robotic digital twin (RDT). As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This paper contributes to addressing this gap. We introduce a novel concept for the development of a RDT that helps create and add value to current and future robotized cyber-physical applications. Hereinafter referred to as the value-driven RDT (vdRDT), it systematically captures the robot dynamics and purposefully farms data, about which its services reason to facilitate insight and deliver capabilities and benefits to stakeholders. Experiment results show that vdRDTs enlarge the scope of, adapt to, and revitalize robotized applications carried out in different fields.&lt;/div&gt;","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Guiffo2020.pdf",""

To achieve this, we follow a two-stage review methodology. Firstly, we review several academic databases and discuss the impact and application domain of a number of selected papers. Secondly, we perform a direct Google Scholar search and present numerical results on global trends for the related technologies between years 2011 and 2018. Our reviews show that simulation is in the heart of most of the technologies Industry 4.0 utilises or provides. Simulation has significant role in Industry 4.0 in terms of supporting development and deployment of its technologies such as Cyber-Physical System (CPS), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Smart Factory, Digital Twin, and Internet of Things (IoT).

Additionally, work safety issues are more important than it was in the past with the emergence of autonomous machines in manufacturing. The data will help create smartness and intelligence in manufacturing and simulation help data analytics in comprehension and knowledge extraction. This chapter is the concluding chapter of this book and summarizes the role of simulation in Industry 4.0. There are explicit and implicit imposed roles of simulation which are summarized in terms of technologies composed of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and smart factory.

Industry 4.0, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, comprises of advanced technologies such as robotics, autonomous transportation and production machinery, additive manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT), 5G mobile communication, sensors, systems integration, Cloud, big data, data analytics, and simulation. Such technologies are used in the production of quality goods, which increased product diversity, and often at lower costs achieved through optimisation and smart production techniques. The goals of Industry 4.0 are to achieve Smart Factories and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The introductory chapter presents concepts from Industry 4.0 and contextualises the role of simulation in bringing about this new industrial age. The history of the industrial revolutions and simulation are discussed. Major concepts in Industry 4.0, such as CPS, vertical and horizontal system integration, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Cloud, big data, data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and additive manufacturing are evaluated in the context of simulation. The discussions show that computer simulation is intrinsic to several of these Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies, for example, the application of simulation in hybrid modelling (e.g., digital twins), simulation-based training, data analytics (e.g., prescriptive analytics through the use of computer simulation), designing connectivity (e.g., network simulation), and simulation-based product design.

In the traditional cloud manufacturing model, the direct access of manufacturing equipment to the cloud brings huge network pressure and unbearable latency, and also poses a privacy and security risk. Aiming at the cloudification of manufacturing equipment in the cloud manufacturing environment, the 3D printer is selected as the research object, and a cloud-edge collaboration architecture for 3D printers based on digital twin is proposed. To solve the lack of network reliability brought about by traditional cloudification, time-sensitive services are deployed at the edge, realizing the local extension of cloud services. The digital twin information model of FDM additive manufacturing is defined. Real time controlling and monitoring based on digital twin is realized. By cloud-edge collaboration, an application case is implemented, which verifies the effectiveness of the system and provides a reference solution for the cloudification of other manufacturing equipment in the environment of cloud manufacturing.","","Cloud computing;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Digital twin;Collaboration;Three-dimensional printing;Real-time systems;cloud manufacturing;digital twin;cloud-edge collaboration;additive manufacturing","",""

These methods offer the freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain (\textlessitalic\textgreaterdigital thread\textless/italic\textgreater) with the physical supply chain and their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further, we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Gupta2020.pdf",""

One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.","","Information fusion, Information quality, Information imperfections, Sustainability","",""

These technologies have brought clear benefits over traditional systems, such as easy management, universal availability, and decreased hardware requirements for end-user devices. The main challenges of the first-generation IoT services are related to communication latency due to high physical and logical distance between end nodes and server resources and vulnerability for network problems along the long routes. Thanks to the unveiling of the fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) for cellular networks, the last-mile connection performance – communication latency in particular – is taking a huge leap and therefore introducing new possibilities for industrial applications. Edge computing is a key technology to unleash the full potential of the arising industrial wireless communication, since it enables deploying computational tasks to computing nodes near the end devices and therefore opens novel business opportunities around real-time cloud services. In this chapter, we introduce the current state of the art and discuss different challenges the edge computing systems are facing particularly in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) domain, as well as present potential solutions for the identified challenges.","","","",""

However, this becomes increasingly speculative as one moves to more distant timelines and visionary technological forms. This raises the question of whether it is possible to rationally predict how a technology development trajectory might unfold into the future, perhaps to some ‘ultimate form’, that is accessible, surfaces the necessary technological features for development as well as considers the implications for human–artefact relationships. The proposed approach is conceptually grounded in a parsimonious framework that examines different configurations of human–artefact relationships, revealing ‘Six Genres of Technology’. This suggests how the shift from human-human to artefact-artefact and the increasing autonomy of the artefacts (technological beings), introduces specific features to each of the six Genres. Four features are identified in the later Genres that in combination, could be construed as, or indeed pose a threat: autonomy, intelligence, language, and autopoiesis. This paper advances the debate about future technological developments by using the proposed framework to structure an argument about the key issues that should be discussed today - so that the developments of tomorrow can be more reflectively considered, appropriately debated and knowingly pursued.","","Futures, Digital technology, Digital transformation, Social impact, Autonomous technology, Artificial intelligence","",""

This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.","","Cybermanufacturing, Blockchain, Smart contracts, Distributed digital thread, Cloud manufacturing","",""

In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem.","","blockchain, smart contracts, distributed database, time series, regression, lstm, gas price prediction","",""

Several users are not aware of the underlying threats and most of them do not possess the knowledge to set and operate the various digital assets securely. Therefore, cyber security training is becoming mandatory both for simple users and security experts. Cyber ranges constitute an advance training technique where trainees gain hands-on experiences on a safe virtual environment, which can be a realistic digital twin of an actual system. This paper presents the cyber ranges platform THREAT-ARREST. Its design is fully model-driven and offers all modern training features (i.e. emulation, simulation, serious games, and fabricated data).

Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.","","","",""

Where tokenization may disrupt our economic system leading to more efficiency or democracy, it is required to gain insights and facilitate the development of use cases associated with this concept. To illustrate how firms can apply tokenization to innovate their businesses, we propose a framework of different token properties, drivers, and barriers for adoption based on literature and expert interviews and present eight archetypical cases derived from an analysis of 129 ventures.

The key idea of the projected approach is to first combine two digital watermark images into a single fused watermark to increase the embedded information payload. Then, the fused watermark is scrambled using Arnold and Chaotic algorithms. Finally, the scrambled fused watermark is embedded in the cover image using the SVD and three-level DWT algorithms. The selection of the Arnold and chaotic for watermark encryption is attributed to confirm robustness which resists several types of multimedia attacks and upturn the security level. This paper also presents a comparative study of the proposed approach for different digital images to determine its robustness and stability. Several simulation results reveal that the proposed system improves the capacity and security of embedded medical watermarks without affecting the cover image quality.

However, to accomplish this, manufacturers must overcome several barriers, such as the lack of qualified talent to develop and manage various high-tech systems. This deficiency means that Industry 4.0 demands a change in the labor market, explicitly requiring trained professionals who have the competencies and skills to thrive in this new environment.

However, there is a steady need for more robust operation, where robots should perform complex tasks by reliably exploiting these novel capabilities. Mission-level resilience is required in the presence of component faults through failure recovery. To address this challenge, a novel self-adaptation framework based on functional knowledge for augmented autonomy is presented. A metacontroller is integrated on top of the robot control system, and it uses an explicit run-time model of the robot’s controller and its mission to adapt to operational changes. The model is grounded on a functional ontology that relates the robot’s mission with the robot’s architecture, and it is generated during the robot’s development from its engineering models. Advantages are discussed from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. An application example in a real autonomous mobile robot is provided. In this example, the generic metacontroller uses the robot’s functional model to adapt the control architecture to recover from a sensor failure.","","","",""

In the context of the Industry 4.0 initiative, Cyber-Physical ProductionSystems (CPPS) or Cyber Manufacturing Systems (CMS) can be characterized asadvanced networked mechatronic production systems gaining their added valueby interaction with the ambient Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In thiscontext appropriate communication technologies and standards play a vitalrole to realize the manifold potential improvements in the productionprocess. One of these standards is IO-Link. In 2016 more than 5 millionIO-Link nodes have been produced and delivered, still gaining increasingacceptance for the communication between sensors, actuators and the controllevel. The steadily increasing demand for more flexibility in automationsolutions can be fulfilled using wireless technologies. With the wirelessextension for the IO-Link standard, which will be presented in this article,maximum cycle times of 5 ms can be achieved with a probability that this limitwill be exceeded to be at maximum one part per billion. Also roaming capabilities, wirelesscoexistence mechanisms and the possibility to include battery-powered orenergy-harvesting sensors with very limited energy resources in the realtimenetwork were defined. For system planning, setup, operation and maintenance,the standard engineering tools of IO-Link can be employed so that thebackward compatibility with wired IO-Link solutions can be guaranteed.Interoperability between manufacturers is a key requirement for anycommunication standard, thus a procedure for IO-Link Wireless testing is alsosuggested.","","","",""

Traceability and trackability of data ensure the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part’s life cycle, leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.","","Blockchain, Hyperledger, Aviation, Aircraft spare parts, Inventory management, Digital twin, Traceability, Trackability","",""

A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions.Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results. Our findings highlight areas for future research and provide suggestions for investigation approaches.","","CPS, security, architecture, industry 4.0","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Hofer2018.pdf",""

Dynamic environments, full of uncertainties, complexities, and ambiguities, demand faster and more confident decisions. To compete in this environment, Industry 4.0 emerges as an essential alternative. In this context, the reliability of manufacturing is an essential aspect for companies to make successful decisions. In the literature, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been applied to improve the availability of equipment, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), blockchain, and data mining. Nevertheless, there is still no survey study that seeks to show how reliability has collaborated to support decision-making in organizations, in the context of Industry 4.0. In general, most applications still focus on the productivity and health of individual equipment. However, in today's volatile and complex businesses, local decisions are no longer sufficient; it is necessary to analyze the organization entirely. Thus, being aware of the impacts that a local failure can impose on the entire company has significant weight in the decision-making process. In this context, this article presents a survey to identify how researches on systems reliability has contributed to and supported the development of decision-making in Industry 4.0. The main contribution of this article is to highlight how reliability can be used to support different types of strategic decisions in the context of Industry 4.0. Finally, it highlights the need for research associating management decisions with the technologies of Industry 4.0.","","Industry 4.0, Decision-making, Reliability, Types of integrations, Systematic review","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Hoffmann2020.pdf",""

To overcome this tension field, we propose a set of 16 requirements for the development of industrial AI solutions to foster i) the adaptation process, ii) support the solution engineering and iii) ease the embedding into the existing system landscape while respecting iv) safety aspects to build up v) trust into industrial AI solutions. The proposed requirements can guide industrial stakeholders to focus on the right solution approach for specific production challenges and support them in voicing their own needs towards novel AI solutions. This will help AI developers to speed up time-to-market as well as to increase market acceptance of industrial AI solutions. Overall, specifying requirements on industrial AI will foster the acceptance and utilization rates of AI solutions in industrial practice.","","","",""

The business model of those platforms introduces transaction costs for users. Additionally, these platforms often create lasting dependencies, lack transparency, and therefore trust. At the same time, new technologies such as blockchain emerged, which promise to solve these various issues by enabling decentralized transactions. This paper uses a design science research approach to develop an infrastructure for decentralized collaborative manufacturing. Therefore, we matched requirements for existing platform approaches to decentralizing technologies.

Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration.

Not surprisingly, our results show that DIUs primarily focus on digital products and business models related to AI, IoT/Smart x and Data Analytics. Differentiating between four DIU setups, we could not find particular digital trends being addressed by specific setups. In addition, drawing on the Gartner Hype Cycle (GHC), we show that DIUs mostly pay attention to digital trends in more mature stages.

The architecture of the system is fully based on open source software and protocols. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the system architecture, we implemented and validated it using SITL (software in the loop) simulator. Experimental results show that the system is efficient in monitoring and controlling UAV remotely through the Internet.","","SITL simulator, Unmanned aerial vehicle, Cloud platform, Control system architecture","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Hong2018.pdf",""

The implementation of industrial IoT devices into production streamlines the production process and reduces production costs. On the other hand, connected IoT devices bring new security risks to production and expose an industrial environment to new types of attacks. The article analyzes the vulnerability of the production line with implemented industrial IoT devices with consideration of a possible Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attack led by attackers from the internet. Various types of DDoS attacks abusing the presence of IoT devices in the system were performed on an automated production line implementing sorting, preparation, and dosing of bulk and liquid materials for filling into containers. The leading attacks caused failure of the production line during the production, as well as the dysfunction of communication with IoT devices. The article also demonstrates the implementation of countermeasures against DDoS attacks and possible strategies to protect and mitigate such attacks on the production line.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Horak2021.pdf",""

In this paper, a self-security approach is implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. The digital twin is formed using the inverter’s normal operating region and the inverter’s dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates how the inverter’s normal operating region and dynamic model are formed. In particular, the normal operation region is experimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 1.5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter and a 12-kW NHR 9410 regenerative power grid emulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique can potentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks by examining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter’s digital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.","","Flowcharts;Digital twin;Heuristic algorithms;Power system dynamics;Voltage;Inverters;Real-time systems;Smart inverters;cyber-physical devices;self-security;reference model;digital twin","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Hossen2021.pdf",""

The new energy minister was involved in setting current output OPEC-plus targets, and will be under pressure to seek further cuts. The choice of Yasir al-Rumayyan, an investment adviser to the crown prince, as Aramco chairman is a signal of commitment to pursue the IPO.

Often linked to the smart city movement, it provides a way of sensing and collecting data—environmental, societal, and transitional—both automatically, remotely, and with increasing levels of spatial and temporal detail. From city-wide data collection down to the scale of individual buildings and rooms, this chapter details the technology behind the rise of IoT in urban areas and explores the challenges (societal and technical) behind city-wide deployments. Drawing from a series of deployments at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, it details the challenges and opportunities for mass data collection. Widening out the view, it looks at what is becoming known as “the humble lamp post in Urban IoT fields to detail the potential of Urban IoT with the objects that already form part of the urban fabric. Finally, it examines the potential of Urban IoT for input into urban modeling and how we are on the edge of a shift in the collection, analysis, and communication of urban data.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\HudsonSmith2021.pdf",""

The fundamental threat to this progress is the inherent increase of complexity through heterogeneous systems, software, and hardware that leads to fragility and unreliability. Systems cannot only become more unreliable, modern industrial control systems also have to face hostile security attacks that take advantage of unintended vulnerabilities overseen during development and deployment. Self-adaptive software systems offer means of dealing with complexity by observing systems externally. In this chapter the authors present their ongoing research on an approach that applies a self-adaptive software system in order to increase the reliability and security of control devices for hydro-power plant units. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by two use cases. Further, the chapter gives an introduction to the field of self-adaptive software systems and raises research challenges in the context of cyber-physical systems.","","","",""

By 2020 the data generated per second for every human being will approximate amount to 1.7 megabytes and the volume of data would double every 2 years thus reach the 40 ZB point by 2020. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by the end of year 2020, the e-commerce transactions B2B and B2C will hit 450 billion per day on the internet. The advent of Big and real time Data has triggered disruptive changes in many fields and the exploding volume of different sources of data like heterogeneous data, data integration, spatio-temporal correlation of data, batch analytics and real-time analytics, data sharing, semantic interoperability requires the development of a scalable platform that can fuse multiple data layers to handles the data intelligently. In Big Data approaches, the challenge is not anymore to collect the data, but to draw valuable conclusions by properly analyzing them. The growth in Unstructured Data generated by business is irrefutable and they are under more pressure to preserve it for longer periods of time. To be clear, exploiting the collected data has been always considered by practitioners and researchers, but the huge velocity, heterogeneity and enormity of massive stream of real-time data shove the limits of the current storage, management and processing capabilities. Admittedly, the traditional method of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) are challenged and cannot be applied on the emerging opportunistically and crowed sensed data streams. Some of these data streams are structured in a way that serve only one predefined purpose and cannot be directly used for other means. Yet, there are emerging unstructured data such as context-based data from the internet and social media as well as credit card transactions that is not clear if they can be used to better understand the mobility patterns. The analytical company Gartner states that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion interconnected devices. It is obvious, that they will produce massive amounts of meaningful data. Those data can be used for many applications such as real-time industrial equipment monitoring, traffic planning, automated maintenance, etc. Therefore, it is essential to develop modern system abstractions that allow us to resourcefully process huge and new data streams. This enormous amount of data urges the growth of integrated and insightful big and real-time data analytics Platforms. The upcoming contemporary technology like digital twin, integrates historical data from past machine usage to the current data. It uses sensors to collect the real-time data, working status and other operational data attached to the physical model. These components send the relevant data via a cloud-based system to the other side of the bridge with the help of data analytics platform which produces the required insights. The big and real-time data analytics Platforms assist to perform useful operations on data analytics as a complete package. For this purpose, data analytics platform are used to acquire constructive insight from the huge volume of data. Data analytics platform is an ecosystem of technologies and services that can help the businesses in increasing revenues, enhance operational efficiency, stabilize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts, respondmore quickly toemerging market trends and gain a competitive edge over rivals. The data analytics platform finds the pattern and relationships in data by applying statistical techniques and communicates the results generated by analytical models to executives and end users to make decisions with the help of data visualization tools that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real time as new information becomes available. Big data and real-time data analytics platform supports the full spectrum of data types, protocols and integration to speed up and simplify the data wrangling process. The big data and real time platform provides accurate data, increase efficiency in the workspace, gives answers to complex questions along with security and hence it plays the key role in business analytics.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Indrakumari2020.pdf",""

It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.","","Ports, Digitalization, Scenarios, Information technologies, Transport, Management","",""

An essential characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.","","emergent behavior, Systems-of-Systems, Systematic mapping study","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Inocncio2019.pdf",""

However, the design of structural members for buildings might need to address temporary dynamic loads due to wind, earthquake or other factors depending on building or structure height and application. In contrast, pavements are subjected to the moving loads of vehicles as well as to further loads due to temperature gradients. Since the layers of various materials used in pavements may vary in thickness and the statically indeterminate nature of pavement (due to the full contact with the bed soil layer or the lower layers), any deformation caused by changes in the moisture content and temperature can result in internal stresses in pavement structures. Consequently, analysis of pavement structures can be very complicated, requiring skills in material characterization, mathematics and modeling. In this regard, a useful book that covers various subjects in the pavement design and analysis was reviewed. Th details of each chapter were briefly explained. This book is recommended for consultant engineers and pavement researchers.","","","",""

The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development. The observed trends show that formal models and ontologies will play an even more essential role in I4.0 systems as interoperability becomes more of a focus and that the new generation of linkable data sources should be based on semantically enriched information.

IIoT connects the actors, and the physical and cyber resources of industrial systems, manufacturing- or service-based, in a cloud-enabled overall data exchange system. This work outlines a formal model for operational scheduling of cyber-physical resources for different scenarios determined by resource and logistics availability and cost. Information exchange of physical work-in-process, resource failures, alternative resource options, order and logistics information, are used to deliver real-time scheduling to IIoT participants. The model is formalized using discrete state-machine diagrams for resource reliability and availability status, and logistics timing purposes. Low-performance solution invariants are generated and validated through functional requirements test case building. The data exchange network between the processing nodes of the IIoT environment is built on a software-defined network foundation. A simulation is then built for a series of work-in-process orders and their required processing operations, several manufacturing enterprises and associated physical logistics, and the cloud IIoT network cyber infrastructure for data and control information sharing. Both the formalized and the simulation models are run in the IIoT cloud and can be accessed by the participating enterprises. The formalized model provides insights on resource repair or replacement options, part transfer decisions, while the simulation model builds on those decisions and runs only validated scenarios anchored in timing- and cost-based constraints.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Jha2020.pdf",""

Key learnings from the International Congress on Engineering and Food, ICEF13, held in Melbourne, Australia, in September 2019, are highlighted. Some of the food systems and innovation trends conveyed in keynote talks, oral presentations, and e-posters summarized here are detailed in the chapters of this book and in special issues of two reference food engineering journals. A global overview of biosystems engineering solutions for developed and developing countries includes alternative protein sources, postharvest engineering for food waste transformation and sustainability. Then, advances in food processing technologies including refrigeration, freezing, thermal and nonthermal processing, and drying are discussed. An update on the innovative use of technologies such as extrusion for alternative ingredient production and innovative texturization, 3D food printing for personalized structuring and nutrition, pulsed electric field or hydrostatic pressure for structuring, as well as precision fermentation and other methods for bioactive incorporation is provided. The chapter also covers advances in ecofriendly antimicrobial and intelligent packaging with in-built micro- and nanosensors. Other sensor technologies integrated into digital manufacturing using Industry 4.0 are presented in the context of the food supply chain. Engineers are increasingly involved in consumer health research by creating more representative in vitro mimetics of human oral processing and digestion devices that are coupled with nutrient delivery models. The chapter concludes with suggestions to modify the food engineering curricula to (a) prepare food engineers of the future for global challenges appearing in both developing and developed countries, and (b) develop broader technical, interpersonal, and integrated regional and global supply chain skills. Food engineering will continue to play an important role in the development of cutting-edge smart processes that transform and personalize foods targeting individual nourishment and improved body function via controlled delivery strategies. Therefore, food engineering is broadening the scope beyond conventional unit operations and process design and optimization, to include environmental assessments, bioprocesses in the human body, and digital tools to identify circular and cost-effective solutions, and develop sustainable food systems.","","Food engineering, Innovation, Food supply chain, ICEF13 congress, Food system","",""

Through digitalization, societies aim to streamline their key functions and to develop modern services to inhabitants. 5G wireless networks are being built globally with lots of expectations put on them. It is anticipated that at the first phase of 5G, the technology will benefit the most different verticals like factories, hospitals and campuses. Universities have likewise awoken to establish digitalization projects to respond to the disruption of education and to overcome in the growing global competition. The transition to digital campus will inevitably rely on campus ICT and IoT infrastructures. Additionally, the number of terminals, devices, sensors and robots will multiply. This article proposes a technical architecture for future Smart Campus consisting of 5G and IoT networks complemented by distributed computing and data analytics. Increasing complexity of digital environment calls for a specific actor to operate the Smart Campus infrastructure and also services, which has not been widely discussed. It is foreseen that the university IT Administration is probably not willing to adopt the responsibility of enlarging infra and growing number of devices. Similarly, mobile network operators are not seen appropriate to take this role being commonly profiled to offer merely connectivity. To tackle this question, a novel operational model for the Smart Campuses is presented based on the recently proposed micro operator concept. Moreover, a case study of the University of Oulu campus is presented, where smart technology in the form of 5G test network has been deployed.","","","",""

Among the several benefits offered by these technologies, is the infrastructure for harnessing big-data, machine learning (ML) and cloud computing software tools, for instance in designing advanced data analytics platforms. Although, this is an area of increased interest, the information concerning the implementation of data analytics in the context of Industry4.0 is scarcely available in scientific literature. Therefore, this work presents a process data analytics platform built around the concept of industry 4.0. The platform utilizes the state-of-the-art IIoT platforms, ML algorithms and big-data software tools. The platform emphasizes the use of ML methods for process data analytics while leveraging big-data processing tools and taking advantage of the currently available industrial grade cloud computing platforms. The industrial applicability of the platform was demonstrated by the development of soft sensors for use in a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. In the case study, the work studied data-driven soft sensors to predict syngas heating value and hot flue gas temperature. Among the studied data-driven methods, the neural network-based NARX model demonstrated better performance in the prediction of both syngas heating value and flue gas temperature. The modeling results showed that, in cases where process knowledge about the process phenomena at hand is limited, data-driven soft sensors are useful tools for predictive data analytics.","","Data analytics platform, Industrial internet of things platform, Machine learning, Waste-to-energy, Soft sensor","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Kabugo2020.pdf",""

Based on current research, Lean production and Industry 4.0 strategies are promising in this regard. They argue to offer cost and time efficiency, labor productivity increase, and other benefits. In the literature, there are works on separate effects of Lean and Industry 4.0 on Sustainability, as well as high compatibility between Industry 4.0 and Lean, where one strategy comprehends the use of another. Only a few articles consider the integrated effect and mostly lack empirical validation. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on both separate and integrated effects of Lean and Industry 4.0 (Lean 4.0) on three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social). Additionally, several sustainability indicators as differentiation factors are formed and presented as a checklist to assess the effect of Lean and Industry 4.0 concepts. The findings reveal that Lean and Industry 4.0 has a somewhat uncertain or twofold correlation with sustainability, where Lean 4.0 has a strong positive correlation. The results of the study can be used by researchers for another large-scale research that empirically validates the developed hypothesis and by managers in the strategy development and decision-making processes.

Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of ‘new’ buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for ‘existing’ buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period.","","","",""

Self-organizing networks, WSN, m2m networks, IIoT, mesh networks are faced with the cyberthreats of specific character: dynamic routing failures, node isolation, DDoS attacks, traffic lack, etc. Most of them are caused by cybersecurity weaknesses: the software vulnerabilities and architectural features of dynamically reconfigured network. The existing methods of binary code analysis and intrusion detection can work with a small number of data sets, are designed for either code inspection or network checking, and are targeted for static networks with regular topology. The proposed neural model demonstrates an universal approach that deals with the cybersecurity weakness as a systems genuine property and attempts to approximate it using a hybrid deep ANN. The new ANN detects both the network security defects and binary code vulnerabilities at once with high accuracy (more than 0.97). It also shows good performance capacity processing big data of the undercontrolled network.","","","",""

Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack , which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary’s actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.","","","",""

Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes.

This paper is the first of its kind to pull together research on both—the pandemic-related challenges and the management interventions in a manufacturing context. This systematic literature review reveals the frailty of supply chains and production networks in withstanding the pressures of lockdowns and other safety protocols, including product and workforce shortages. These, altogether, have led to closed facilities, reduced capacities, increased costs, and severe economic uncertainty for manufacturing businesses. In managing these challenges and stabilising their operations, manufacturers are urgently intervening by—investing in digital technologies, undertaking resource redistribution and repurposing, regionalizing and localizing, servitizing, and targeting policies that can help them survive in this altered economy. Based on holistic analysis of these challenges and interventions, this review proposes an extensive research agenda for future studies to pursue.","","","",""

To reduce energy consumption, manufacturing operations need to develop energy efficient techniques. This development will also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and production costs. The aim of this research is to create a simulation methodology and to investigate the modelling of thermal and energy management (called e-ProMan) across manufacturing site. Using simulation, the ‘e-ProMan’ system generates a real-time, virtual and user-friendly factory model. A ‘Big Data’ approach is taken in which a large set of data are acquired from both inside and outside the factory in order to analyse the correlation between work flow, data flow and energy flow to provide real-time decision making. In particular, four data sources are gathered including weather forecast, temperature and humidity sensors, machine energy consumption and production process and scheduling. The ‘e-ProMan’ system is specifically designed to suit manufacturing operations of small and medium sizes to complement limited budget and lower resources especially in data gathering infrastructures.","","","",""

Thus, many ontologies covering this area have been developed. Consequently, for new projects aiming at reusing one of these ontologies, the process of evaluating them has become more and more time consuming and cumbersome. We evaluated eight well known ontologies for measurement units and the relevant parts of the Wikidata corpus. We automatically collected descriptive statistics about the ontologies and scanned them for potential errors, using an extensible collection of scripts. The computational results were manually reviewed, which uncovered several issues and misconceptions in the examined ontologies. The issues were reported to the ontology authors. This caused new bugfix releases in three cases. In this paper we will present the evaluation results including statistics as well as an overview of detected issues. We thereby want to enable a well-founded decision upon the unit ontology to use. Further, we hope to prevent errors in the future by describing some pitfalls in ontology development – not limited to the domain of measurement units.","","","",""

Exploring risk factors of digital technologies in industrial operations","International Journal of Production Economics",243,,"","108323",2022,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Both practitioners and scholars emphasise the benefits of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technology implementation, such as increased transparency and the availability of real-time data in operations processes. Current literature on I4.0 technologies tends to overemphasise the positive impact and transformational capabilities of digital technologies while there is little focus on evaluating potential risks associated with their adoption in industrial operations. An understanding of how supply chain risks are perceived in digitalisation projects within industrial operations and an understanding of decision-makers' responses to different types of risks has important managerial implications. Current literature, however, lacks systematic empirical evidence on the implementation of I4.0 applications and related risk factors. This study aims to address this research gap by exploring the relationship between I4.0 technologies and supply chain risks based on empirical evidence from 300 case studies of industrial practice in Germany and fifty-three interviews with relevant managers from selected use cases and with general experts in this field. Our findings show that digital technologies are frequently adopted to address certain existing supply chain risks but that their implementation introduces new sources of risks (e.g. cyber risks). Based on qualitative data analysis and drawing on Normal Accident Theory, we propose a framework to explicate the drivers and contingency factors of new sources of supply chain risks in the context of Industry 4.0 technologies. Practical recommendations are provided for supply chain managers to guide the process of managing supply chain risks based on the technological life cycle.","","Risk factors, Digitalisation, Technology life cycle, Normal accident theory, Industry 4.0 technologies, Technology vendors and users","",""

Fog users at the network’s edge communicate with many fog servers in different fogs and newly joined servers that they had never contacted before. This communication complexity brings enormous security challenges and potential vulnerability to malicious threats. The attacker may replace the edge device with a fake one and authenticate it as a legitimate device. Therefore, to prevent unauthorized users from accessing fog servers, we propose a new secure and lightweight multi-factor authentication scheme for cross-platform IoT systems (SELAMAT). The proposed scheme extends the Kerberos workflow and utilizes the AES-ECC algorithm for efficient encryption keys management and secure communication between the edge nodes and fog node servers to establish secure mutual authentication. The scheme was tested for its security analysis using the formal security verification under the widely accepted AVISPA tool. We proved our scheme using Burrows Abdi Needham’s logic (BAN logic) to prove secure mutual authentication. The results show that the SELAMAT scheme provides better security, functionality, communication, and computation cost than the existing schemes.","","","",""

As industry 4.0 reflects the fourth industrial revolution, water 4.0 reflects the fourth water revolution. Based on the literature review and case studies, this chapter examines a proposition that water 4.0 will increase not only the sector’s economic effectiveness but also sustainability including climate resilience.  Relevant technologies include digital twins, visualization, wireless monitoring sensors, industrial internet of things (IoT/IIoT), cloud computing, and predictive or prescriptive analytics but also blockchain, drones, and cybersecurity. For water 4.0 becoming a reality, water utility companies need not only collect more data but also to have proper analytical tools in place to convert data into information supporting optimal decisions. The current tools should preferably be replaced by machine learning algorithms that are nonlinear, nonstationary, and dynamic and thus aligned closely with the real world.  It has been suggested in this chapter that such disruptive technologies be introduced through an ISO 55001-based asset management system (AMS). ISO 19650 series supplements ISO 55001 and contains additional requirements for the AMS development by focusing particularly on asset information. For this purpose, the series provides assistance with big data and digital twins.  Two approaches are applicable to the implementation of water 4.0 through AMS: adaptability and more traditional continuous improvement with the former considered in this chapter as preferred but requires a sufficient level of asset management maturity. Therefore, it might be prudent that every organization sets their own water 4.0-related standards and objectives in their own AMS and considers the preferred level of adaptability. Adaptability is arguably required for water 4.0 with adaptation bringing the greatest value.","","","",""

Stochastic and dynamic properties of the situation and the mathematical complexity of the routing problem entailed and justified a simulation study. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach for routing UAVs and the validity of the proposed model are tested on a small sized realistic scenario.

In practical approaches, one finds many pitfalls restraining the application of these modern technologies especially in brownfield applications. With this paper, we want to show state of the art and what to expect when working with stock machines in the field. The paper is a review of literature found to cover challenges for cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) in brownfield applications. This review is combined with our own personal experience and findings gained while setting up such systems in processing and packaging machines as well as in other areas. A major focus in this paper is on data collection, which tends be more cumbersome than most people might expect. In addition, data quality for machine learning applications is a challenge once leaving the laboratory and its academic data sets. Topics here include missing ground truth or the lack of semantic description of the data. A last challenge covered is IT security and passing data through firewalls to allow for the cyber part in CPPS. However, all of these findings show that potentials of data driven production systems are strongly depending on data collection to build proclaimed new automation systems with more flexibility, improved human–machine interaction and better process-stability and thus less waste during manufacturing.","","","",""

From a business perspective, IoT can be regarded as a business transformation, driving commoditization or even threatening conventional businesses, providing opportunities for product and process improvements and opening perspectives for services business or entirely new businesses based on data acquired by IoT. While the development of the Internet of Things resembles in many aspects the characteristics of for example semiconductor and IT platforms, there are some essential differences, mainly in scale and scope, that make the kickstart of a successful IoT more complex.

However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed ICS streams using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically produces a very large DFA and a high false-alarm rate. In this article, we introduce a new modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to their respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the statechart from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning algorithms first build a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the stream. Next, we split the symbols into sets, one per multiplexed cycle, based on symbol frequencies and node degrees in the DTMC graph. Then, we create a sub-graph for each cycle and extract Euler cycles for each sub-graph. The final statechart is comprised of one DFA per Euler cycle. The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, which appear in more than one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once in a cycle. We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a collection of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed ICS traces with varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The algorithms were able to split the symbols into sets with 99.6% accuracy. The resulting statechart modeled the traces with a median false-alarm rate of as low as 0.483%. In all but the most extreme scenarios, the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm rate and the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA model.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Kleinmann2017.pdf",""

Companies’ digital transformation can become one of such effective mechanisms. The purpose of the study is to examine the influence of company’s digital transformation on achieving the goals of sustainable development. To this end, we analyze annual reports and research on the issues of digital transformation, economic and sustainable development of the leading companies in the global electronic industry, namely: Samsung, Intel, and NVIDIA. For a better understanding of the correlation among the key components of the research subject, we apply the methods of schematization and classification of objects. The study shows four types of digital transformation management strategies depending on the level of the organization’s digital maturity and the goals of its sustainable development. We conclude that sustainable development (including economic, social and environmental ones) in the long term in the current environment of complicated global economic and internal economic relations can be achieved, first of all, through the comprehensive digital transformation of the organization. In other words, digitally matured companies can achieve sustainability, and, therefore, competitiveness.","","","",""

More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and many cities have already transformed into “smart digital/virtual hubs. Digital services ensure city life safe without an economy lockout and unemployment. Urban society strives to be safe, sustainable, well-being, and healthy. We set the task to construct a hybrid sociological and technological concept of a smart city with matched solutions, complementary to each other. Our modeling with the elaborated digital architectures and with the bionic solution for ensuring sufficient data governance showed that a smart city in comparison with the traditional city is tightly interconnected inside like a social “organism. Society has entered a decisive decade during which the world will change by moving closer towards SDGs targets 2030 as well as by the transformation of cities and their digital infrastructures. It is important to recognize the large vector of sociological transformation as smart cities are just a transition phase to human-centered personal space or smart home. The “atomization of the world urban population raises the gap problem in achieving SDGs because of different approaches to constructing digital architectures for smart cities or smart homes in countries. The strategy of creating smart cities should bring each citizen closer to SDGs at the individual level, laying in the personal space the principles of sustainable development and wellness of personality.","","","",""

The digital economy, which includes a wide range of IT technologies in business processes and models, helps to stimulate demand growth, leading to an increase in productivity and employment of the population, has the potential to achieve inclusive results.In the context of rapid digitalization, it is becoming clear that digital innovation, called digital transformation, is becoming the main driving force behind social transformation. The transition to sustainable development and for all must be consistent with the goals, risks, opportunities and dynamics of the digitalization of the economy. At the same time, digital transformation will radically change all processes occurring in the global economy and every state, therefore, it will change the interpretation of the very paradigm of sustainable development. Digitization is not only a "tool" for addressing sustainable development challenges but also a fundamental driver of disruptive change.Advanced technologies are now the driving force behind what has been dubbed Industry 4.0, with the potential to transform Russia's industrial sectors and significant social, economic and environmental impacts on society. This digital transformation of business and society in Russia represents a huge growth potential for the country in the context of the stagnation of the global consumer market and its transition to a digital environment.","","Enterprise Management, Trade, Digitalization, Digital Platforms, Industry 4.0, Data Arrays, Digital Technologies, Digital Transformation","",""

Disruptions may also cause the systems engineer to adapt in the environment and workplace such as disruptions in technology, processes, and people-system interfaces. Future systems engineering efforts may be applied to different domains other than the traditional defense and aerospace projects. These include healthcare, transportation, environment, cybersecurity and Internet of Things, and manufacturing. Systems engineers may need to reconsider the traditional modality of their education.

Currently, we are developing such twins for analyzing the operation of environmentally friendly equipment of infrastructural objects located in the Baikal natural territory. The proposed framework is based on the integrated applying methods and tools of knowledge engineering, multi-agent technologies, conceptual and service-oriented programming, and administration of hybrid distributed computing systems. These systems can include both personal resources and resources of public access centers, grid systems, and cloud or fog platforms.

Therefore, the minimization of engine operating cost per flight-hour is a key aspect for airlines to operate successfully under challenging market conditions. The interaction between maintenance cost, operating cost, asset value, lease and replacement cost describes the area of conflict in which engine fleets can be optimized. State-of-the-art fleet management is based on advanced diagnostic and prognostic methods on engine and component level to provide optimized long-term removal and work-scoping forecasts on fleet level based on the individual operation. The key element of these methods is a digital twin of the active engines consisting of multilevel models of the engine and its components. This digital twin can be used to support deterioration and failure analysis, predict life consumption of critical parts and relate the specific operation of a customer to the real and expected condition of the engines on-wing and at induction to the shop. The fleet management data is constantly updated based on operational data sent from the engines as well as line maintenance and shop data. The approach is illustrated along the real application on the CFM56-5C, a mature commercial two-spool high bypass engine installed on the Airbus A340-300. It can be shown, that the new methodology results in major improvements on the considered fleets.","","","",""

When creating digital platforms, a number of difficulties arise: the large dimension of the digital infrastructure and its heterogeneity, poorly established information interaction between the segments, the lack of a common approach to ensuring cybersecurity, and high dependence on personnel qualification and reliability of equipment. The introduction of the digital economy leads to an increase in the risk of cyber threats associated with problems of access control between systems, regulation of information, and control flows. In this paper, for solving cyber threat detection tasks, it is proposed to use generative adversarial neural networks. The paper presents training and testing algorithms of the neural network.

This chapter uses a number of practical applications and real-world examples to delve into blockchain's roles in contributing to these objectives. A key argument is that blockchain makes it possible to trace ingredients and components across multiple tiers of a supply chain because data must be shared in a tamperproof way and must be accessible to relevant parties. Blockchain, thus, facilitates traceability, which is among the key mechanisms by which blockchain can help firms meet the various supply chain objectives.","","Auditability, Blockchain, Internet of things, Network effects, Supply chain objectives, Sustainability","",""

With this, the SG will able to “detect, react, and pro-act to changes in usage and address multiple issues, thereby ensuring timely grid operations. However, the “detect, react, and pro-act features in DER-based SG can only be accomplished at the fullest level with the use of technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the Blockchain (BC). The techniques associated with AI include fuzzy logic, knowledge-based systems, and neural networks. They have brought advances in controlling DER-based SG. The IoT and BC have also enabled various services like data sensing, data storage, secured, transparent, and traceable digital transactions among ESN peers and its clusters. These promising technologies have gone through fast technological evolution in the past decade, and their applications have increased rapidly in ESN. Hence, this study discusses the SG and applications of AI, IoT, and BC. First, a comprehensive survey of the DER, power electronics components and their control, electric vehicles (EVs) as load components, and communication and cybersecurity issues are carried out. Second, the role played by AI-based analytics, IoT components along with energy internet architecture, and the BC assistance in improving SG services are thoroughly discussed.

This paper analyses the social acceptability dimensions of I4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing (DM) and proposes a novel framework. The dimensions were identified through an extensive literature review. A data set of 121 responses was collected from different Indian manufacturing units and exploratory factor analysis was employed with dimensions structured into seven categories - safety, psychological, behavioural, compliance, cultural, employee and market. To develop inter-relationships amongst the main dimensions, a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique was utilized. Based on the priority order, 'security breaches' is the most significant dimension, followed by 'data theft'. The study contributes to both the theory of socio-technical transition (TSTT) and social cognition theory (SCT) by describing the impact of I4.0 technologies on social and personal behaviour. The study findings make significant contributions to both the practical and managerial perspectives of I4.0 technologies for the growth of DM. This paper provides fruitful insights for decision-makers and industry practitioners to develop a DM environment.","","Industry 4.0, Social dimensions, Empirical analysis, Digital manufacturing, Socio-technical transition, Revolution","",""

Built on this requirement, a “chatty" factory involves creating products which are able to send data back to the manufacturing/production environment as they are used, whilst still ensuring user privacy. The intended use of a product during design phase may different significantly from actual usage. Understanding how this data can be used to support continuous product refinement, and how the manufacturing process can be dynamically adapted based on the availability of this data provides a number of opportunities. We describe how data collected on product use can be used to: (i) classify product use; (ii) associate a label with product use using unsupervised learning—making use of edge-based analytics; (iii) transmission of this data to a cloud environment where labels can be compared across different products of the same type. Federated learning strategies are used on edge devices to ensure that any data captured from a product can be analysed locally (ensuring data privacy).","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Lakoju2021.pdf",""

It is considered a major and inexorable driving force of innovation and disruption that challenges private and public organizations equally. With all economic and societal sectors being affected, digital economy is very dynamic and increasingly competitive. It empowers new startup ventures – backed by many billion dollars of venture capital – to create novel value propositions by leveraging digital technologies. Their highly scalable, data-driven, and software-centric operating models increasingly collide with incumbent companies and poise an existential threat to their business. Just think about Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android smartphones, for example. Built on a consistent digital platform, both companies attracted ever-expanding ecosystems of third-party app developers that ultimately caused Nokia to tumble from a position of phone industry dominance into irrelevance. This story is threatening to repeat everywhere across the economy: The cloud computing services of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are challenging traditional software and hardware providers, the online marketplaces of Amazon and Alibaba are replacing traditional retailers and challenge companies like on-demand Walmart, and the video delivery services of Netflix and Hulu are about to disrupt traditional pay TV providers. Another very popular example is the online booking platforms Airbnb and Booking.com that leverage digital technologies to simplify booking and offer personalized and individually tailored travel experiences while disrupting the business of traditional hotel chains including Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt. In order to capture the benefits of digital technologies, established organizations – independently of whether they operate in the public or private sector – are forced to incorporate them into their own ecosystem to advance their product and service portfolios through an organizational change process that is commonly referred to as digital transformation. This process of technology adaptation is particularly challenging for companies that were – in contrast to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others – not “born digital since those companies need to undergo far-reaching business transitions that may well overturn established job designs and internal business processes and require novel ways of thinking and collaboration.","","","",""

Especially German enterprises reached a high degree of maturity regarding the implementation of Lean Production Systems. Another, newer concept is Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is one of the most promising approaches to handle future production problems. For example, the flexibility of the production system resulting from Industry 4.0 helps manufacturers to cope with the high demand for customized products. However, Industry 4.0 entails deep technical and organizational changes for production systems, that may affect a Lean Production System. It needs to be considered that there are not only positive combinations of Lean Production Systems and Industry 4.0. It is unclear, how both concepts can be operated together and which methods are useful to fulfill the aims of a modern production system. The paper addresses this issue by presenting the development of a method library for the combination of the elements of the Lean Production System and technologies of Industry 4.0. For this purpose, the reciprocal effects of the Lean Production System and the Industry 4.0 technologies are examined regarding the scope of production. These results are the foundation of the method library where all combined methods are consistently presented.","","","",""

The level of desired collaboration and increased flexibility will only be reached if the systems are developed as a whole, e.g. perception, reasoning and physical manipulation. The rising need for collaborative robots in the automation industry is acting as a driver for this market and is expected to serve as a market opportunity for future growth. However, at the same time especially smaller companies have difficulties to formulate a concrete vision and strategies for the uptake of robotics, finding skilled workforce to develop and deploy the robot systems and/or work in the manufacturing industry.

This integration carries along both challenges and new opportunities. The combination of software and hardware elements implies more complex systems that are prone to intricate interdependencies that affect the overall reliability. To this, usually, we need to add the human-computer interaction that is also a vital aspect of the functioning of CPS, which further complicates the reliability calculations. Unreliable systems can mean huge losses, both financially as well as in human lives. On a positive note, CPS have data as a central element of their operation. The availability and prevalence of data present a new opportunity to transform the ways in which reliability assessment has been traditionally performed. The goal of this contribution is to provide a holistic overview of the reliability analysis of CPS, as well as identify the impact that data and new data infrastructures may have on it. We, furthermore, illustrate the key points through two well-known cases of CPS, smart buildings and smart factories.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\LazarovaMolnar2020.pdf",""

This integration is colloquially known as a “smart industry. To enable the realization of smart manufacturing systems, a clear roadmap for systematic development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial systems is necessary and for that, the concept of Industrial AI would play an important role. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the important role of key enabling technologies of Industrial AI in the manufacturing industry in general and how their systematic adoption will aid in producing new value-creation opportunities and avoidance of problems that haven’t even occurred yet.","","Industrial AI, Smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Cyberphysical systems, Enabling technologies","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Lee2020.pdf",""

Its learning process employs frequent communications as the participating local devices send updates, either gradients or parameters of their models, to a central server that aggregates them and redistributes new weights to the devices. In FL, private data does not leave the individual local devices, and thus, rendered as a robust solution in terms of privacy preservation. However, the recently introduced membership inference attacks pose a critical threat to the impeccability of FL mechanisms. By eavesdropping only on the updates transferring to the center server, these attacks can recover the private data of a local device. A prevalent solution against such attacks is the differential privacy scheme that augments a sufficient amount of noise to each update to hinder the recovering process. However, it suffers from a significant sacrifice in the classification accuracy of the FL. To effectively alleviate the problem, this paper proposes a Digestive Neural Network (DNN), an independent neural network attached to the FL. The private data owned by each device will pass through the DNN and then train the FL. The DNN modifies the input data, which results in distorting updates, in a way to maximize the classification accuracy of FL while the accuracy of inference attacks is minimized. Our simulation result shows that the proposed DNN shows significant performance on both gradient sharing- and weight sharing-based FL mechanisms. For the gradient sharing, the DNN achieved higher classification accuracy by 16.17% while 9% lower attack accuracy than the existing differential privacy schemes. For the weight sharing FL scheme, the DNN achieved at most 46.68% lower attack success rate with 3% higher classification accuracy.","","Federated learning (FL), Inference attack, White-box assumption, Digestive neural networks, t-SNE analysis, Federated learning security, ML Security, AI Security","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Lee2021.pdf",""

Leveraging a multiple case study involving eight companies, we identify five enablers of data democratization: (1) Broader data access, (2) Self-service analytics tools, (3) Development of data and analytics skills, (4) Collaboration and knowledge sharing, and (5) Promotion of data value.

Enabling technologies include robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology (DLT), to name a few. Such technologies do not work in isolation. Instead, they come usually as bundled in solutions. There are many use cases for the digitization and automation of processes in the logistics industry—in the area of logistics corridors and trade hubs, trade facilitation, consumer touch points and interaction, circular services, digital platforms and marketplaces, supply chain monitoring, risk management, trade and supply chain finance, and talent search and training, and decision making.

This paper surveys how blockchain can overcome potential barriers to achieving sustainability from two perspectives, namely, the manufacturing system perspective and the product lifecycle management perspective. The survey first examines literature on these two perspectives, following which the state of research in blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing is presented, which sheds new light on urgent issues as part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We found that blockchain-empowered transformation of a sustainable manufacturing paradigm is still in an early stage of the hype phase, proceeding toward full adoption. The survey ends with a discussion of challenges regarding techniques, social barriers, standards, and regulations with respect to blockchain-empowered manufacturing applications.

Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line.

Smart manufacturing utilizes rich process data, usually collected by the SMS (e.g., machine tools), to enable accurate tracking and monitoring of individual products throughout the process chain. However, until now, the to-be-manufactured product itself has not contributed to the sensing and compilation of product and process data. More specifically, data measured from the product’s structure during its own fabrication. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the opportunity to actively use the capabilities of smart products within a SMS in terms of technical and economic feasibility. This opportunity emerged only recently with the advancements in smart products engineering. In this research, we developed a smart product prototype and evaluated it on a SMS testbed (CPlab) with eight distinct, fully-connected manufacturing processes. The results of the conducted experiments show the possibility to uniquely identify two distinct ‘fingerprints’ of manufacturing processes solely based on data provided by sensors within the smart product itself. The sensor data was collected directly from the smart product before manufacture was completed, yet after the intended sensor functionality during the product’s use phase was activated. The capability to automatically, accurately, and reliably identify process signatures and even inform the optimization of manufacturing parameters creates new opportunities for improvements in quality, scheduling, and seamless transparency across the whole value chain.","","Smart product, Smart manufacturing, Integrated sensor system, Data analytics, PLM, Industry 4.0","",""

Here, a workflow based on a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm is described for the model-assisted development of biotechnological processes. By using the NMPC algorithm, the process is designed with respect to a target function (product yield, biomass concentration) with a drastically decreased number of experiments. A workflow for the usage of the NMPC algorithm as a process development tool is outlined. The NMPC algorithm is capable of improving various process states, such as product yield and biomass concentration. It uses on-line and at-line data and controls and optimizes the process by model-based process extrapolation. In this study, the algorithm is applied to a Corynebacterium glutamicum process. In conclusion, the potency of the NMPC algorithm as a powerful tool for process development is demonstrated. In particular, the benefits of the system regarding the characterization and optimization of a fed-batch process are outlined. With the NMPC algorithm, process development can be run simultaneously to strain development, resulting in a shortened time to market for novel products.","","","",""

Simultaneously, it enables business process improvement by increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Despite these opportunities, DT projects bear a high risk level and require a structured approach. Thus, mastering the digital competencies is necessary for the future workforce, independently of their position. Current research, however, often keeps the operational level uninvestigated, focusing too much on the top-manager perspective. This paper aims at closing this gap by reviewing the literature on business process transformation and corresponding KPIs in manufacturing companies and validating the findings through expert interviews. We aggregate gained expertise from various perspectives into a KPI overview, combining the KPIs for production, maintenance, sustainability, and IT. This helps to reduce complexity and mitigate the risk of Digital Transformation projects, for example by applying simulation to predict project outcomes.","","","",""

The profit model for EcLRE is moving towards offering professional logistics services instead of simple real estate leasing. As the attributes for real estate are definite and difficult to change, the improvement of logistics service becomes necessity for EcLRE service providers to gain competitiveness in the market. However, the heterogeneous requirements from different service demanders place great challenges for the EcLRE service providers. The most puzzled one is to prevent fragmentation of logistics resources to serve different demanders (customers). This phenomenon of resource fragmentation is aggravated by the implementation of demanders’ (customers’) own information technologies or management requirements. To achieve the central management of logistics resources to serve heterogeneous demanders becomes an imperative requirement for EcLRE service provider. Therefore, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled workflow operating system (Bc-WfOS) to centrally share heterogeneous logistics resources with different customers. Three key innovative technologies are involved to empower Bc-WfOS. The first one is gateway technology introduced to realize the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of heterogeneous logistics resources. Secondly, to effectively and efficiently coordinate logistics resources, a multi-dimensional workflow model is proposed with corresponding workflow operation mechanism to suit different business logic. Additionally, a resource blockchain is designed with the integration of blockchain technology with agent technology to guarantee the data reliability to provide accurate front-line resource execution data for different customers to conduct higher decision-makings. Aiming at verifying the proposed Bc-WfOS, a prototype system is also developed and implemented in laboratory environment for conducting experimental case studies based on a real-life case.","","Workflow operation, Resource blockchain, Logistics resources sharing, E-commerce logistics real estate service","",""

However, a variety of technical challenges, e.g., security issues, incentive mechanism design, are still awaiting further research efforts. In this respect, blockchain proves to be an elegant solution for federated learning to overcome these issues, and thus has been applied in federated learning in many scenarios with success. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey for blockchain-enabled federated learning, proposed its technical framework and discussed the key research issues. This work represents the first attempt for reviewing the literature aiming at integrating blockchain and federated learning, and can be expected to offer useful guidance for establishing a new infrastructure for decentralized and secured data circulation, as well as promoting the development of related industries.","","Industries;Data privacy;Digital twin;Conferences;Machine learning;Collaborative work;Rendering (computer graphics);blockchain;federated learning;smart contract","",""

This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale.

Developing on top of Industry 4.0 paradigms, advanced robotics, predictive analytics, and process flow automation benefit from the use of digital replicas known as digital twins (DT). DT is a prevailing technology in manufacturing industries and leverages real-time monitoring, simulation, and decision-aid systems to generate feasible solutions to assist production operations, which can range from predictive maintenance to strategic planning. As a trending technology, many digital twin-driven approaches are formulated to achieve mass customization and implement smart product service systems. Hence, this chapter aims to provide insights into the various digital twin architectures and development trends in manufacturing environments. It also proposes the integration of other emerging technologies to allow stakeholders who are capitalizing on this technology to gain a significant competitive edge in the present competitive environment. With consideration to both business innovation and engineering product lifecycle management, this work serves as a guide to highlight the status of digital twin development trends and benefits with innovative use cases aiming at setting a consistent standard for digital twin creation throughout academia and industry.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Lim2021.pdf",""

It is widely accepted that blockchain technology causes disruptive changes in supply chain operations that can overcome supply chain difficulties encountered in realizing information sharing, maintaining traceability in the entire process and improving operational efficiency. However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential. This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations. A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes. This article provides valuable information to help scholars and practitioners better determine the relevant research topics to accelerate the development of blockchain-based supply chains.","","Supply chain, Blockchain, Descriptive and content analysis, Literature review","",""

This is further catalysed through the need for society to make informed policies and decisions that can properly support their emerging growth. While data systems and platforms exist, they are often proprietary, being only compatible to the products that they are designed for. Given the products and services generate energy and spatial-temporal data that can often correlate, a lack of interoperability between these systems would impede decision making, as data from each system must be considered independently. By studying currently available data platforms and frameworks, this paper weighs the problems that these products address, and identifies necessary gaps for a more cohesive platform to exist. This is performed through a top-down approach, whereby broader vehicle-to-everything approaches are first studied, before moving to the components that could comprise a data platform to integrate and ingest these various data feeds. Finally, potential design considerations for a data platform is presented, along with examples of application benefits that would enable users to make more informed and holistic decisions about current mobility options.","","Connected mobility, Vehicular networks, Data platforms, Electric vehicles","",""

Digital twin (DT) brings about a possible means, due to its ability to provide candidate behavior adjustments based on received “feedbacks from its physical part. However, such candidate adjustments are deterministic, and thus lack of flexibility and adaptability. To address such problem, in this paper an extended concept – evolutionary digital twin (EDT) and an EDT-based new mode for intelligent industrial product development has been proposed. With our proposed EDT, a more precise approximated model of the physical world could be established through supervised learning, based on which the collaborative exploration for optimal policies via parallel simulation in multiple cyberspaces could be performed through reinforcement learning. Hence, more flexibility and adaptability could be brought to industrial products through machine learning (such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning) based self-evolution. As a primary verification of the effectiveness of our proposed approach, a case study has been carried out. The experimental results have well confirmed the effectiveness of our EDT based development mode.","","Evolutionary digital twin, Intelligent industrial product, Collaborative evolution, Approximate world, Multiple cyber spaces, Simple evolution paradigm, Model evolution paradigm","",""

By offloading real-time mobile data to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers for processing and modeling, communication-efficient Digital Twin (DT) services could be achieved. However, the spatio-temporal dynamic DT service demand stochastically generated by mobile users easily causes service congestion, which challenges the long-term DT service stability. Meanwhile, current DT services still lack long-term effective incentive designs for participants. To solve these issues, we design an incentive-based congestion control scheme for stochastic demand response in DTENs. First, we adopt the Lyapunov optimization theory to decompose the long-term congestion control decision into a sequence of online edge association decisions, with no need for future system information. We then present a contract-based incentive design to optimize the long-term profit of the DT service provider, comprehensively considering the delay sensitivity, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme with the base station dataset of Shanghai Telecom. Theoretical and simulation analysis demonstrates that compared with benchmarks, our scheme could effectively avoid long-term service congestion with an arbitrarily near-optimal profit.","","Computational modeling;Stochastic processes;Digital twin;Task analysis;Stability analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Optimization;Mobile Edge Computing;Digital Twin;stochastic demand response;congestion control","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Lin2021a.pdf",""

Significant CPS achievements, namely real-time monitoring, automation, digital twin representation, and bi-directionality can only be achieved through proper understanding of CPS at various levels. Having a clear understanding of the requirements, processes, and characteristics of CPS is needed to make for proper CPS implementation in the industry. For this purpose, these requirements are evaluated in this chapter from three levels, namely, device level, platform level and system level, to cover all the factors from micro to macro perspective.

Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Liu2020.pdf",""

Humanoid robots are a great challenge in robotics. The concept of digital twin technology complies with the guiding ideology of not only Industry 4.0, but also Made in China 2025. This paper proposes a scheme that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with digital twin technology for controlling humanoid robot arms. For rapid and stable motion planning for humanoid robots, multitasking-oriented training using the twin synchro-control (TSC) scheme with DRL is proposed. For switching between tasks, the robot arm training must be quick and diverse. In this work, an approach for obtaining a priori knowledge as input to DRL is developed and verified using simulations. Two simple examples are developed in a simulation environment. We developed a data acquisition system to generate angle data efficiently and automatically. These data are used to improve the reward function of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and quickly train the robot for a task. The approach is applied to a model of the humanoid robot BHR-6, a humanoid robot with multiple-motion mode and a sophisticated mechanical structure. Using the policies trained in the simulations, the humanoid robot can perform tasks that are not possible to train with existing methods. The training is fast and allows the robot to perform multiple tasks. Our approach utilizes human joint angle data collected by the data acquisition system to solve the problem of a sparse reward in DRL for two simple tasks. A comparison with simulation results for controllers trained using the vanilla DDPG show that the designed controller developed using the DDPG with the TSC scheme have great advantages in terms of learning stability and convergence speed.","","","",""

Unfortunately, recent incidents show that MSPs themselves have become an attractive launchpad to gain access to customer networks. In this work, we argue that such incidents arise due to a violation of the least privilege principle. We revisit the MSP outsourcing problem through this least-privilege view, identify key challenges in realizing this framework, and present initial ideas toward this goal. In particular, we propose providing the MSP provider an isolated "digital twin" environment to resolve problems and prevent providers from directly accessing the customer production network. Changes are verified before importing them into the production network, ensuring there are no privilege violations. Our preliminary experiments show that our approach can resolve practical problems (e.g., misconfigurations) and is effective in reducing the attack surfaces for MSP customers.","","","",""

Specifically, a DT-assisted Task Offloading Scheme (DTTOS) which consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel State Information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two sub-optimization models and solved by Decision Tree Algorithm (DTA) and Double Deep-Q-Learning (DDQN) respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.","","Task analysis;Collaboration;Artificial intelligence;Delays;Servers;Blockchain;Data models;Digital twin;edge collaboration;blockchain;artificial intelligence.","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Liu2021b.pdf",""

Second, the prototype of a Service-oriented Digital Twin, which leverage on a flexible ontology-oriented knowledge structure and on augmented reality combined to a vocal interaction system for an intuitive knowledge retrieval and fruition, has been designed and developed to deliver this manufacturing knowledge. Two test-beds, complimentary for the problems in practice (the former on the maintenance-production interface in a large enterprise, the latter majorly focused in production and setups in a small and medium enterprise), show the significant benefits in terms of time, costs and process quality, thus validating the approach proposed.

The widespread transformation of healthcare organizations, the creation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystems based on wireless sensor networks are increasing the number of potential risks of confidential information leakage. Medical data requires constant protection. The problem of identifying risks in order to develop methods and tools for their management in the future is further complicated by the fact that Healthcare Industry is increasingly beginning to use the cloud architecture of the IoMT, which in turn increases the potential threats to patients' confidential information. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of ransomware programs that are being introduced into IoMT devices has increased, cyberattacks are becoming more complex with a significantly higher risk of fatal consequences for patients due to changes in the technical parameters of medical equipment by attackers.

The sizing of the buses will allow to reduce the waiting times of flights below the level of service required by international standards. For this purpose, the development of a discrete event simulation model integrated to the transactional flight database is proposed. In the literature, although many references to simulation models have been found in airports, they have not been specifically focused in order to size and manage the bus fleet.

Detection methods based on lumped timing range are also evaluated and compared. We design several hardware detectors implementing these data-driven detection methods, which non-intrusively measuring lumped/subcomponent timing of all system/function calls of the embedded application.

The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem.

With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Lu2021a.pdf",""

Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.","","internet of things, wireless security, data fusion, machine learning, adversarial machine learning","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Luo2020.pdf",""

However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods, which face the growing volume of data and need domain-specific knowledge, cannot be directly applied to address these challenges. To this end, deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed. In this article, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation, and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. Also, we discuss the limitations and open problems of these methods. Moreover, to give users insights into choosing proper DLAD methods in practice, we experimentally explore the characteristics of typical neural models, the workflow of DLAD methods, and the running performance of DL models. Finally, we discuss the deficiencies of DL approaches, our findings, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods and motivate future research.","","","",""

Therefore, the need to rethink the professional figures of an engineer has become a necessity. Unfortunately, neither a formal methodology to define a standard engineer archetype nor procedural methods to evaluate such archetypes’ contribution to SD are investigated. This paper bridges the first gap by proposing a general methodology to define specific engineer archetypes as technical competences from educational - Semi Structured Intended Learning Outcomes (SS-ILOs) - and occupational - European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) - frameworks. The second gap is addressed by a procedural method based on indirect mapping of the identified archetypes onto United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). Since Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the working environment of future engineers and has a promising potential to achive SDGs, I4.0 technologies influences on SDGs are used as a bridge to evaluate sustainability of the defined enigineer archetypes. Finally, we provide the application of our proposed methodology to the Industrial engineering case study. The results show that significant limitations toward sustainability remain open challenges. However, the intrinsic nature of the industrial engineer is confined to some specific goals, and a characteristic signature on sustainability emerged.","","Industry 4.0, Engineer archetype, Sustainable development goals, Educational & professional engineer, Industrial engineering","",""

Based on 5Gcommunication, the deep learning (DL) algorithm is introduced to construct the UAV Digital Twins (DTs) communication channel model based on DL. The Coordinated Multi-point Transmission (COMP) technology is adopted to study the interference suppression of UAVs. The key algorithm in the physical layer security is employed to ensure information communication security. Finally, the model constructed is simulated and analyzed. The transmission error rates and transmission estimation accuracy of several algorithms, including the proposed algorithm and ordinary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are compared under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Results find that the convergence speed and convergence effect of the proposed algorithm has prominent advantages, presenting strong robustness; the proposed algorithm's estimation accuracy is about 150 times higher than the traditional algorithms. Further analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm's accuracy reaches 82.39%, which increases by at least 3.2% than other classic machine algorithms. The indicators of Precision, Recall, and F1 are compared as well. Apparently, the Precision, Recall, and F1 values of the proposed algorithm are the highest, while the transmission delay is the smallest. Therefore, the constructed UAV DTs wireless communication channel model has strong robustness and further reduces UAV limitations, providing a reference for improving UAV system performance in the later stage.","","Unmanned aerial vehicle, B5G, Deep learning, Coordinated multi-point transmission, Physical layer security, Digital twins","",""

The factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users. This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry. Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis of secondary data contained within published journal articles that focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b) test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to 2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other important factors such as ``perceived immersion″ could be added to the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider acceptance.","","","",""

All of these phases will be characterized by a high level of dynamism: the driving behavior of automated cars and production processes in a factory will likewise be controlled by learning and adaptive systems that evolve over time to deal with quickly changing tasks and environments. Automated cars on the roads and robots in factories are both highly mobile and need to collaborate in dynamic neighborhoods. What are the ICT infrastructures and engineering methods that are required to build such highly dynamic but at the same time trustworthy autonomous systems? In this position paper we argue that in the context of infrastructure, a “Decimeter Internet will be needed that offers low-enough communication latencies, adequately accurate localization plus update rates equal to the task of dependably controlling mobile cars and robots at decimeter level. With respect to engineering methods, we argue the strong need for approaches, which will ensure the dependability of learning and adaptive systems that change their behavior during runtime.","","","",""

Importantly, it reduces workforce intervention in risky industrial environments. Some of the best practicing places and activities for the IIoT employment are factory shop floors, materials handling, assembly lines, production processes, finalising goods, and other inbound and outbound logistical tasks. The basis for the IIoT phenomenon growth is the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which have currently been ensuring efficient work execution in many spheres, industrial as well as commercial and social. This chapter provides a discussion on IIoT concepts and definitions, on business drivers behind the growth of this technology, and the evolution process of this phenomenon. This contribution also discusses the fundamental underlying principles, related technologies, deployment approaches in different areas and associated frameworks.

With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.","","Analytical models;Tools;Inspection;Aerospace testing;Emergency services;Distance measurement;Data models","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Madni2021a.pdf",""

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged and forced out the ephemeral conventional approaches. Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.","","Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Energy sustainability, SDG 7, Renewable energy transition, Energy policies, Energy affordability, Digitalization, SDG interaction","",""

Despite the market is driving towards integrated and interconnected factories, current smart manufacturing systems are still designed under the assumption that they will stay isolated from the corporate network and the outside world. This choice may result in an internal architecture with insufficient network and system compartmentalization. As a result, once an attacker has gained access, they have full control of the entire production plant because of the lack of network segmentation. With the goal of raising cybersecurity awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study showing attack scenarios that we have validated on a real modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical security counter measures. The testbed smart manufacturing system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory hosted by Politecnico di Milano, and comprises seven assembly stations, each with their programmable logic controllers and human-computer interfaces, as well as an industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place tasks. On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a system not directly connected to any public network. We conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an adversary can use to cause physical impact on the production, or keep persistent access to the plant. We are unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the premises of a research facility, following a scientific methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a good first step to inspire follow up research on the many verticals that we touch.","","Cybersecurity, Malware, ICS Security, Smart Manufacturing, Industry 4.0","",""

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the grid-edge control with various control architectures, layers, and strategies. The challenges and opportunities for such an approach at the grid edge with the integration of DERs and digital transformation are summarised.

Previous research identifies that shadow IT is often collaborative systems used by employees to collaborate, communicate, and share content with coworkers, clients, or external partners. Based on these previous findings, we propose that shadow IT usage may positively influence organizational knowledge sharing (KS), which is central to knowledge management practices. Thus, this research aims to (1) identify the types and occurrences of shadow IT used by employee in the workplace, (2) investigate how KS (donation and collection) occurs via shadow IT, and (3) investigate how shadow IT influences KS. This is an exploratory study based on a qualitative approach. We performed interviews with IT users to answer the research question. Our findings identify that most of the interviewees use collaborative systems and mobile devices unauthorized by the IT department to share knowledge and communicate with their coworkers. The most common IT cited are WhatsApp and Skype, as well as solutions to store and share content, like Google Drive. In addition, several employees reported using shadow IT mainly because organizations do not provide suitable tools to communicate efficiently. We conclude that shadow IT can facilitate KS, primarily when people are geographically distributed since these unauthorized systems provide real-time communication. Our theoretical contribution is to expand current knowledge about shadow IT and reinforce the importance and prevalence of informal and decentralized KS within organizations. As for the practical implications, our article can help IT managers to better understand the usage of shadow IT and how they can balance the risk and benefits of this phenomenon.","","","",""

We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM.

In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360 degrees camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360 degrees live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360 degrees web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.","","","",""

These could contribute not only to the efficiency metrics of operation but to the effectiveness of the business as well. The different levels of digital transformation presented in this paper all contribute to these benefits, and the future holds new opportunities with the further advancement of cognitive solutions. These technologies have already proven their capabilities, but their implementation is always difficult and should be custom-made. Quantitative and qualitative research was conducted to discover business practices related to the digitalisation of the business services sector in a Central and Eastern European country. This paper provides insight into a major Hungarian-based business services centre with three unique cases of digital technology implementation projects. Through these cases, the paper reveals the process of selection and introduction as well as outcomes of digitalisation projects in the examined company. The paper ensures an overview of new technologies that could be used in the sector to build a framework called Business Services 4.0.","","","",""

To succeed in this competition, industry incumbents must learn to extend their traditional product and service business through platforms. However, extant research has focused primarily on the ability of platform owners to govern mature platforms for innovation but has largely ignored how industry incumbents can build these capabilities internally during the establishment of their platform ecosystems as part of larger transformational journeys. To address this gap, we conduct a multiple case study of three incumbent organizations, drawing on a dynamic capability lens. We identify 11 practical microfoundations of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities that aided three incumbents in establishing their IoT platform ecosystems. Besides the transformational activities, our findings contribute to the literature on platform establishment through three IoT-related shifts that deviate from known digital platform paradigms.","","","",""

These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge.","","Analytical models;Digital twin;Tools;Regulation;DSL;Computer security;Vehicle dynamics;automotive;cybersecurity;testing;digital twin;model-based testing","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Marksteiner2021.pdf",""

However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.","","autonomous systems, unpredictable circumstances, systems engineering, robustness, trustworthiness, unexpected events, software engineering","",""

Societal, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainability have become increasingly important design criteria in developing future technologies, along with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework that sets specific goals and targets to be achieved by 2030. The role of mobile communications is important in supporting nations and organizations in meeting the UN SDGs in a timely manner, but the whole ICT sector itself, with its critical role as the backbone of society, can create a significant sustainability burden. Research on the next-generation mobile communication networks (6G) has started, aiming at first deployments in 2030, in a new era where sustainability defines its development. Therefore, sustainability, especially through the UN SDGs, and the future 6G wireless networks, cannot be treated in isolation, but a clear connection between them is urgently needed. This paper extends from traditional green communications and energy efficiency considerations in wireless communications to establishing a close connection between 6G and the triple bottom line of economic sustainability, societal sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The paper outlines open research challenges for sustainable 6G development and provides a set of research questions encouraging especially the researchers and engineers in the wireless and mobile communications community to address to realize a sustainable future.","","","",""

Their critical analysis in terms of regional scalability is provided. The authors present the approach to building the digitalization index of Russian regions. The index measures the level of digitalization in a region by 48 parameters, grouped into three main groups: “perception of the processes of digital transformation of the subject of the Russian Federation, “preparedness of the digital environment, and “effects of digital transformation for the economy and social sphere of the region. The rating provides monitoring, evaluation of development, manageability, efficiency, and effectiveness in the context of interests and involvement of the main participants in the digital transformation process. The main participants in the digital transformation process are the following: authorities (states); representatives of the business community; citizens of the Russian Federation. A feature of the proposed approach is the accounting, when determining subject areas and composition of indicators and strategic priorities of Russia in the field of digitalization. The authors assume that the Index will be used by regional authorities to specify the provisions of regional projects conducted in the framework of federal projects of the national program “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation. Furthermore, the Index will be used to monitor its progress in the field of digital development and analyze problematic issues in the implementation of the digitalization strategy in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.","","","",""

Through explorative design science and systematic combining, the deployment of a permissionless blockchain system for collecting product life-cycle data is conceptualized, demonstrated, and evaluated by experts. The purpose of the blockchain-based solution is to manage product data interactions, to maintain an accurate single state of product information, and to provide an economic incentive structure for the provision and the deployment of the solution. The evaluation by knowledgeable researchers and practitioners identifies the aspects limiting blockchain-based deployment of solutions in the current industrial landscape.

Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less ``digital twins″ for industrial IOT applications.

In addition to others, there are many gaps in current systems engineering (SE) security design processes, and there is a need to reevaluate how we design systems in response to real and potential security threats. Systems that were developed without any consideration of operational threats now are being disrupted, and systems are being used by threat actors in ways that were never intended uses of the system. Thus the consideration of system response to threats in the development phase has become a necessary process across many domains that have no experience with safe and secure design strategies. Uncertainty and rapid change in the threat environment and future threat scenarios prevent a requirements-driven and model-based design process that produces dynamic design strategies and solutions. Future systems need to be designed for agility in response to context-driven changes, resilience to threat intrusions and cascading failure modes, and the ability to gracefully degrade and/or self-heal in response to unintended use. Methods and tools must support greenfield (new) and brownfield (existing) implementations.  Through a series of workshops organized by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) that brought together distinguished systems engineering researchers and professionals from across the United States, this paper documents the identification and synthesis of research gaps in the area of systems engineering as related to security and safety. These include research needs related to improved system protection; agility and adaptation; modeling and simulation of systems that reflect the adaptive behavior of internal and external actors; SE methods and tools that are self-descriptive and capture real-world information/data; tools that infer potentially unsafe, vulnerable, and/or non-secure implementations; mechanisms for self-governance and self-healing; and an ethics framework for design trades. From these gaps and related future needs, relevant stakeholders and preliminary research topics and threads are identified, and a roadmap is put forward for future research to address these Grand Challenges.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\McDermott2019.pdf",""

As digitally enabled manufacturing machines continue to grow exponentially, it becomes imperative to uniquely and securely identify them in the cyber-physical world, particularly in defense, biomedical, energy and aerospace manufacturing. Research about threats originating from internal adversaries’ i.e the machine/organization owner within a tiered digitally connected supply chain is scarce. This paper introduces a machine fingerprinting scheme named as the ‘Witness Box Protocol’ (WBP) that exploits the physical properties of manufacturing machines (legacy or smart) and their surroundings to create a unique biometric like fingerprint. WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. In this research, fingerprints were randomly generated from the statistical features of signals from 3D printers and CNC machine in a production-like lab environment. Using k-means clustering and Jaccard similarity index, these fingerprints are shown to identify the source equipment with 95 % accuracy.","","Cybersecurity, Smart manufacturing, Manufacturing fingerprinting, Cyber physical systems, Digital supply Chain traceability","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Mehdi2020.pdf",""

Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Melesse2021.pdf",""

The ID study considers the elements of the Industry 4.0 (I4) such as autonomous robots, advanced analytics, systems integration, high-end sensing, big data, internet of things, cloud computing and human-machine interactions. Toward achievable I4-based production, the proposed IDoI4 (ID-of-I4) approach integrates I4 fundamental elements regarding a) modelling and solution algorithms (MSA), b) information and communication technologies (ICT), c) high-performance computing (HPC), and d) mechatronics (MEC). These four groups of the I4 elements are examined in the industrial cases covering from mature industries to laboratory level systems to determine their current technological states and gaps into the I4 stage. The examples highlighted are crushed-ore stockpile level control in the mining field, resin bed cleaning timetabling in water demineralisation treatment, compositional data-driven real-time optimisation of hydrocarbon streams and diverse I4 basics in the next generation of biorefineries. In the main example, supported by a high-end sensing apparatus to measure crushed-ore stockpile levels in real-time (live inventory as a controlled variable by a target), a hybrid dynamic control prescribes (every 4 minutes) discrete positions and time-slots of the shuttle-conveyor tripper car mechatronics that creates the stockpiles. From such IDoI4 methodology, a table on the MSA, ICT, HPC and MEC ground bases summarises how such technologies are integrated to the industrial examples considering research, development and deployment in stable, demanded and highly demanded stages of the technologies into the I4 mandate.","","Industry 4.0, Smart manufacturing systems, High-end sensing, Advanced analytics","",""

To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life.

In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.","","Networking, KDN, SDN, Modeling, ML","",""

Todays embedded system such as iPhones and smart watches have integrated hardware and software solutions. There are engineering methodologies available to develop such embedded systems, focusing on the system. While their use at a personal level is much understood, what is less understood, and a topic of ongoing research is the question of what happens when such systems are deployed across multiple sectors, such as intelligent transportation systems, Internet of Things, smart medical devices, and many more, and used in activities not originally intended by the designers, for example, controlling the physical devices such as an automobile or an electricity power generation plant. This cross-sector deployment and the collective use of such systems introduces risk at the macro-system level that may have cascaded impacts in a highly networked environment, which further impact the constituent systems themselves. This is a major problem. One possibility to reduce the technical risk is to remotely control the systems in the cyber environments, but the sheer number of variables and possible situations introduce complexity at multiple scales. This complexity results in test plans with limited coverage. Additional cyber physical system related issues of intelligence, adaptation, autonomy, and security make the problem even worse. The proposed solution is the enhanced use of Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The M&S discipline has supported the development of complex systems since its inception. This chapter provides an overview on the M&S methods and technologies that aid CPS engineering in the development and testing phases, and CPS governance when they are deployed in complex cyber environments.","","autonomy aspects, complex cyber environments, cyber physical systems engineering, modeling and simulation methods, systems theory","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Mittal2019a.pdf",""

The popular yet relatively poorly recognized scientific concept revolutionizes production strategies of enterprises. This prompts many researchers to analyze the real status of knowledge using a systematic literature review. In contrast to the available foreign publications, the existing analysis shows the lack of an analogous outcome on the domestic market. A systematic review of the literature made it possible to answer the following questions: (1) How widespread is the concept of Industry 4.0 in the Polish literature? (2) Which of the mentioned areas of the Industry 4.0 concept are particularly eagerly explored by researchers in Poland? (3) What research directions should the scientists focus on in the future?

The core of digital transformation is the confluence of at least four essential technologies: Cloud Computing, Big Data, the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence. Through Cloud Computing, a new generation of Artificial Intelligence is being applied in an increasing number of applications with stunning results. Beside this the Internet of Things connects devices in value chains across industry and infrastructure and generating terabytes of data every day, which result in the Big Data paradigm. The digital transformation of the mentioned technological wave will also have a huge impact on the circular economy, a new paradigm in today’s public and private discussion to reduce the greenhouse effect.

From a service integrator viewpoint, building new solutions for these environments, which can host a large number of externally designed and developed micro-services, is often complex and error-prone. This is in part due to undocumented behaviour or undocumented architectural specifications of such systems. Advanced service monitoring can offer a solution to quickly detect anomalies or unexpected service interaction behaviour during on-site integration. However, the monitoring service should not have an impact on the production environment itself. Therefore, this article proposes an agent-based unobtrusive monitoring platform, capable of monitoring both internally developed and externally developed services through the use of sidecar containers. It monitors state, metrics and network traffic at micro-service level and the research was conducted as part of the DynAMo research project, a collaboration with various industry partners. Prototype evaluation proves that our solution has a negligible impact (below 0.02% CPU usage on average) on an existing micro-service environment just as other monitoring systems like Prometheus while offering additional functionality focused on multi-vendor service integration. This makes it suitable to be deployed in complex production domains to further aid on-site integration and quickly find potential new anomalies.","","Docker, sidecar containers, unobtrusive monitoring","",""

With the decline in demand, supply, and workforce the industries are driven into the gloom. The concerned research objective is to explore the factors which impact manufacturing throughout the world during the epidemic of Covid-19. Further, it delineates the usage of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), and internet of things (IoT) to bring on solutions/approaches to evolving to pandemic-constrained manufacturing. An overall of twelve key factors is determined from extensive literature reviews which are categorized into challenges and solutions. Here, ISM methodology has been used to establish the interrelationship among identified twelve challenges and solutions. Further, MICMAC analysis has categorized them according to their driving and dependence power. The consequences display the absence of autonomous factors whilst efficient supply chain, centralized decision making, product diversification, and JIT along with revenue generation turn out to be significant dependant factors. The facilitators like digital technologies are the pre-cursors to the ultimate solution of revenue generation and termed preliminary solutions. The outcomes of this research will suggest eventual policy recommendations for industry leaders to progress manufacturing within Covid-19 constraints. It will offer a sturdy base for manufacturers around the world to tune to the new digital transformation of the production scenario.","","COVID-19, Manufacturing performance, Digital technology, ISM","",""

In the UK a 5-year planning period and investment cycle called the Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the regulatory mechanism. This process is used to manage a water utility’s infrastructure and other assets to deliver an agreed standard of service. The challenge of AMP 6 and 7 (to 2025) and beyond is to maximise efficiency by moving from reactive to proactive management. This can be achieved by using data, information and (where possible) control of the system. The more intelligence that is captured, the more that can be learned and understood about the network and subsequently be predicted. Extra data provides new opportunities for asset maintenance and event analytics. Data science is an emerging discipline which combines analysis, programming and business knowledge and uses new and advanced techniques and technologies to work with complex data. The water sector needs to address the issue of ‘big data’ and obtaining ‘signal from the noise’. Primarily, the focus is on data to action by the application of data science.  The role of digitalisation for smart water networks is covered in this chapter, exploring issues of IoT, artificial intelligence, blockchain and other novel technologies. Reference to case studies demonstrates the type of applications which will become increasingly common place. Some recommendations based on future possibilities and opportunities are proposed.","","","",""

This paper focuses on the improvement of IoT cybersecurity from an ontological analysis, proposing appropriate security services adapted to the threats. The authors propose an ontology-based cybersecurity framework using knowledge reasoning for IoT, composed of two approaches: (1) design time, which provides a dynamic method to build security services through the application of a model-driven methodology considering the existing enterprise processes; and (2) run time, which involves monitoring the IoT environment, classifying threats and vulnerabilities, and actuating in the environment ensuring the correct adaptation of the existing services. Two validation approaches demonstrate the feasibility of our concept.

In this paper, we investigated the possibilities of using synthetic datasets, generated from Virtual Environments (VE) for training and validation of CNN models. We present two use cases where the above-mentioned circumstances play a vital role in preparing the datasets and validating the model with large-scale datasets. By developing and leveraging a three-dimensional Digital Twin (DT), we produce large scale datasets for validating social distancing in workspaces; and in the context of semi-autonomous vehicles, we evaluate how a CNN-based object detection model would perform in an Indian road scenario.","","Digital Twins, CNN, Synthetic Data, Object Detection","",""

This paper presents an approach to guarantee security of C2PS using concepts from Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to describe the security properties of cloud constructs. We prove that composability is an essential property for enhancing the security of the C2PS. Furthermore, it also provides good scalability to the system. We propose formalisms required for modelling security properties in the Industrial IoT-based manufacturing system. Using this formalism and Hoares’ logic we provide conditions for composing systems. Finally, we provide strong authentication conditions among entity pairs in C2PS based manufacturing systems.

Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.","","simulation methods, distributed simulation, Supply chain management, review","",""

The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin—a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system’s performance.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Mykoniatis2021.pdf",""

However, when it comes to collaborative data processing in scientific workflows, provenance information of the used data is not always accessible. Especially in complex data ecosystems with multiple decentralized data sources, it is hard to keep track of the processing operations once they are completed. When sharing such data between different researchers and other involved parties, poor traceability of processing steps may also obstruct this process. In this paper, we introduce a blockchain based data provenance information system, which enables decentralized sharing of this information. We then integrate this system into the decentralized data sources context and address trust and traceability issues in the network with an identity-based solution. Furthermore, the system’s performance is evaluated, and the concept is examined in a case study on the e-Maritime Integrated Reference Platform (eMIR).","","","",""

Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Technologies, manufacturing industries are witnessing the fourth Industrial Revolution, coined as Industrie 4.0 (I4.0). Although many studies related to this subject were published, including several literature reviews, there is no consensual definition of I4.0. Consequently, there is not a clear understanding of the underlying enabling technologies required to implement it. That makes it more difficult for players to plan a migration strategy. This paper proposes a technological pathway infrastructure from Industry 3.0 (I3.0) to I4.0, based on the analysis of research and academic involvement in this transition process. A bibliometric study was directed to academic work, while field research addressed industry practitioners. The purpose of field research is to understand the impact of the knowledge about the transition from I3.0 up to I4.0. The contribution of this study includes a construct showing the fundamental technology infrastructure to pave the way from I3.0 up to I4.0. Furthermore, it reveals the transition of manufacturing paradigm from I3.0 complex, centralized, monolithic architecture and physical Supply Chain to a modular, distributed, collaborative, and product-service-oriented I4.0 architecture.","","Paradigm shift in industrial automation, IoT, Collaborative network, Industry 4.0, Industrial internet, Intelligent manufacturing","",""

The state-of-the-art review of the entire scholarship of Industry 4.0 demonstrates three broad clusters—the implications of automation on industry, the integration of technologies and technological advancements driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The scholarship output is, for the first time, compared with the leading industrial and policymaking institutional reports to highlight similarities and discrepancies. This allows to propose a previously unavailable definition of Industry 4.0, which is much needed to progress the research further. The three highly discrepant areas between academic literature and industry insights include lack of research into return on investment, lack of research involving policymaking, and the implications of technological development on the workforce, firms and countries. It is imperative to drive research into the existent, as well as the highlighted, themes in advancing the knowledge and aligning the academic scholarship with the interests of practitioners.","","Fourth Industrial Revolution, Industry 4.0, science mapping, scientometrics, systematic review","",""

These aspects are discussed, reflecting on the requirements of introducing such a technology in a broader way. Machine learning, as subfield of artificial intelligence, benefits from advances in Big Data science. One example is the   λ -architecture which can be used for the treatment of streamed process data in industrial applications. Digital twins are shown as further tool providing object-oriented data for machine learning applications. Yet, the increasing freedom of data transfer within a plant, as propagated by Industry 4.0, poses new risks for information technology and automation systems: security of those components is one of the big challenges. Here, artificial intelligence can seen as both risk and solution. A last relevant challenge is acceptance among the staff, as artificial intelligence is associated with fears. Counterstrategies for those fears are presented as a proposed guideline for real applications. Finally, current frontiers at process industry are considered and discussed. These include the need for strengthening the use of high-dimensional data availability, increased roll-out of optimisation concepts and rigorous progresses in semantic modelling of processes and process chains, in order to fully exploit the beneficial scope of artificial intelligence in industry.","","","",""

Although automation and assistance technologies are becoming more prevalent in production and logistics, there is consensus that humans will remain an essential part of operations systems. Nevertheless, human factors are still underrepresented in this research stream resulting in an important research and application gap. This article first exposes this gap by presenting the results of a focused content analysis of earlier research on Industry 4.0. To contribute to closing this gap, it then develops a conceptual framework that integrates several key concepts from the human factors engineering discipline that are important in the context of Industry 4.0 and that should thus be considered in future research in this area. The framework can be used in research and development to systematically consider human factors in Industry 4.0 designs and implementations. This enables the analysis of changing demands for humans in Industry 4.0 environments and contributes towards a successful digital transformation that avoid the pitfalls of innovation performed without attention to human factors. The paper concludes with highlighting future research directions on human factors in Industry 4.0 as well as managerial implications for successful applications in practice.","","Human factors, Ergonomics, Industry 4.0, Digital transformation, Content analysis, System design","",""

Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones can be used to complete a wide range of different tasks from the military to the industry with numerous studies available in the literature. However, the broad use of drones for smart cities also faces several technical, societal issues such as cybersecurity, privacy, and public safety that need to be concerned. This chapter briefly provides a general overview of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks through a meta-analysis of relevant literature review towards drones such as Wi-Fi security, drone networking security, malicious software, and the like. Moreover, several countermeasures are explained in this chapter including detection methods and defense mechanisms to protect drones from their security vulnerabilities. Importantly, this paper raises cybersecurity awareness for users and presents solutions for future research in this area of interest. In fact, most cybersecurity vulnerabilities are based on sensors, communication links, and privacy via photos. Therefore, to ensure the security of drones, there is a need for a combination of the solutions for multiple sensors, the use of safe communication links instead of Wi-Fi, and the application of the CIA triad concepts.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Nguyen2021.pdf",""

Digital twin (DT), referring to the virtual representation of a physical object, is well-perceived as a key driver in the development of PI-based Supply Chain Management (SCM). Due to the capabilities of real-time monitoring and evaluation of large-scale complex systems, significant research efforts have been made to exploit values of PI/DT in SCM. Despite this, the current literature remained largely unstructured and scattered due to a lack of systematic literature reviews to synergise research findings, analyse the evolution of research fronts and extract emerging trends in the field. To address this issue, the paper deploys a bibliometric knowledge mapping approach to provide a bird's eye view of the current research status in the PI/DT-SCM area. Using CiteSpace's keyword co-occurrence network, 518 journal articles are clustered into 10 key research streams on PI/DT applications in: job shop scheduling, smart manufacturing design, PI-based SCM, manufacturing virtualisation, information management, sustainability development, data analytics, manufacturing operations management, simulation and optimisation, and assembly process planning. Based on citation burst rate, keywords representing research frontiers of the PI/DT are detected and their temporal evolutions are discussed. Likewise, some identified emerging research trends are production process and system, robotics, computer architecture, and cost. Finally, seven future research directions are suggested, which emphasise on several PI/DT-related issues, including business ecosystem, sustainability development, SC downstream management, cognitive thinking in Industry 5.0, citizen twin in digital society, and SC resilience.","","","",""

A number of previous works showed significant progress on security effectiveness evaluation for MTD mechanisms. While, a lesser amount of studies considered the impact of running MTD mechanisms on system dependability metrics, exposing a critical missing on the comprehension of pros and cons of MTD mechanisms in terms of security and dependability. In this paper, we present comprehensive modelling and analysis of time-based switch-over MTD strategies complying with IP shuffling techniques deployed in a Software Defined Network (SDN) using stochastic reward net (SRN). To investigate the impact of MTD strategies along with system availability on service performance metrics, we propose performability SRN models for various switch-over MTD strategies. The modelled behaviours of the switch-over MTD strategies are based on the integration of service management policies (drop/accept) with time-based switch-over policies (zero-time, fixed-time, and variable-time waiting policies) Critical performability metrics are comprehensively evaluated, including (i) system availability, downtime minutes, and Capacity-oriented Availability (COA) of a service, (ii) service throughput, (iii) response time of a job, (iv) average utilization of a server, (v) number of lost jobs, and (vi) operational cost (power consumption and business profit loss). The analysis results reveal sophisticated operational system behaviours and the impact of MTD strategies on system performability metrics. This study can help design and plan the development and adoption of MTD strategies in practice regarding the trade-offs between security and performability assurance.","","Moving Target Defence, Software Defined Network, Performability, Stochastic reward net","",""

The present study develops an index of composite on-farm environmental impacts (COEI) as a proxy measure to evaluate ESA and validates the index by mapping interactions amongst agriculture related environmental impacts and potential constraints to practice ESA by using the directed graph approach. The cost of mitigation to practice ESA was calculated by estimating the cost of reducing on-farm environmental impacts by using the damage–cost method. The approach was empirically applied to a sample of 317 High Yielding Variety (HYV) rice farms from three intensive rice-growing regions of northwestern Bangladesh. Results showed that the use of chemical pesticides contributed towards higher level of uncertainty in practicing ESA than the use of chemical fertilizers, irrigation and household pollution. The combined effect of the influence from these factor interactions was estimated at 2.3, which falls in the critical region of influence and implies extreme level of uncertainty in practicing ESA. The cost of mitigating negative environmental impacts is higher for the problems of ‘decline in soil fertility’, ‘increases in crop diseases’ and ‘reduction in fish catch’ as compared to other soil and water related impacts. Policy implications include investments in addressing the problems of ‘soil fertility decline’, ‘increases in crop diseases’ and ‘reduction in fish catch’ and raising farmers’ awareness on using farm chemicals to promote ESA practices for HYV rice production.","","","",""

Remedial actions and structural programmes should take into account, e.g., the level of work safety in all European Union (EU) countries. Aim: the identification of differences in the level of work safety in the production sector of EU countries, especially the so-called “old and “new EU countries. (2) Methods: for each country UE (in 2008–2018), the relative risk (RR) of an accident at work was determined and a comparative analysis was conducted. (3) Results: an increase in the RR of an accident at work was observed along with an increase in the GDP of a given country. It was found that the level of occupational safety in Sweden and the United Kingdom is higher than in other countries, and lower in Spain and Portugal. In the three largest economies of the EU, Germany, France, and Italy, the RR of the accident in the industrial sector in relation to the national data is one of the lowest in the entire EU, not exceeding 1.3. In The Netherlands, an increase of 1.7 RR of fatal accidents in the industrial sector was observed between 2008 and 2018. (4) Conclusions: RR in the manufacturing sector of the so-called “old EU is higher than in the so-called “new EU, which may result from the implementation of Industry 4.0 assumptions in the “old EU. The presented results and conclusions may be useful in shaping the EU policy in the field of sustainable development of production sectors of individual member countries.","","","",""

Methodologies for PHM are either model-driven, data-driven or a fusion of both approaches. Data-driven approaches make extensive use of large-scale datasets collected from physical assets to identify underlying failure mechanisms and root causes. In recent years, many data-driven PHM models have been developed to evaluate system’s health conditions using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to condition monitoring data. The field of AI is fast gaining acceptance in various areas of applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and smart devices. With advancements in the use of AI technologies in Industry 4.0, where systems consist of multiple interconnected components in a cyber–physical space, there is increasing pressure on industries to move towards more predictive and proactive maintenance practices. In this paper, a thorough state-of-the-art review of the AI techniques adopted for PHM of engineering systems is conducted. Furthermore, given that the future of inspection and maintenance will be predominantly AI-driven, the paper discusses the soft issues relating to manpower, cyber-security, standards and regulations under such a regime. The review concludes that the current systems and methodologies for maintenance will inevitably become incompatible with future designs and systems; as such, continued research into AI-driven prognostics systems is expedient as it offers the best promise of bridging the potential gap.","","Prognostics and health management (PHM), Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML), Predictive maintenance, Algorithm, Remaining useful life (RUL), Engineering systems","",""

Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user’s behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data—Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer—are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.","","experimental infrastructure, user emulation, data driven, data sets","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Oesch2021.pdf",""

However, a fundamental challenge of C-CNC is how to guarantee safety and reliability of machine control given variable Internet quality of service (e.g. delays), especially on public Internet networks.

Automating the process of capturing data from industrial machines, analyzing it and using the knowledge gained to make better decisions for the machines is the crux of the digital twin. Sensor technology, Internet of Things platforms, information and communication technology and smart analytics allow the digital twin to transform a physical asset into a connected smart item that is now part of a cyber physical system and that is far more valuable than when it existed in isolation. The digital twin can be adopted by the maintenance engineering industry to aid in the prediction of issues before they occur thus creating value for the business. In this paper the authors look to introduce a maintenance digital twin to a large-scale manufacturing facility. Issues that hamper such work are discovered and categorized to highlight the difficulty of the practical installation of this concept. To aid in the installation process a digital twin framework is presented that simplifies the digital twin development process into steps that can be completed independently. With the framework in place the authors commence the task of completing these steps.","","Digital Twin, Predicitve Maintenance","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\O’Sullivan2020.pdf",""

This would be done by benefiting from knowledge and experience of humans, and balancing in a reactive way some complex or complicated tasks with intelligent systems. Several studies already dealt with such an objective, but few are done at a methodological level, which forbids, for example, the correct evaluation of design choices in terms of human awareness of the situation or mental workload when designing intelligent manufacturing systems integrating the human. Indeed, increasing the intelligence and autonomy of industrial systems and their composing entities (resources, products, robots…), as fostered by Industry 4.0, increases their overall complexity. This modification reduces the ability to understand the behaviors of these systems, and leads to the difficulty for humans not only to elaborate alternative decisions when required, but also to make effective decisions and understand their consequences. This paper evaluates such a design methodology, the Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), and its applicability when designing an assistance system to support Human in the control of Intelligent Manufacturing System in Industry 4.0. Among several functions identified through the application of CWA, the assistant system might have to integrate a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. The evaluation of the methodology through the one of the designed assistant systems is done using a micro-world, which is an intelligent manufacturing cell composed of intelligent mobile ground robots, products, and static production robots interacting together and with a human supervisor in charge of the reaching of several time-based and energy-based performances indicators. The assistant system embeds a digital twin of the intelligent manufacturing system. Twenty-three participants took part in experiments to evaluate the designed assistance system. First results show that the assistance system enables participants to have a correct awareness of the situation and a correct evaluation of their alternative decisions, while their mental workload is managed and expected production performances are reached. This paper contains an analysis of these experiments and points out some limits of the CWA method in the context of Industry 4.0, especially the lack of tool enabling to specify clearly the cooperation processes between the supervisor and the intelligent manufacturing system. This paper concludes with potential research avenues, the main one being the potential benefits of coupling CWA with human–machine cooperation principles to fine tune and adapt the cooperation between the human and the intelligent manufacturing system.","","","",""

The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.","","","",""

Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Panetto2019.pdf",""

This paper’s main contribution is to present a host-based intrusion detection system using a C4.5-based detector on top of the popular Consolidated Tree Construction (CTC) algorithm, which works efficiently in the presence of class-imbalanced data. An improved version of the random sampling mechanism called Supervised Relative Random Sampling (SRRS) has been proposed to generate a balanced sample from a high-class imbalanced dataset at the detector’s pre-processing stage. Moreover, an improved multi-class feature selection mechanism has been designed and developed as a filter component to generate the IDS datasets’ ideal outstanding features for efficient intrusion detection. The proposed IDS has been validated with state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems. The results show an accuracy of 99.96% and 99.95%, considering the NSL-KDD dataset and the CICIDS2017 dataset using 34 features.","","","",""

Among the technological portfolio enabling this revolution, the late literature has capitalized on the potential of data analytics for improving the production cycle at different stages, from resource provisioning to planning, delivery and storage. However, such a promising role of data analytics has been so far explored without a proper, quantitative inspection of the cost-improvement trade-off, nor has the process of acquiring sensors and extracting valuable information from their captured data formalized in a series of methodological steps. This paper introduces the Analyze, Sense, Preprocess, Predict, Implement and Deploy (ASPPID) methodology, an iterative decision workflow that spans from the acquisition of sensing equipment to the quantitative assessment of the contribution of their captured data to enhance the production step under focus. By placing the data scientist at the core of the workflow, this methodology helps improvement teams make informed decisions about which parts of the process need to be sensed, and how to exploit this information towards a verifiable improvement of the production cycle. The implementation of this methodology is exemplified in a real use case within the automotive industry, where the detection of defects in an annealing process can be modeled as a classification problem over a highly imbalanced dataset. Results obtained after applying the proposed ASPPID methodology show that the scrap ratio is reduced by sensing the correct part of the process at minimal investment costs, thus highlighting the crucial role of the data scientist in the management team of manufacturing plants.","","Industry 4.0, Methodological data analytics, Process monitoring, Cost efficiency, Imbalanced learning","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Para2019.pdf",""

The microgrid research field is also evolving to enable intelligent operation of energy management through digitalization. Problems occur when operating the actual microgrid, causing issues such as difficulty in decision making and system abnormalities. Using digital twin technology, which is one of the technologies representing the fourth industrial revolution, it is possible to overcome these problems by changing the microgrid configuration and operating algorithms of virtual space in various ways and testing them in real time. In this study, we proposed an energy storage system (ESS) operation scheduling model to be applied to virtual space when constructing a microgrid using digital twin technology. An ESS optimal charging/discharging scheduling was established to minimize electricity bills and was implemented using supervised learning techniques such as the decision tree, NARX, and MARS models instead of existing optimization techniques. NARX and decision trees are machine learning techniques. MARS is a nonparametric regression model, and its application has been increasing. Its performance was analyzed by deriving performance evaluation indicators for each model. Using the proposed model, it was found in a case study that the amount of electricity bill savings when operating the ESS is greater than that incurred in the actual ESS operation. The suitability of the model was evaluated by a comparative analysis with the optimization-based ESS charging/discharging scheduling pattern.","","","",""

In particular, the controller has been presented as a digital twin (DT) concept, which is an increasingly growing method in a variety of applications. In DDPG-NIB-MFC, the pitch angle is considered as the control input that depends on the optimal rotor speed, which is usually derived from effective wind speed. The system stability according to the Lyapunov theory can be achieved by the recursive nature of the backstepping theory and the integral action has been used to compensate for the steady-state error. Moreover, due to the nonlinear characteristics of wind turbines, the MFC aims to handle the un-modeled system dynamics and disturbances. The DDPG algorithm with actor-critic structure has been added in the proposed control structure to efficiently and adaptively tune the controller parameters embedded in the NIB controller. Under this effort, a digital twin of a presented controller is defined as a real-time and probabilistic model which is implemented on the digital signal processor (DSP) computing device. To ensure the performance of the proposed approach and output behavior of the system, software-in-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) testing procedures have been considered. From the simulation and implementation outcomes, it can be concluded that the proposed backstepping controller based DDPG is more effective, robust, and adaptive than the backstepping and proportional-integral (PI) controllers optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances.","","","",""

The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners.","","Servitization, Digital technologies, Digital servitization, Systematic literature review (SLR), Benefits, Research agenda","",""

By simulating the nominal behavior of the system online, i.e., in parallel to the process, and continuously comparing the simulated behavior to the measured values allows to detect attacks. Their localization is facilitated through a root-cause analysis, which is also based on the model description of the plant.

Despite several advances in this domain, the literature still lacks a state-of-the-art review of simulation-based approaches in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This paper therefore aims to provide a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed publications between 2011 and 2018 in the field of modelling and simulation applied in Industry 4.0, with a focus on manufacturing and logistics systems. This review contributes to the literature in two significant ways. First, it provides a broad coverage of current publications on the theme by reviewing 112 papers, using a meta-analysis approach. Moreover, it presents a detailed evaluation of different elements from these publications, including research activities (application area, methods, frameworks and software tools), gaps and directions. Around 80% of the papers analysed were published in the last two years. Finally, the results suggest that the main simulation approaches used in Industry 4.0 are agent-based or mixed methods and identify Digital Twin (DT) as the most promising simulation technology.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\PaulaFerreira2021.pdf",""

As cloud becomes the basis of most innovative manufacturing IT systems, its future role in Cyber-physical Production Systems has to be properly investigated, as their interoperability will play a role of vital importance. In this paper, after a brief introduction to cloud criticality and cloud-based manufacturing, the mutual conceptual similarities in modelling distributed industrial services of two of the major standardization frameworks for industrial Internet architectures are presented: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) and the Reference Architectural Model Industrie (RAMI 4.0). It is also introduced how their integration feasibility finds a strong affinity in specifications of the Open Connectivity Unified Architecture, a service-oriented architecture candidate to the standardization of Industrial Internet of Things based manufacturing platforms.

As the utilities sector undergoes sea change driven by technological progress, institutional reform and sustainability concerns, longstanding business models are rapidly becoming obsolete and established players are facing growing challenges to their role. In this effervescent, increasingly contended market environment, an extraordinary wealth of business opportunities opens up for companies of all sorts—from large energy firms to local utilities embarking on growth paths via alliances and aggregations, to startups and new entrants from side industries. After reviewing the key technologies impacting the sector and the main pillars of the EU energy policy, the paper delineates three macro-roles for future energy firms. It then stresses the function that smart grids, new digital capabilities, and market segmentation will have in redrawing the structure of the sector. Finally, it suggests that while a balanced mix of old and new technologies is likely to be around and even winning for some time to come, companies that resist innovation and change may soon find themselves as belonging to the past.","","","",""

However, the impact of these transformations exceeds the production systems themselves; rather, they affect the entire value chain, from the product design and development process (PDDP) through manufacturing and supply-chain management to marketing and disposal. As the new PDDP to a large extent defines the value chain for a company, the challenge lies in ensuring that the designed product will help the company fully benefit from the IRs. By analysing the 4th IR, the authors reveal that few publications shed light on this aspect. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to establish features and properties that will shape the PDDP throughout the 4th IR and into a smart design engineering. To accomplish this, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature, which provides ten findings. These findings are then analysed by 11 specialists both from academia and the industry, and the findings’ relations to the 4th IR and their impact on the product development process is discussed. By establishing these findings, this paper provides a platform for the understanding of what could potentially shape smart design engineering and its design-related activities.","","","",""

This is beyond the capabilities of traditional systems based on MRP and ERP, since the information should be managed in a flexible and decentralized way to exploit the Smart Manufacturing facilities of Industry 4.0.

Consequently, we explore the potential of blockchain as an information technology able to support industries that base their business models on mass customized/personalized production processes. This survey allows us to identify important challenges for further developments, highlighting three issues in the production setting: (i) to deepen the interoperability of systems, (ii) to generate more implementations, and (iii) to develop efficient consensus protocols. As a response to these insights we provide a conceptual design of how blockchain contributes to managing efficiently mass customized production systems. In our design the information of customer specifications can be fused with data from the production process to generate a plan to fulfill the demand.

This paper presents research among civil servants, suppliers and experts who play a role in the automation of spatial policymaking and planning (e.g. environment, building, sound and CO2 regulation, mobility). The case is a major digitalisation programme of that spatial planning in the Netherlands. In this digital transition, the research assumption is that public and political values such as transparency, legitimacy and (perceived) fairness are difficult to validate in the practice of the design process; policy makers tend to lose sight of the algorithms and decision trees designed during the ICT -implementation of eGovernment services. This situation would implicate a power shift towards the system level bureaucrat. i.e., the digitized execution of laws and regulations, thereby threatening democratic control. This also sets the stage for anxiety towards ICT projects and digital bureaucracies. We have investigated perceptions about ‘validation dark spots’ in the design process of the national planning platform that create unintended shifts in decision power in the context of the legal planning process. To identify these validation dark spots, 22 stakeholders were interviewed. The results partially confirm the assumption. Based on the collected data, nine validation dark spots are identified that require more attention and research.","","","",""

The implementation of these CPSs creates several changes for companies’ operations that are expected to have a deep impact in human workers. A lack of studies on the social impact of the use of CPSs has been identified and, through a comprehensive literature review, this work aims at contributing for this discussion by defining a questionnaire about the topic.

Moreover, an industrial control system facing information security problems in recent times because of the nature of IoT which affects the evaluation of abnormal predication.

The first section of proposed IoT-HML system is to introduce the cat induced wheel optimization (IWO) algorithm for cluster formation. The process consists of clustering and cluster head (CH) selection. The source node forward information to destination through CH only which avoids the unwanted data loss and improve the security, because the information travel through trusted path. For route selection process, we utilize the cuckoo search algorithm to compute the optimal best path among multiples.

Attacks against enterprises are often monetary driven and are targeted to compromise data. While the best practices in enterprise-level cyber security of IT infrastructures are well established, the same cannot be said for critical infrastructures that exist in the manufacturing industry. Often guided by these best practices, manufacturing enterprises apply blanket cyber security in order to protect their networks, resulting in either under or over protection. In addition, these networks comprise heterogeneous entities such as machinery, control systems, digital twins and interfaces to the external supply chain making them susceptible to cyber attacks that cripple the manufacturing enterprise. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse, comprehend and quantify the essential metrics of providing targeted and optimised cyber security for manufacturing enterprises. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to develop the essential metrics, namely, Damage Index (DI) and Vulnerability Index (VI) that quantify the extent of damage a manufacturing enterprise could suffer due to a cyber attack and the vulnerabilities of the heterogeneous entities within the enterprise respectively. A use case for computing the metrics is also demonstrated.

Hence, they integrate human, cyber, and physical elements. Since MCPSs are life-critical and context-aware, they are significant to the healthcare industry, which is prone to data breaches and cyber-attacks. As an emerging research area, MCPS faces several challenges with respect to system reliability, assurance, autonomy and security, and privacy. In this paper, we initially examine the state-of-the-arts of MCPS over the last few decades (1998–2020) and subsequently propose a new framework considering security/privacy for MPCS that incorporates several models that depict various domains of security. An interaction between various models followed with a qualitative assessment of the framework has been carried out to present a detailed description of the proposed framework. It is useful in various healthcare industries like health care services, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, etc. that utilize smart devices. Additionally, the framework may be applied to enhance security in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. It may be also useful to deploy efficient workflow operations for patients under the consideration framework. The framework will also lay out the foundation for implementing cybersecurity infrastructures in many healthcare applications.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Priyadarshini2021.pdf",""

Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders’ needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.","","Digital manufacturing, Digital thread, Industry 4.0, SDPD","",""

One noteworthy factor and fact is that there are fresh data sources emerging and pouring out a lot of usable and reusable data. With the number of different, distributed, and decentralized data sources is consistently on the rise, the resulting data scope, size, structure, schema, and speed are greatly changing and challenging too. The other dominant and prominent aspects include polyglot microservices are solidifying deeply as the new building and deployment/execution block in the software world toward the much-needed accelerated software design, development, deployment, and delivery. The device ecosystem expands frenetically with the arrival of trendy and handy, slim and sleek, disappearing and disposable gadgets, gizmos thereby ubiquitous (anywhere, anytime, and any device) access, and usage of web-scale information, content, and services get fructified. Finally, all sorts of casually found and cheap articles in our everyday environments (homes, hotels, hospitals, etc.) are being systematically digitized and service enabled in order to exhibit a kind of real-world smartness and sagacity in their individual as well as collective actions and reactions. Thus trillions of digitized objects, billions of connected devices, and millions of polyglot software services are bound to interact insightfully with one another over locally as well as with remote ones over any networks purposefully. And hence the amount of transactional, operational, analytical, commercial, social, personal, and professional data created through a growing array of interactions and collaborations is growing very rapidly. Now if the data getting collected, processed, and stocked are not subjected to deeper, deft, and decisive investigations, then the tactically as well as strategically sound knowledge (the beneficial patterns, tips, techniques, associations, alerts, risk factors, fresh opportunities, possibilities, etc.) hidden inside the data heaps goes unused literally. For collecting, stocking, and processing such a large amount of multistructured data, the traditional databases, analytics platforms, the ETL tools, etc., are found insufficient. Hence the Apache Hadoop ecosystem technologies and tools are being touted as the best way forward to squeeze out the right and relevant knowledge. In this chapter, you can find the details about the emerging technologies and platforms for spearheading the big data movement.","","Big data analytics (BDA), Hybrid clouds, Hadoop, Knowledge discovery and dissemination, Decision enablement, The Internet of Things (IoT), Apache Spark (batch processing) and Spark Streaming, HDFS storage, Kafka message queue/broker, NoSQL databases","",""

Data generated from IoT devices is sent to the Cloud Computing (CC) for processing and storage, despite the latency caused by the distance. Because of the revolution in IoT devices, data sent to CC has been increasing. As a result, another problem added to the latency was increasing congestion on the cloud network. Fog Computing (FC) was used to solve these problems because of its proximity to IoT devices, while filtering data is sent to the CC. FC is a middle layer located between IoT devices and the CC layer. Due to the massive data generated by IoT devices on FC, Dynamic Weighted Round Robin (DWRR) algorithm was used, which represents a load balancing (LB) algorithm that is applied to schedule and distributes data among fog servers by reading CPU and memory values of these servers in order to improve system performance. The results proved that DWRR algorithm provides high throughput which reaches 3290 req/sec at 919 users. A lot of research is concerned with distribution of workload by using LB techniques without paying much attention to Fault Tolerance (FT), which implies that the system continues to operate even when fault occurs. Therefore, we proposed a replication FT technique called primary-backup replication based on dynamic checkpoint interval on FC. Checkpoint was used to replicate new data from a primary server to a backup server dynamically by monitoring CPU values of primary fog server, so that checkpoint occurs only when the CPU value is larger than 0.2 to reduce overhead. The results showed that the execution time of data filtering process on the FC with a dynamic checkpoint is less than the time spent in the case of the static checkpoint that is independent on the CPU status.","","","",""

The digital transformation has reshaped the manufacturing industries and has paved the way towards data-driven, intelligent, networked, and resilient manufacturing systems. In this context, Industry 4.0 is progressing exponentially and offers a productive output in terms of circular economy and cleaner production to attain ethical business by achieving accuracy, precision, and efficiency. Hence, there is a strong requirement to revamp the traditional manufacturing set-ups into smart manufacturing to gain self-adaptability, reliability, and flexibility with high quality and low-cost output. The paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for Industry 4.0 set-up to achieve circular economy and cleaner production by optimizing products-machine allocation. The proposed MILP model optimizes the trade-off between energy consumption and machine processing cost to gain a circular economy and cleaner production respectively. The proposed model also achieves ethical business by deploying sensors to capture real-time information to establish the Industry 4.0 facility. The paper discusses the product-machine specific analysis to optimize the manufacturing of customized and high-end products at low production cost with minimal energy consumption. The objective of the paper is to minimize the total cost and energy consumption of machines for establishing the Industry 4.0 facility to gain a circular economy and cleaner production. The proposed model is demonstrated and computationally tested on small, moderate, and large data instances and presented with their detailed analysis.","","Industry 4.0, Circular economy, Cleaner production, Ethical business, Energy consumption","",""

These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.","","","",""

In this paper, a novel spectral graph theory (SGT) approach is proposed for resolving the following critical quality assurance concern in AM: how to quantify the relative deviation in dimensional integrity of complex AM components. Here, the SGT approach is demonstrated for classifying the dimensional integrity of standardized test components. The SGT-based topological invariant Fiedler number (λ2) was calculated from 3D point cloud coordinate measurements and used to quantify the dimensional integrity of test components. The Fiedler number was found to differ significantly for parts originating from different AM processes (statistical significance p-val. &lt; 1%). By comparison, prevalent dimensional integrity assessment techniques, such as traditional statistical quantifiers (such as mean and standard deviation) and examination of specific facets/landmarks failed to capture part-to-part variations, and thus proved incapable of ranking the quality of test AM components in a consistent manner. In contrast, the SGT approach was able to consistently rank the quality of the AM components with a high degree of statistical confidence independent of sampling technique used. Consequently, from a practical standpoint, the SGT approach can be a powerful tool for assessing the dimensional integrity of AM components, and thus encourage wider adoption of AM capabilities.","","","",""

However, such assets, if maliciously operated, can become attack entry points and jeopardize the grid operation. Blind and uncoordinated cyber-attacks can be identified by existing security measures overcoming potential operational disruptions. However, rootkit attacks can stay hidden within cyber-physical systems and leverage system information to mask their presence. Rootkit detection is a strenuous process and requires advanced security methods due to their sophisticated operation. A careful analysis of possible rootkit target locations and their exploitation techniques is necessary to design effective threat detection and mitigation mechanisms. This paper discusses the cyber kill chain of a rootkit which can simultaneously deploy itself at multiple locations in a microgrid in a coordinated and stealthy way in order to maximize the impact on power system operations.

In complex manufacturing systems with many digital twins, information must be aggregated, which leads to the requirement for digital twins to interact. Reference architectures for digital twins are required when digital twins from different vendors have to interact. This paper extends the Six-Layer Architecture for Digital Twins (SLADT) to a reference architecture with aggregation (SLADTA). The architecture makes maximum use of vendor-neutral off-the-shelf software, as well as secure and open protocols for twin-to-twin communication.

A key enabler for the advances promised by CPPSs is the concept of a digital twin, which is the virtual representation of a real-world entity, or the physical twin. An important step towards the success of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of practical reference architectures. This paper presents an architecture for such a digital twin, which enables the exchange of data and information between a remote emulation or simulation and the physical twin. The architecture comprises different layers, including a local data layer, an IoT Gateway layer, cloud-based databases and a layer containing emulations and simulations. The architecture can be implemented in new and legacy production facilities, with a minimal disruption of current installations. This architecture provides a service-based and real-time enabled infrastructure for vertical and horizontal integration. To evaluate the architecture, it was implemented for a small, but typical, physical manufacturing system component.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Redelinghuys2020a.pdf",""

IIoT connects sensors, industrial equipment, products, and staff in the factory, enabling context-awareness and industrial equipment automate control. The identity resolution system is a core infrastructure in IIoT. Similar to the role of Domain Name System (DNS) on the Internet, it is the entrance to the IIoT. The difference between them is their input and output. The input of the identity resolution system in IIoT is an identifier of an object. And the output is the mapping data attached to the identifier, including the product profile, a URL, or the identifier's surrounding environment. However, how to deploy an identity resolution system in IIoT has not yet been conclusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the potential identity resolution systems that may be used in IIoT. Firstly, an overview of the identity resolution system is introduced, including a reference framework that can be used to evaluate an identity resolution system. Then we review some influential identity resolution systems based on this reference framework. After that, we make a comparison from the perspective of whether they can meet IIoT requirements and technology selection.

A three-level hierarchy of local machines, factory clouds, and a research center is introduced with each level responsible for its dedicated tasks.

We analyse a sample of 174 manufacturing SMEs operating in Italy. Our results illustrate the distinguishing traits of the knowledge search paths required to implement Industry 4.0 technologies in an SME manufacturing setting. In particular, they indicate that the recognition of digital opportunities in both product design and manufacturing processes require a depth of collaboration in the innovation process to capture firm and industry-specific company needs and to create mutual trust among the parties. Conversely, digital opportunities in the realm of product/service platforms require a breadth of search for SMEs to invest in different information technology layers to support the digitalisation of a product. We also find that all three groups of digital opportunities positively influence the extent of adoption of information and digital technologies (e.g., IoT, big data analytics, simulation). Our findings bring finer-grained evidence on how digital opportunities are linked with the adoption of the different types of Industry 4.0 technologies, reflecting the peculiar traits of manufacturing SMEs.

This, however, demands new and innovative methods for engineering systems that support the required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to revolutionize traditional medical practices. A DT comprises a set of virtual representations of both the structural elements and dynamics of any physical asset (e.g., a patient) throughout its lifecycle. In the healthcare domain, it might represent a significan step forward towards tightening and improving the interactions between systems, caregivers and patients. Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.","","mhealth, software as a medical device, self-adaptive systems, healthcare, precision medicine, digital twin, personalized healthcare, models at run-time, autonomic computing, adaptive context monitoring","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Rivera2019.pdf",""

Maintenance is one of the functions that may benefit from the opportunities that emerge with the digital transformation of industrial processes. Nevertheless, until now very few research papers investigated on what digitalized manufacturing entails for maintenance organizations along both technical and social dimensions. The aim of this paper is to investigate the vision of the future of Maintenance within the industry 4.0 and to show empirical evidence on how manufacturing companies are approaching the digital transformation process of maintenance. An empirical investigation was developed through multiple case-study involving nine manufacturing companies in Italy. Findings emerge about the main perceived challenges by companies for the success of digital transformation of maintenance as well as the technological and organizational mechanisms that are used in ongoing innovative Maintenance projects.","","","",""

Design : We introduce the Industry 4.0 paradigm, presents its background, current state of development and its influence on the development of the simulation modelling paradigm. Further, we present the multiple case study methodology and examine several research and development projects involving automated industrial process modelling, presented in recent scientific publications and conclude with lessons learned. Results: We present the research problems and main results from five individual cases of adoption of the new simulation modelling paradigm. Main lesson learned is that while the new simulation modelling paradigm is being adopted by big companies and SMEs, there are significant differences depending on company size in problems that they face, and the methodologies and technologies they use to overcome the issues. Conclusion: While the examined cases indicate the acceptance of the new simulation modelling paradigm in the industrial and scientific communities, its adoption in academic environment requires close cooperation with industry partners and diversification of knowledge of researchers in order to build integrated, multi-level models of cyber-physical systems. As shown by the presented cases, lack of tools is not a problem, as the current generation of general purpose simulation modelling tools offers adequate integration options.","","","",""

Adaptivity concerns both the content being proposed, the sequence of learning items, and the way the conversation is conducted. The original approach allows the development of sustainable chatbots and empowers various non-technical actors (authors, teachers, publishers, and learners) to control the chatbot features directly. The aCHAT-WF framework (adaptive CHATbot for WorkFlows), proposed in this paper for managing conversational interfaces, conceptually represents all the aspects related to a conversation about business processes, with different facets for the user, the conversation flow, and the conversation contents, combining them to obtain a flexible interaction with the user. The paper focuses on the different preparation phases for instructional material based on Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models, separating the different roles involved in the construction of a chatbot for teaching business processes and with the possibility of defining different styles for the interaction with the users. The proposed method is configuration-driven, to facilitate the separation of the different aspects of the control of the interaction and the delivery of contents.","","","",""

Leveraging these hidden data instantaneously to reduce machine downtime could also minimize efforts in determining the causes of maintenance issues. This paper explores a novel method of bringing the factory floor data into an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment and visualizing real-time machine analytics through Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) based smart devices. The factory floor data from selective machines at a Volvo Group plant was integrated with IIoT and visualized in real-time through the use of AR-enabled devices such as an iPad and a HoloLens headset. The configuration process for the server and IIoT environment was automated through a software solution, and the performance and feasibility of spatial anchors were evaluated by testing accuracy, triggering times, and latency of data. The results displayed promising applications of AR/MR on factory floors for real-time machine data visualization and associated troubleshooting.","","IIoT, Augmented Reality, Factory Data, Industry 4.0, Mixed Reality, Smart Manufacturing","",""

Therefore, this paper develops a cloud computing taxonomy that is theoretically grounded by performing a structured literature review and empirically validated by conducting workshops with participants from industry and science. By describing the most important dimensions and characteristics of cloud computing in detail and by applying the taxonomy using three large cloud providers, we aim to give the reader a holistic overview of the cloud and demonstrate the relevance of cloud computing for digital innovation.","","","",""

The model estimates the grid impedance seen by a distributed energy resource. The proposed algorithm has characteristics of passive and active islanding detection methods. Using a discrete state-space representation of a dq0 axis power system as equality constraints, a digital twin is optimized to match the power system of interest. The concept is to use the estimated grid impedance as the parameter to identify the difference between normal operation and islanding scenarios. Selecting arbitrary initial values, the digital twin approximates the response of the actual system and therefore a value for the system impedance. Results indicate that the proposed method has the potential to estimate the grid impedance at the point of common coupling.","","Photovoltaic systems;Islanding;Sensitivity analysis;Digital twin;Simulation;Optimization methods;IEEE Standards;IEEE Std 1547;islanding detection;distributed generation;renewable energy;Lagrange;optimization","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\SaavedraPena2021.pdf",""

We sometimes even speak of an automated or intelligent home. However, connected objects allow the house to react automatically according to one or more events. This document presents a contribution to the realization of a wireless smart and also sustainable home. The house concerned by the construction is powered by a renewable, clean, and free energy source which is photovoltaic energy. Then, the house management system is based on an Arduino and embedded microprocessor-based systems. This work is a hybridization between several disciplines such as computer science, electronics, electricity, and mechanics. Next, a smart and sustainable home is characterized by many benefits like resident comfort, security, and energy-saving. The first part of this project focuses on building a model with the modules used (sensors, actuators, Wi-Fi interface, etc.). The second part is reserved for the implementation of the system and to make it controllable via a smartphone or a computer.","","","",""

We focus specifically on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to its salience and to the potential risks associated to failures in guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop a process model and validate three design propositions through a formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in the EU electrical power sector.

This paper discusses the importance of innovation for the mining industry and describes the mechanisms by which it is carried out. It includes a review of the drivers and actors involved and current trends. The digital transformation process that the industry is going through is analyzed, along with other relevant trends that are likely to shape the mining of the future.

However, certain deployments such as those employing Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN)-based technologies may present severe network restrictions in terms of throughput and supported packet length. This situation prompts the isolation of LPWAN systems on islands with limited interoperability with the Internet. For that reason, the IETF’s LPWAN working group has proposed a Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) scheme that permits compression and fragmentation of and IPv6/UDP/CoAP packets with the aim of making them suitable for transmission over the restricted links of LPWANs. Given the impact that such a solution can have in many IoT scenarios, this paper addresses its real evaluation in terms not only of latency and delivery ratio improvements, as a consequence of different compression and fragmentation levels, but also of the overhead in end node resources and useful payload sent per fragment. This has been carried out with the implementation of middleware and using a real testbed implementation of a LoRaWAN-to-IPv6 architecture together with a publish/subscribe broker for CoAP. The attained results show the advantages of SCHC, and sustain discussion regarding the impact of different SCHC and LoRaWAN configurations on the performance. It is highlighted that necessary end node resources are low as compared to the benefit of delivering long IPv6 packets over the LPWAN links. In turn, fragmentation can impose a lack of efficiency in terms of data and energy and, hence, a cross-layer solution is needed in order to obtain the best throughput of the network.","","","",""

Safety-critical systems, such as planes, are at risk because cyber-information cannot be provably tied to a specific physical part instance (e.g., impeller). This paper presents promising initial work showing that using piezoelectric sensors to measure impedance identities of parts may serve as a physically unclonable function that can produce unclonable part instance identities. When one of these impedance identities is combined with cyber-information and signed using existing public key infrastructure approaches, it creates a provable binding of cyber-information to a specific part instance. Our initial results from experimentation with traditionally and additively manufactured parts indicate that it will be extremely expensive and improbable for an attacker to counterfeit a part that replicates the impedance signature of a legitimate part.","","Cyber-physical system security, Manufacturing security, Counterfeit detection, Supply chain security, Real-time verification, Distributed supply chains","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Sandborn2021.pdf",""

Following the trends of the industrial IoT including Smart Manufacturing, Connected Factories, and Factories of the Future, industrial and academic projects have also been aiming at developing better solutions for IIoT-related projects. Such solutions typically heavily rely on interoperability requirements between sensors, actuators and other IoT-based diverse smart devices toward, for example, supply chain and production management services such as ERP, MES, and SCADA. This chapter identifies challenges in developing IIoT solutions, based on recent R&D projects. Such identification, in turn, contributes to proposing opportunities, challenges, methodologies, and approaches for the analysis, design, implementation, and deployment of R&D projects. This is specifically so when developing interoperable solutions for the IIoT domain, mainly concerning the applications of the IoT and services to the manufacturing industry.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Santos2019.pdf",""

But there is a failure to understand about how these technologies are implemented in businesses today. As a result, we want to learn more about the patterns of adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in manufacturing and production companies. In this paper, we explore if production organisations can be organised based on Industry 4.0 adoption trends and how these patterns allow the definition of certain industrial 4.0 technology configurations. Such study helps us to understand what is necessary for the proper adoption in manufacturing and production enterprises of such technologies.

The importance of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) have been increased dramatically with the rise of industrialization and industry 4.0. As new opportunities bring their own challenges, with the massive interconnected devices of the IIoT, cyber security of those networks and privacy of their users have become an important aspect. Specifically, intrusion detection for industrial networks (IIoT) has great importance. For instance, it is a key factor in improving the safe operation of the smart grid systems yet protecting the privacy of the consumers at the same time. In the same manner, data streaming is a valid option when the analysis is to be pushed from the cloud to the fog for industrial networks to provide agile response, since it brings the advantage of fast action on intrusion detection and also can buy time for intrusion mitigation.  In order to dive deep in industrial networks, basic ground needs to be settled. Hence, this chapter serves in this manner, by presenting basic and emerging technologies along with ideas and discussions: First, an introduction of semiconductor evolution is provided along with the up-to-date hi-tech wired/wireless communication solutions for industrial networks. This is followed by a thorough representation of future trends in industrial environments. More importantly, enabling technologies for industrial networks is also presented. Finally, the chapter is concluded with a summary of the presentations along with future projections of IIoT networks.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Sari2020.pdf",""

The risks posed by the integration of Information Technology solutions with Operational Technology systems have been a key topic also at the latest World Economic Forum conference, where cyber-attacks of critical infrastructures were discussed in the context of the most significant risks for the upcoming decade. The findings of this paper are applicable to other industries. The paper aims to highlight that by initially understanding the vulnerabilities of the IT components and by taking the right cybersecurity preventive measures, critical infrastructure can be protected against these kinds of threats.

Many authors focused on reliability-based approaches to optimize O&amp;M, but little attention has been given to study the influence of macroeconomic variables on the long-term maintenance policy. This work aims to optimize time-based maintenance (TBM) policy in the mining industry. The mine environment is reproduced employing a virtual model that resembles a digital twin (DT) of the system. The effect of maintenance decisions is replicated by a discrete event simulation (DES), whereas a model of the financial operability of the mine is realized through System Dynamics (SD). The simultaneous use of DES and the SD allows us to reproduce the environment with high-fidelity and to minimize the cost of O&amp;M. The selected illustrative case example demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible. The issues of using high dimensional simulation data from DT-models in managerial decision making is identified and discussed.","","","",""

Foundries 4.0 refer to the inclusion of Industry 4.0 principles in traditional foundries. The casting process is known to be one of the most energy-intensive processes. Enabling sensor-based technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) for condition monitoring, can be an efficient means to bring down the energy costs. IoTs can also be implemented for real-time waste-monitoring. Embedded sensors can be utilized in determining excessive loads during the casting operation. This is very useful to identify overloading and in avoiding potential damage to the castings. Introduction of Additive Manufacturing can reduce cycle time and material consumption. This paper aims to introduce the concept of Foundries 4.0. The key focus is to highlight the integration of digital technologies in establishing foundries of the future. Challenges involved in the establishment of smart foundries are also discussed. A case-study discussing establishment of energy-efficient smart foundries is also presented in this work.","","","",""

You cannot be smart in the business and social worlds, if you are not mastering digital phones and watches, home pods, and pads and connecting your car and bracelet via intelligent apps or your glasses even. We are all living more and more digital lives to augment our physical senses, leverage our resources, and stretch our productivity—we end up almost believing how digital could make us immortal and able to reproduce our thinking and ways of communicating to our dears even after our physical body will be gone. Indeed, digital immortality is pitched as a commercial proposition by many a Silicon Valley’s start-up (Adam Gabbatt 2020) Eternime one among many others (Dave Schilling 2016).

They all share a common theme, reminding us of how weak we are and of humankind’s fallibility (and even existential risk) through history. We discussed at length COVID-19, which came up as a totally unexpected event during the writing of this book. In fact, climate change looks like bringing even greater disruption in the world of cities to come—with the pandemic giving us just a preliminary idea of how hard it will be to deal with this. As stated by The Economist, as economy activity has stalled because of lockdown, 2020 will likely see drops in CO2 emissions of between 4 and 7%. But in order to keep the earth warming target of less than 2 °C, CO2 would need to fall to near zero by 2050—without halting the economies and locking down entire populations but rewiring the first and reshaping the second (The great disrupter 2020). The rewiring of the economy will require a radical redesign of the energy sector and of its global geopolitics, with powerful petro-States of the past giving room to even more powerful electro-States of the future. With clean energy gaining momentum with both investors and end users (and voters) and with interest rates near zero, more and more international politicians are now backing accelerated green-infrastructure conversion plans. The shift from fossil fuel (today accounting for 85% of the energy produced globally) will be evident everywhere and ever so much in the world’s mega cities, which will have to rely on renewable and green energy to provide mobility, heat and air conditioning, and the basic support to commercial and manufacturing sectors working in their extended urban and suburban areas. Energy will also be needed to support services to the person, such as healthcare.","","","",""

It would be hard to put a precise date on when it all started (creative destruction is, after all, a continuous process and the very engine of growth for the capitalistic model). It would be even more difficult to put clear references and well-defined assumptions on the main change agents and drivers of these—digital innovation (a “misnomer per se) being likely one of the most often cited factors of transformation (transformation being also a “misnomer). However, it is safe to postulate that the pace of change has been consistently accelerating, with deeper and wider disruptions happening more often and in unexpected ways. The very notion of “tail risk is now under scrutiny—with so many “black swans flying around, it is difficult to see the linearity element in all this, not to mention the normality of a distribution that is based on large numbers and predictable casualty. In this context of extreme and accelerated, multi-faceted disruptions, “smart cities have been ailed and positioned as a good force for change. Hosting more than half of the global population and set to rise further, they have been promising “smarter ways of doing things—basically, leveraging digital technology to offer better use cases on such utilities such as energy consumption, mobility, and safety. The initial hype linked to large development and urban regeneration programs designed around these use cases has so far fallen short of expectations—with real estate values and the very attractiveness of the city in question failing to capture the value arising from the “smart city component of these. In answer to this, a number of new technological advances are already being set in place—from 5G (mobile connectivity, with real-time and enhanced, localized hedge computing) to IoT (always charged, smaller, and even implantable) to multi-cloud-based solutions where AI/ML apps are becoming a core part of the software as a service proposition. As a result, the “smart city is becoming “cyber, with greater centrality put on the individual and on the specific services he may need, for business or leisure.

Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.","","energy research, industry 4.0, smart energy, sustainability, system integration","",""

Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms. We propose an IoT Cybersecurity Communication Scorecard to help organizations benchmark the density and sentiment of their corporate communications regarding security against their specific industry.","","","",""

The core concept for I4.0 is the digital twin or asset administration shell (AAS), as it is called by the German Plattform Industrie 4.0 initiative. It shall provide a machine-readable description of I4.0 components, being available over the entire lifecycle and being used for various advanced use cases and services. Security has been an increasingly known and needed aspect during the last years and is a key requirement to make I4.0 actually happen. In a previous paper we proposed concepts for integrating authorization tightly into OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)-based information models. OPC UA is a new and promising industrial technology, which could be used to implement AAS concepts. The current proposals for AAS define necessary security concepts; however, there is no work explaining how these concepts can be implemented in OPC UA. This paper closes this gap by elaborating on realization alternatives in OPC UA. Furthermore, we extend our basic performance evaluation with more realistic data access patterns based on I4.0 use cases, showing the applicability of our approach in practice.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Schmitt2019.pdf",""

In order to maintain line stability, qualified maintenance personnel are essential for fast and secure troubleshooting the highly automated transportation system of a semiconductor plant. However, the transfer of knowledge to new maintenance personnel for coping with malfunctions is a big challenge. This is also a contribution in the digital transformation in this context for training of people at highly digitized workplaces by introducing a virtual training for (new) employees. This training supports new maintenance personnel to gain practical experience in operating a modern human-machine interface without disturbing the existing productive system. Initial results indicate that this approach supports the transformation process in a targeted manner. For future work, we aim to examine other performance metrics and their impact over time.","","Training;Measurement;Digital twin;Digital transformation;Employment;Transportation;Maintenance engineering;transportation system;virtual training;digitalization;digital twin;cyber range","",""

Drivers of digitization include digital technology breakthroughs; changes in people’s behavior, attitudes and expectations; comparatively low barriers to entry; and the availability of huge amounts of venture capital. Objects of digitization are processes and work; products and services; and business models. The impacts of digitization include large and varied impacts on the economy as a whole, extraordinary opportunities, and significant challenges for businesses. Given digitization’s characteristics and impacts, digitalization is no longer a choice but an imperative; for all businesses across all industries an regions the motto is digitalize or drown. The digital innovation and transformation framework introduced in this chapter—which is comprised of the eight dimensions of customer centricity; leadership and strategy; business models, including offerings (products and services); processes; structure and governance; people and skills; culture; and technology foundation—can serve as an orientation to digitalization.","","","",""

The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Schroeder2021.pdf",""

In such a network based CS, graphs of possible machine command sequences are specified in advance by physics frameworks. The actual traffic pattern, however, is determined at runtime, depending on interlocks and beam requests from experiments and accelerators. In 'unlucky' combinations, large packet bursts can delay commands beyond their deadline, potentially causing emergency shutdowns. Thus, prior verification if any possible combination of given command sequences can be delivered on time is vital to guarantee deterministic behavior of the CS. Deterministic network calculus (DNC) can derive upper bounds on message delivery latencies. This paper presents an approach for calculating worst-case descriptors of runtime traffic patterns. These so-called arrival curves are deduced from specified partial traffic sequences and are used to calculate end-to-end traffic properties. With the arrival curves and a DNC model of the FAIR CS network, a worst-case latency for specific packet flows or the whole CS can be obtained.","","","",""

This paper looks at the two levels of disruptive technologies. A first order disruption is a localized change, within a market or industry. A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.","","Disruptive technologies, Innovation ecosystem, Resilient systems, Technological trends","",""

This paper considers the future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory, tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to provide the background to a soil and landscape `digital twin' and the consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools. Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of public-private partnerships in this development and application. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.","","","",""

In such domain, the search for “agility has come to be one of the most requested features. As a result, considerable research has been conducted to design manufacturing systems which embody manufacturing flexibility. It is in this context where the evolution of the supply-chain based concept of Mini Factories is relevant, as it allows a network-like interconnectivity between assets by setting up factories inside the premises of the principal manufacturer. It is stated that at the core of Industry 4.0 implementation, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the bridge between the physical world and the IoT world or, in other words, the data model from where the digital twin stems from. In this paper we present a methodology to create Asset Administrative Shells in a Mini Factories context. We argue that our approach, effectively embodies concepts related to Industry 4.0 in a modular way, allowing the much-desired agility. By using our proposed methodology, Model Factory @ARTC has been able to create a seamless integration of assets into our factory of the future, demonstrating the connectivity and some of the enhanced capabilities of Industry 4.0.","","Automated Design, Configuration of Sensory Systems, Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Representation, Management, Model Factory, Industry 4.0","",""

Others speak of a fourth industrial revolution and mean a new stage of technological progress. Others still think that it is nonsense to speak of revolution, and that industry is simply continuing to develop in an evolutionary manner. A brief look at the history of industrial revolution thus seems fitting.  Germany as an industrial location is playing a central role in the Industrie 4.0 initiative (Initiative Industrie 4.0). Will a research initiative grow into something very practical for Germany? And just what does Industrie 4.0 have to do with the major issue of digitalization, which is now monopolizing all media? Just because the name “Industrie 4.0 unfortunately smacks of it, does not mean that the initiative necessarily only benefits industry. Yet those of us who wish to investigate the topic naturally want to know who will actually profit. This introductory chapter seeks to illuminate these questions.","","","",""

Industry 4.0 and digital transformation may increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. A digital twin (DT) is a key enabler in implementing Industry 4.0 in the areas of construction and smart cities. It is an emerging technology that connects different objects by utilising the advanced Internet of Things (IoT). As a technology, it is in high demand in various industries, and its literature is growing exponentially. Previous digital modeling practices, the use of data acquisition tools, human–computer–machine interfaces, programmable cities, and infrastructure, as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM), have provided digital data for construction, monitoring, or controlling physical objects. However, a DT is supposed to offer much more than digital representation. Characteristics such as bi-directional data exchange and real-time self-management (e.g., self-awareness or self-optimisation) distinguish a DT from other information modeling systems. The need to develop and implement DT is rising because it could be a core technology in many industrial sectors post-COVID-19. This paper aims to clarify the DT concept and differentiate it from other advanced 3D modeling technologies, digital shadows, and information systems. It also intends to review the state of play in DT development and offer research directions for future investigation. It recommends the development of DT applications that offer rapid and accurate data analysis platforms for real-time decisions, self-operation, and remote supervision requirements post-COVID-19. The discussion in this paper mainly focuses on the Smart City, Engineering and Construction (SCEC) sectors.","","","",""

In order to create a well synchronized digital-twin simulator in manufacturing, information and activities of a physical machine need to be virtualized. Many existing digital-twins stream read-only data of machine sensors and do not incorporate operations of manufacturing machines through Internet. In this paper, a new method of virtualization is proposed to integrate machining data and operations into the digital-twins using Internet scale machine tool communication method. A fully functional digital-twin is implemented in CPMC testbed using MTComm and several manufacturing application scenarios are developed to evaluate the proposed method and system. Performance analysis shows that it is capable of providing data-driven visual monitoring of a manufacturing process and performing manufacturing operations through digital twins over the Internet. Results of the experiments also shows that the MTComm based digital twins have an excellent efficiency.","","Manufacturing;Three-dimensional displays;Cloud computing;Solid modeling;Virtualization;Visualization;Machine tools;Digital-Twin;Virtualization;MTComm;CPMC;Cyber-Physical Systems;Cyber Manufacturing","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Shahriar2018.pdf",""

However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle.

In respect to its practical world applications, the IoT has the prospect of entirely transforming the pharma industry by facilitating and mechanizing the isolated nursing of patients, the innovation of different types of drugs, their admittance, and much more. The combination of the IoT with the growing digitization of figures in the pharma segment has led to a new direction and opened the floodgates for enormous changes and industrial scale innovations. While striving for ingenious inventions, the software needs to keep pace. As previously observed, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are providing tremendous opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry. Similarly, the IoT offers pharma production with an assortment of innovative prospects, such as an improved mechanism for drug trade and better analytical tools. Now the question is how can the IoT be used to benefit the pharmaceutical industry? The answer is that IoT sensors and detectors can help in enabling the optimal circumstances for supervising different styles of biomaterials and chemicals, detecting tool flaws, and it can be also used to assist in the prevention of fraudulent drug activities. People who are involved in industries like pharmaceuticals work in a risk-prone industry where they must avoid asset failures at any cost, as making mistakes is unacceptable because quality control has a direct impact on the health of the consumer and there should be no opportunities for errors to be made. There are a variety of problems that may arise in plants during the manufacture of drugs, such as wear and tear of equipment with time, corrosion, excessive voltage, and destruction caused by the chemicals used. Keeping a proper track of all these risks is crucial to meet the desired quality of the drug, hence a number of sensors are used for the assimilation of enormous amounts of data from different departments that help in managing, controlling, and supervising everything that takes place, initiating a sequence response for better efficacy and control, which will eventually reduce the production cost, minimize waste, and allow for better control.","","Internet of Things (IoT), pharmaceuticals, sensors, quality control, supply chain management, pharma logistics, health care and medicine","",""

It has major advancements in its applications and research as well. ML is the study in which a machine is trained with past data and examples and uses algorithms to build the logic. Important ML applicationsare speech recognition, computer vision, bio-surveillance, robot or automation control, empirical science experiments, DNA classification, intrusion detection, astronomical data analysis, information security, transportation, etc. According to a recent survey, computer-generated insurance advice is helpful to customers. Using ML, determination of cover for a certain customer can be predicted. Choice of the mode of transportation can also be benefited from ML. ML predicts the mode of transportation for an individual to make their travel better. Travel modes may include private car, public transport (bus or train), or soft mode (walking or cycling). The very first step in applying ML is to define a problem. This step includes three important processes to be considered, namely, problem identification, the motivation behind problem solving, and the solution itself. This chapter presents the evolution of ML along with the purpose it serves. It also focuses on the ideas of concept learning along with the methods and algorithms therein.","","Big data, machine learning, healthcare, ecosystem conservation","",""

Scarcity of essentials increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world implementation.

Academic and press articles followed by interviews from industry experts were used to explore the nature of blockchain technology (BCT) for the hospitality and tourism sector (HTS). A hybrid research methodology is proposed to investigate the criticality of factors, their hierarchical model, and cause & effect relationships. 35 Employees from two geographies, namely India (N=17) and Netherlands (N=18) in hospitality and tourism firms, were interviewed. In the next step, the expert opinions were collected using the Analytic hierarchy process - Interpretive Structural Modeling- Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ISM-DEMATEL) technique. A forward-looking approach was adopted by considering the implications of barriers and drivers on the adoption of BCT and thereby benefiting HTS. The results suggest that ‘low cost’ and ‘risk management’ are the key drivers with driving power of 1 and 10 in Indian and the Netherlands, respectively. They are placed at I and VI hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group. ‘Lack of Government Regulation/ Policy’ and ‘Market Uncertainty’ are the critical barriers with driving power 9 and 10 in the Indian and Netherlands context, respectively.

Development of complex SCPS required the creation of new approaches, models, methods and technologies. But certain problems began to arise, starting from tasks such as research, modeling and using of the model. It is possible to obtain fundamentally new knowledge as a result of the fact that a human is presented in SCPS. This knowledge was not previously entered into the SCPS knowledge base or known to its resources [16]. Also there are problems associated with communication in socio-cyber-physical systems. For example, one of the problem is in the interaction between devices at the software level [1]. To eliminate the shortcomings, multimodal interfaces are being actively developed, which are aimed at creating a way of interaction between a computer and a person, similar to the interaction between humans. In this way we use all known modalities that are accepted for human communication. In addition, this development will help to solve the main problem of SCPS which means to increase reliability by duplicating information through several channels. There is also a problem in the development of technical requirements for socio-cyber-physical systems. The difficulty in developing such requirements is that they can change throughout the life cycle of the system due to the constant development of socio-cyber-physical systems.","","","",""

Recently, players of the real estate and building sector have turned strategic attention and research investments to the automation of building operations, aware of the business relevance of the occupancy phase of facilities. This investigation analyzed R&D programs and experimental projects in Japan to foresee the role of BIM in the automation of building operations. A survey of disclosed information helped to understand the trends in automation research with the adoption of digital technologies for immediate and future use. Appliances from electronics manufacturers have been incorporated into complex cyber-physical systems to communicate with the built facility through a BIM-IoT framework. The evolution of ICT has influenced building management systems attributes which require new definitions of the set of data to be delivered and maintained by project players. There is recent evidence of efforts to turn BIM as the platform that creates, manages and also stores information for future BIM-FM uses, even though the integration with BAS/BEMS is not fully solved. Finally, this study identified connections between prior construction automation achievements by Japanese contractors and future orientation related to the technological challenge of context-awareness and servitization.","","","",""

Digital twins are intended to reflect the structure and processes of object functioning. In addition, we plan to delegate them the decision-making in managing these objects in real-time. Such a digital twin has to become smarter over time. This virtual entity has to gain knowledge and skills to select optimal scenarios for controlling object and improving its functioning parameters. Therefore, the initial problem in its development is creating a monitoring system for the collection, unification, aggregation, storage, and transmission of subject-oriented data. Such data include information about the object operation and environmental state. The data must be promptly obtained from peripheral equipment (controlling and measuring devices). For the effective operation of a digital twin, we have to partially transfer functions of primary data processing, their intellectual analysis and decision-making to the controlling and measuring devices. To this end, we use agents that implement software on peripheral equipment.","","","",""

A proposed solution for improving performance in the manufacturing sector, and consequently developing several economies, such as Brazil, is the adoption of the digital strategy known as Industry 4.0. Since 2011, when this strategy was presented during Hannover Messe, in Germany, it is being considered as fourth industrial revolution, as a result of the developing new digital technologies and principles of implementation. However, to deployment of Industry 4.0, the manufacturing will face a number of challenges, such as related to technical, strategical and organizational contexts. The most frequent challenges are sorted by technical issues and demand for systems in CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) technology. To benefit the manufacturing sector, the challenge of adoption CPS technologies, on real cases should be analyzed. The aim of this article is to present an international literature review about the challenges of Industry 4.0 on manufacturing sector. The literature does not present yet a broad study for identifying the challenges in this sector. As result, was discovered that there is a gap in the literature in the identification of systems solutions, simulated and or applied in the real context, which meet the requirements of CPSs, due to the low level of maturity of this technology. Developing algorithms of CPS and the related technologies of Industry 4.0, beside meet the new production demand is the fundamental challenge in the search for a digital and efficient industry.","","","",""

This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0.

However, this openness and high decentralization of BIM and IoT services of smart buildings leads to several security issues that the use of Blockchain has been proved to provide an effective layer of data protection. This paper examines the interconnection and interoperability of BIM, IoT, Blockchain and advanced digital technologies in the demanding environment of a museum, where efficient and secure monitoring and management are critical factors that should be satisfied. It focuses on the application of the aforementioned technologies in the context of a building that has to deal with multiple administrative requirements, the management and protection of the exhibition areas and the objects exposed in them, the security and the convenience of the visitors, the financial management of the tickets and the profits from museum shops, the workshops, the laboratories and the storage areas, which usually contain numerous invaluable artifacts.","","Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modeling (BIM), Smart Buildings","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Siountri2019.pdf",""

This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics.

Incorporating artificial intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology's benefits. This technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.","","","",""

Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies.","","","",""

Such teams require a dynamic decision framework to allow ICS operators to maintain services during the recovery of full operating capability. There is empirical evidence that static incident response playbooks do not provide enough flexibility in their definition to support situations outside of the scope of their initial definition, and that they have been ignored when cyber incidents have occurred. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with ICS incident response professional identified three main areas of concern: communication, information sharing between knowledge areas, and achieving external buy-in. The Agile Incident Response for Industrial Control Systems (AIR4ICS) framework has been developed to integrate Agile techniques into the Cyber Security domain of incident response. AIR4ICS provides a dynamic approach to improve situational awareness, information sharing, collective decision-making and response flexibility within the unique context of ICS. The techniques used in AIR4ICS were initially shaped by interviews with professionals with experience of protecting ICS, structured using the Scrum methodology, and refined through a series of Cyber Incident Response exercises with Incident Response professionals facing-off against specialist ICS Red Teams. AIR4ICS has resulted in a framework that provides a modular approach that can be adapted to fit the working practices, skillsets and priorities of individual organisations. The framework improves communication, promotes information sharing between knowledge areas, and increases external buy-in. Ultimately, AIR4ICS provides a dynamic decision framework that allows Incident Response Teams to manage uncertainty and unpredictability to reduce the time taken to restore normal operations.","","Incident response, Agile, Industrial control systems, SCADA: Threat hunting","",""

With the development of computing power, innovative algorithms, and gathering of massive data, AI will be rejuvenated in the next decade and become one of the most important enabling technologies for 5G automation. How to use the powerful analysis, judgment, and prediction capabilities provided by the AI algorithms to enable 5G equipment, networks and service systems, and combine them with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of carriers' networks become an important topic in the ICT industry. Based on deep understanding, accumulated experience in telecom field, and long-term investment in AI strategies, many organizations have been introducing AI technology to telecom networks and contributing to development of standards essential for improving the quality and security of AI products and services, ensuring user safety and creating a fair and open industry ecosystem. 5G networks can be automatically deployed (automatic service deployment and automatic running) with the introduction of AI based on application scenarios. AI algorithms can also be used for self-healing (automatic fault recovery), self-optimization (network self-optimization) and creating autonomous 5G systems (self-evolving networks), which continuously improve network efficiency and reduce OPEX. This article aims at presenting the most relevant use cases, prominent research outcomes, latest standard developments and related standardization gaps, examples of AI strategy interpretation, AI solutions – including communication intelligent platform, AI model service, and deployment solution – and typical application scenarios. As a part of this framework, this article introduces the most important aspects of AI security, in terms of protecting the integrity and confidentiality of AI models and data, and thus preventing attackers from changing the inference results or stealing data.","","Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, autonomous networks, automation, autonomics, 5G","",""

In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.","","Three - dimensional ground resistance modeling, Ground resistance, Ground liquefaction, GIS, Digital twin","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Song2018.pdf",""

Answering the demands of critical IoT (Internet of Things), and mass IoT application users - beside lifting mobile broadband to the next level - remains the challenge for 5G. While generic, high level targets for KPIs are widely communicated, it is not yet well-understood how the various demands can affect the traffic mixture. Both the radio- and the core-domains of the cellular network have to cope with traffic peaks, and have to obey various QoS (Quality of Service) guarantees. In order to do this, traffic-related characteristics should be determined, and this knowledge should be used during network planning, optimization and service shaping.This paper aims to provide insights to user behavioral patterns for these three key application areas: mobile broadband, critical IoT and mass IoT. Since traffic volume- and burst-related user behaviour is not expected to change suddenly, current, targeted data collection on 4G links would provide a good basic insight for future, 5G usage - at least as traffic patterns.

This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.","","Security;Digital twin;Monitoring;Integrated circuits;Process control;SCADA systems;Analytical models;Digital Twins;SCADA;pipelines;security;programmable logic controllers;DTaaS","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Sousa2021.pdf",""

More in detail, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Circular Economy (CE) are two key concepts that are characterizing the present and that will shape the future. From the extant literature review emerges that, although academics identify a possible synergy between these topics, a concrete integrated framework able to achieve CE at systemic level is still missing. The objective of this research is to put in relation the I4.0 and CE paradigms to understand the link between the two topics and envisage a new framework focused on circularity among supply chains. Therefore, a systematic literature review on CE, I4.0 and on their mutual relationship have been conducted to investigate which are the synergies and how the new I4.0 technologies support the implementation of CE at supply chains network level. Hence, a framework in which I4.0 technologies support the adoption of Reduce, Redesign, Recycling and Remanufacturing strategies has been developed. Indeed, starting from the 6Rs’ model (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, Redesign, Remanufacture), the focus has been shifted towards these 4Rs since they have been considered the most affected by I4.0. Regarding the use of I4.0 technologies, Cloud Manufacturing (MaaS) and Additive Manufacturing have been deemed the most enabling technologies. Indeed, they allow to respectively aggregate resources and reduce wastes. The framework is supported by a quantitative analysis of economic and environmental impacts that results in the definition of a Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (MOILP). The framework works in closing the loop by acting as strategic node able to link different supply chains. It has been developed focusing on discrete manufacturing and replicable in different sectors. Finally, the model identified has been supported by some pilot assessments through semi-structured interviews.","","Circular Economy, Industry 4.0, Closed-Loop, Sustainable Manufacturing, MOILP, Supply Chain","",""

The digital transformation is an opportunity to shed some light on the role of the human individual in digital manufacturing and the business development potential of a human-centered work design. Measures taken to adapt work to people refer to technical-ergonomic conditions and/or to substantive-organizational conditions of the work activity. Immersion, that is, complete immersion in the virtual world by means of head-mounted displays or projections, addresses as many human senses as possible, in order to achieve a realistic simulation.

The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.","","Digitalisation, Industry 4.0, Purchasing, Supply management, Design science","",""

Practice-orientation refers to efforts that have resulted in positive impact and transformations in the delivery of healthcare. The review is epochal in the sense that there have been 3 major stages of innovation and diffusion in digital health that are identified. The year 1998 was deemed a significant starting point for the literature search because it marked the introduction of the term e-health. The main objective of this review is to track the evolution of digital health and the conspicuous developments in the field - crucial steps to get a grasp of the key issues involving the delivery of healthcare. The article includes a general discussion of these various key issues and sensitizing concepts. The sense-making thus shed some light on the areas of enquiry, which are central to identifying the direction in which the practice of healthcare is headed. These areas of enquiry often referred to as ‘substantive areas’ in qualitative research terminology, were identified as ‘electronic medical records’, ‘health cloud’, ‘data analytics’, ‘Internet-enabled devices’, and other ‘emerging information technologies’. The article concludes with a synthesis of key inferences drawn from the epochal review.

This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene.

Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.","","Semantic Enrichment, Multiview Classification, Viewpoint Entropy, Indoor Point Clouds","",""

The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components - information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers – which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes – and aims to predict - information flows across an asset's lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.","","","",""

Noticing that DTs may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of industrial IoT, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed.

In this paper, dynamic digital twin (DT) of aerial-assisted IoV is established to capture the time-varying resource supply and demands, so that unified resource scheduling and allocation can be performed. We design a two-stage incentive mechanism for resource allocation based on Stackelberg game where DT of vehicles or road side units (RSUs) is deemed as the leader, and the RSUs who provide computing services are as the follower. In the first stage incentive, we determine the computing resources that RSUs are willing to offer according to vehicles’ preferences. To further maximize the satisfaction of vehicles and the overall energy efficiency, a distributed incentive mechanism based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then designed, in which the resource allocation policy for each vehicle is optimized. Thanks to ADMM, the incentive mechanism can be run at multiple RSUs in parallel to reduce delay and relieve the computational burden of UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the satisfaction of vehicles and the energy efficiency at the same time.","","Resource management;Vehicle dynamics;Task analysis;Dynamic scheduling;Games;Real-time systems;Optimization;digital twin;Internet of Vehicles;incentives;ADMM;Stackelberg game.","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Sun2021a.pdf",""

However, several challenges arise with this technological transformation, i.e., trade-offs among different sustainability indicators, unclear benefits, lifecycle environmental impact, inequity issues, and technology maturity. Thus, to better tackle the current research gaps, future suggestions are given to focus on the balance among different sustainability indicators through the entire lifecycle, human-centric technological transformation, system integration and digital twin, semi-autonomous transportation solutions, smart reverse logistics, and so forth.","","","",""

This research investigates the need of blockchain in Industry 4.0 environment from Big Data perspective in supply chain management. The research method used in this study involves a combination of an Action Research method and Case Study research. More specifically, the action research method was applied in two industry case studies that implemented and tested the designed architecture in a global logistics environment. Case Study A examined the blockchain application in cross-border cargo movements whereas Case Study B investigated the application in a liquid chemical logistics company serving to petroleum industries. Our research analysis has identified that the Case A subject had disconnected systems and services for blockchain wherein the big data interactions had failed (failure case). Whereas in Case B, the company has achieved nearly 25% increase in revenue through its customer service after the blockchain implementation and thereby reduction in paperwork and carbon emissions (success case). This research contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge to big data and blockchain by identifying key implementation guideline and issues for blockchain in supply chain management. Further, action-based research coupled with a case study approach has been used to evaluate the application aspects of the architecture's scalability and functionality of bigdata and blockchain in supply chain management.","","Big data architecture, Action research, Case study research, Blockchain adoption, Supply chain management","",""

Sustainable supply chain visibility is premised on sharing of mutually benefiting information, to achieve associated sustainability objectives including those related to economic, environmental and social goals. Sustainable supply chains strive for distinctive visibility with its attendant benefits that include improving and strengthening the supply chain for competitive advantage. Advances in technology such as blockchain technology can help facilitate effective management of sustainable supply chain visibility and in delivering associated benefits. The relational characteristics of blockchain and sustainable supply chain visibility has recently been reported in the literature with some emphasis on the capacity, capability and context of sustainable supply chain visibility. This paper explores a notion of context-awareness and blockchain in relation to sustainable supply chain visibility. A landscape for an architecture of a blockchain-based sustainable supply chain visibility management platform centred on context-awareness is suggested. The main thrust of the considerations is provisioning of secure, auditable and mutually benefiting sustainable supply chain information sharing, for distinctive visibility, in heterogeneous context-aware scenarios whilst recognising the underlying characteristics of sustainable supply chain visibility.","","Supply chain, visibility, sustainability, blockchain, context awareness","",""

This innovation sets up a way to deal with industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name suggests, “Digital Twin infers that a reproduction of the product is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data, processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the successful working of the products geographically distributed. The impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital twin. The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use. Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the virtual machine without the need of a specific training. With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting, organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud. It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and process it effectively.","","Cloud security, Digital twin prototype, Digital twin instance, Prognostics, Skyhigh security, Virtualization, Internet of things","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Susila2020a.pdf",""

Besides, the SCADA system is now open to any external heterogeneous networks to facilitate monitoring of industrial equipment, but this causes a new vulnerability in the SCADA network system. Any disruption on the SCADA system will give rise to a dangerous impact on industrial devices. Therefore, deep research and development of reliable intrusion detection system (IDS) for SCADA system/network is required. Via a thorough literature review, this paper firstly discusses current security issues of SCADA system and look closely benchmark dataset and SCADA security holes, followed by SCADA traffic anomaly recognition using artificial intelligence techniques and visual traffic monitoring system. Then, touches on the encryption technique suitable for the SCADA network. In the end, this paper gives the trend of SCADA IDS in the future and provides a proposed model to generate a reliable IDS, this model is proposed based on the investigation of previous researches.

The next big challenge will be the transformation to (digitized) multicountry networked ecosystems. First, the last chapter gives an overview of the remaining key issues in maritime supply chains, hampering the transition from a linear maritime supply chain thinking toward a network industry. It furthermore provides solutions for handling those problems. Second, following Finger and Jaag 2015, the reshaping of the maritime supply chain is discussed from the industry, policy, and management perspectives. Last, some scenarios of how the industry should evolve from partner collaboration (one-to-one collaboration) to a maritime supply network (many-to-many collaboration) are discussed. From a business perspective, this trend of (maritime) actors banding together platform-enabled ecosystems can leverage their strengths and competitiveness.","","Maritime supply chain, Maritime supply network, Ecosystem, ICT innovation, Regulatory, Physical and digital flow","",""

In this study, we develop a program that utilizes a data processing platform to read, transform, and integrate data to create mediated data with a common data structure. This mediated data can be used to construct analytical models for various numerical analyses. Using the program developed, a grid model of 3-D ground surface as the mediated data was constructed based on borehole data obtained through a ground survey. Each grid point has basic material parameters of soil, and these parameters are estimated from borehole data and other investigation reports. Each grid point has general geotechnical parameters and can be easily converted to a 3-D finite-element model. When the borehole data is added or changed, the analytical model can be updated with almost no cost, whereas it would be very costly to create the model manually.","","Numerical models;Data models;Analytical models;Soil;Geology;Solid modeling;XML;Borehole data;data processing platform (DPP);grid ground model;numerical simulation","",""

Digital twin (DT) and blockchain (BC) technologies have been widely studied in many fields, as they can provide a trustful method for the process of cyber-physical integration. In view of the insufficient interaction of physical and cyber spaces and distrust challenges encountered in the development of the current Industrial Internet platform based manufacturing service collaboration, this paper proposes a DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service collaboration mechanism towards the Industrial Internet platform. In addition, based on the analysis of manufacturing collaboration development, the DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service management, challenges, and future work of implementing DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service management for the Industrial Internet Platform are discussed.","","Manufacturing service collaboration, Manufacturing service management, Industrial Internet platform, Digital twin, Blockchain","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Tao2020.pdf",""

Blockchain is a promising technology to solve such risks by providing decentralized and immutable data storage. However, integrating blockchain with BIM faces a problem that blockchain is inherently unsuitable for storing large-sized design files like BIM models, hindering blockchain from protecting BIM data integrity. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example. Results show that: (1) DCDE is a feasible solution for secure design collaboration, and (2) DCDE latency (in millisecond-level), TPS (60 transactions per second), and storage cost (12.5 KB per day) are within an acceptable range.","","Blockchain, Collaborative BIM, Common data environment (CDE), Hyperledger fabric, Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Smart contract","",""

The historical pyramidal model is being progressively replaced by an ecosystem of multiple stakeholders, with the result that the balancing of energy supply and demand can no longer be managed by a centralized system: smart grids are rapidly becoming a prerequisite for renewable energy to become dominant. However, the current energy regulation is forcing players in the value chain to operate in isolation, while smart grids require data sharing between the stakeholders.

However, remanufacturing systems are faced with many challenges that are not typically found in traditional manufacturing systems. Inspired by the need to better understand their idiosyncrasies, particular needs and implications, this paper aims to scrutinise current issues and concerns about digital transformation in the remanufacturing systems. In particular, the paper reviews the extant literature to observe: (1) how the I4.0 technologies have so far been used in remanufacturing and (2) the benefits and risks that need to be considered by remanufacturers when adopting the I4.0 technologies. We have elucidated the significance of our findings and subsequently synthesised our thoughts into eight propositions that demystify the mechanisms of how the I4.0 technologies can bring potential benefits when used by remanufacturers to accomplish a portfolio of remanufacturing tasks, and the risks they need to be aware of. This articulation represents contributions to knowledge as it will set out the underpinning of the future human-technology collaboration, which is key in the I4.0 realm.","","Remanufacturing, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, Systematic literature review","",""

To partially address some of these problems, this paper presents an approach for physically linking engineered cells to their digital footprint-we called it digital twinning.

This work reveals that too much research attention was invested in making data-driven models, as supposed to ensuring the quality of industrial data. Furthermore, the true challenge within the Industry 4.0 is with data communication and infrastructure problems, not so significantly on developing modelling techniques. Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry. The novelty of this work is the current context of industrial energy savings was extended towards cutting-edge technologies for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this work proposes to standardize and modularize industrial data infrastructure for smart energy savings. This work also serves as a concise guideline for researchers and industrialists who are looking to implement advanced energy-saving systems.","","Digital twins, Data-driven energy savings, Artificial intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Internet of things (IoT), Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS)","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Teng2021.pdf",""

In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.","","Industry 4.0, Pi-Mind, Decision-making, Cyber-physical system, Cognitive models, Collective intelligence, Value system, Preference, Clone, Patented intelligence, Smart decision, Ontology","",""

Methods for this require both an appropriate choice of sensors, as well as algorithms capable of quickly and efficiently evaluating activity and workflow progress.In this paper we present such an algorithm, which provides activity and workflow recognition using both depth and RGB cameras as input. The algorithm's main purpose is to be used in an industrial training station, allowing novice workers to learn the necessary steps in assembling nordic ski products without the need for human supervision. We will describe how the algorithm recognizes predefined workflows in the sensor data, and present a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance on a real data recording of operators performing their work in an industrial setting.

Thanks to national government initiatives, incentives and subsidies have supported investments in innovative and digital technologies, giving also a positive impulse in the national economic growth. The greatest advantages of Industry 4.0 are the empowerment of sustainable growth, thanks to the optimization of resources, and the integration of the supply chain. Nevertheless, Industry 4.0 challenges industries on the organizational level, concerning the integration of these technologies with existing ones and the management of digital tools by dedicated qualified people. Steel industries have also absorbed the challenges and the advantages of Industry 4.0. Digital technologies are affecting the business model and supply chain of steel producers, pushing them to integrate themselves with their business partners. Industry 4.0 is definitely an opportunity of sustainable growth for the steel sector.","","","",""

Missions are challenging from a scientific and technological point of view and, at the same time, are addressing problems and providing results that are understandable by common people. Missions are based on clear targets that can help mitigating grand challenges. Based on the results of the Italian Flagship Project Factories of the Future, this chapter proposes seven missions while identifying the societal impact, the technological and industrial challenges, and the barriers to be overcome. These missions cover topics such as circular economy, rapid and sustainable industrialisation, robotic assistant, factories for personalised medicine, internet of actions, factories close to the people, and turning ideas into products. The accomplishment of missions asks for the support of a proper research environment in terms of infrastructures to test and demonstrate the results to a wide public. Research infrastructures together with funding mechanisms will be better addressed in the next chapter of this book.","","","",""

This paper presents an inductive study of the “why and “how of BC-IoT systems through a Systematic Literature Review of 120 peer-reviewed studies. To capture the diverse nature of BC-IoT integration, we proposed and applied a multi-perspective framework to analyse the existing systems. Regarding their motivations, we studied the improvement objectives and technical problems that drive the integration of BC. Regarding the design, we captured the position of BC within IoT systems as well as the content and processes that IoT systems offload to BC. As these dimensions are not mutually exclusive, they constitute a rich and multi-angle view of BC-IoT integration. Based on these findings, we defined 10 archetypes of BC-IoT systems that embody the core patterns of usage and configuration of BC in IoT systems.","","Blockchain, Distributed ledger, Smart contract, Web of things, Internet of Things, Systematic review","",""

However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions. It is a technology-agnostic three-layered model, which reconciles existing understandings of DT under a common umbrella. We also derive an operational architecture as a possible implementation of the framework, which we demonstrate on two use cases. The large adoption of such a framework will draw a clear line between what is a DT and what is not, while establishing a high-level standard model for DT engineering.","","Digital Twin, Simulation, Framework, Anylogic","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Traore2021.pdf",""

Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures.","","BIM, Construction 4.0, Cybersecurity, Cyber-Physical Systems, Digitalization, Digital twins, Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT), Privacy, Confidentiality, Integrity, CIA Triad, Parkerian Hexad","",""

However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing.","","Energy efficiency, Internet of Things, IoT, Green Networking","",""

A more accurate assessment of the security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges (CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented CRs and TBs platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented CRs and TBs research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future of CRs and TBs. The taxonomy elaborates on the CRs/TBs dimensions, as well as, highlighting a diminishing differentiation between application areas.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Ukwandu2020.pdf",""

But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.","","Technology adoption barriers, Innovation, Non-adoption, Smart real estate, Disruptive digital technologies (DDTs), Managerial perspective","",""

The information leveraged through REOPs supports these users in reaching conclusive rent or buy decisions. Despite their promised utility, user perception about accepting online information through REOPs is unexplored. Using a comprehensive questionnaire and data collected from 65 users, the current study captures the users’ perception of REOPs. Risk, service, information, system, technology adoption model (RSISTAM) is proposed comprising of seven users’ perceptions: risk (PR), service quality (PSEQ), information quality (PIQ), and system quality (PSYQ) from the information systems success model, and usefulness (PU), ease of use (PEU) and behaviour to accept (BAU) from TAM. The results are analysed using the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach, which shows that PIQ, PSEQ and PEU are the causes and PR, PSYQ, PU and BAU are the effects. Among the criteria, the order of prominence is PEU > PSEQ > PIQ, and for net effects, the order is PU > BAU > PSYQ > PR. For addressing the causes, the REOP managers must provide more transparent, high quality and voluminous information to the users, focus on the system, services, and information qualities, and add more enjoyable, immersive and easy-to-use content through REOPs. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring user perceptions and proposing methods to improve the quality and reliability of REOPs in line with Real Estate 4.0 and industry 4.0 aims.","","Real estate online platforms (REOPs), User perception, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), SISQual approach, Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), RSISTAM","",""

In current cyber-physical systems, data are collected from pieces of manufacturing equipment and used to drive useful change and affect production output. The data gathered typically describe the operating state of the equipment, such as a machine tool, and can be provided using standard protocols. One such protocol, known as MTConnect, is becoming increasingly popular to collect data from machine tools. Other useful data can be collected from production personnel using a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to monitor process output, consumable usage, and operator productivity. However, MTConnect data and MES data usually reside in separate systems that may be proprietary and expensive. This paper describes the development and implementation of a new MES, powered by Android devices and cloud computing tools, that combines MTConnect data with production data collected from operators; the proposed MES is particularly suitable for small manufacturing enterprises, as it is low-cost and easily implementable. A case study using the MES to track a production run of titanium parts is presented, and data from the MES are correlated with MTConnect data from a machine tool. This work is integral to realizing a complete digital model of the shop floor, known as the Shop Floor Digital Twin, that can be used for production control and optimization.","","Manufacturing execution system, Android, MTConnect, CNC, Digital Twin, Cyber Physical Systems, Industry 4.0","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\UrbinaCoronado2018.pdf",""

While remaining on the same abstraction layer, we highlight a "method agility" requirement observed in commercial BPM consulting projects - concretely, it manifests as change requests for the modeling language or tool, from one lifecycle iteration to the next, leading to situations of "model value co-creation" as customer demands are assimilated in the modeling method. Based on a conceptualization of such situations, a lifecycle "plug-in" is proposed in the form of a methodology and associated tool support, allowing for responsive evolution of the adopted modeling method with impact on several lifecycle phases. Historical examples from the evolution of a BPM product are provided to illustrate and classify the demands that motivate the existence of this "lifecycle plug-in".","","","",""

The basic idea is the direct possibility of testing and debugging advanced logistics algorithms using a digital twin outside the production line. Since the digital twin requires a physical connection to a real line for its operation, this connection is substituted by a modular cyber-physical system (CPS), which replicates the same physical inputs and outputs as a real production line. Especially in fully functional production facilities, there is a trend towards optimizing logistics systems in order to increase efficiency and reduce idle time. Virtualization techniques in the form of a digital twin are standardly used for this purpose. The possibility of an initial test of the physical implementation of proposed optimization changes before they are fully implemented into operation is a pragmatic question that still resonates on the production side. Such concerns are justified because the proposed changes in the optimization of production logistics based on simulations from a digital twin tend to be initially costly and affect the existing functional production infrastructure. Therefore, we created a universal CPS based on requirements from our cooperating manufacturing companies. The model fully physically reproduces the real conditions of simulated production and verifies in advance the quality of proposed optimization changes virtually by the digital twin. Optimization costs are also significantly reduced, as it is not necessary to verify the optimization impact directly in production, but only in the physical model. To demonstrate the versatility of deployment, we chose a configuration simulating a robotic assembly workplace and its logistics.","","","",""

The data collected can be stored, for example, into private, public, or hybrid cloud service infrastructure or distributed service by utilizing data platforms. The stored data can be used when implementing services, such as building automation (BAS). Cloud services, IoT sensors, and data platforms can face several kinds of cybersecurity attack vectors such as adversarial, AI-based, DoS/DDoS, insider attacks. If a perpetrator can penetrate the defenses of a data platform, she can cause significant harm to the system. For example, the perpetrator can disrupt a building’s automatic heating system or break the heating equipment by using a suitable attack vector for a data platform. This chapter focuses on examining possibilities to protect cloud storage or data platforms from incoming cyberattacks by using, for instance, artificial-intelligence-based tools or trained neural networks that can detect and prevent typical attack vectors.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Vaehaekainu2020.pdf",""

It is noted that the professional competence of the staff of large systems, the observance of safety standards significantly affects the processes of control of emergence of critical situations. At each stage of the life cycle of a complex system, large amounts of data are generated that are used to solve management, control, and decision-making tasks. To increase the efficiency of these procedures, it is proposed to use big data technologies.

Researchers across the world have been working on a spectrum of issues pertaining to the field of microgrids, ranging from control, operation and management aspects for the islanded, grid connected modes and the seamless transition aspects, to the protection and the power quality issues. These proposed solutions need rigorous testing under a wide range of dynamic conditions, before actual field deployment under diverse environments. Thus there needs to be a focus to develop fast, safe, accurate and reliable testing methods. Accuracy, flexibility, scalability, compactness, ease of implementation and economic viability are some of the common parameters which are used in the benchmarking of a testing methodology. These objectives are mostly in conflict with each other and thus need fresh out of the box solutions for the design and development of the testing methodologies. The chapter presents the fundamentals of and a comparison between the various testing techniques - ranging from off-line to real-time (RT) simulations, rapid controller prototyping, hardware in the loop (HIL): both the signal level (CHIL) and power level (PHIL), RT power level emulation, test-bed platforms, hybrid approaches/combinations of these techniques and novel solutions such as digital twin, blockchain and internet of things (IoT) based approaches. The future challenges in the area of microgrid testing are also discussed.","","","",""

This paper proposes a decision-making framework for a multi-product hybrid layout production system under stochastic disruptions using a simulation model. The simulation model will act as a digital twin of the physical system, which helps to proactively visualize and analyze several key performance parameters of the system and make informed decisions. The objective of this paper is to identify the best sequence from predefined sequences for jobs, which maximize profit, throughput, and minimize cost, and make-span. Several experimentation cases are developed to analyze the performance of the system under different scenarios of disruptions and make strategic decisions such as investing in new machines, prioritizing products, and rescheduling of products.","","Industry 4.0, Decision-making, Simulation, Uncertainties, Digital twin","",""

At this juncture, it is essential to establish a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research. In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical, biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv) precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data, compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i) cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security and privacy schemes.","","","",""

To understand the barriers which hinder or even stop DT is essential for the successful transformation. Our study aims at identifying the barriers on the basis of 46 expert interviews. These practical insights are further used to develop a research agenda. To determine the research gaps, we conduct a literature review on the topics mentioned by the interviewees.

The availability of real-time data makes the concept of a “rolling value proposition possible by identifying changes in operating requirements and applying them digitally. Real-time data analysis can be used to monitor margin management and “translate the implications of change to short-term profitability throughout the network. Digital twinning provides data on operational efficiency; the data output can be used immediately to improve asset productivity and in the longer-term to make specification changes.

The aggregation of performance data identifies the efficiency of the producibility infrastructure and identifies requirements for changes in partner contributions and, possibly, value chain positioning.

The approach being taken by IKEA to explore its strategic direction suggests a pensive what and why and when and how and where and who.

IKEA are clearly taking a very broad view of the opportunity space they are considering. In retrospect General Electric appears not to have taken such an approach.

The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.","","Industries;Digital twin;Data models;Bibliographies;Oils;Market research;Companies;Digitalization;digital twin (DT);industry 4.0;extended reality;industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);oil and gas","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Wanasinghe2020.pdf",""

In this paper, we focus on the vertical integration to implement flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. We first propose a brief framework that incorporates industrial wireless networks, cloud, and fixed or mobile terminals with smart artifacts such as machines, products, and conveyors. Then, we elaborate the operational mechanism from the perspective of control engineering, that is, the smart artifacts form a self-organized system which is assisted with the feedback and coordination blocks that are implemented on the cloud and based on the big data analytics. In addition, we outline the main technical features and beneficial outcomes and present a detailed design scheme.

This paper provides a different perspective by examining relevant challenges and providing examples of some less-talked-about yet essential topics, such as hybrid systems, redefining advanced manufacturing, basic building blocks of new manufacturing, ecosystem readiness, and technology scalability. The first major challenge is to (re-)define what the manufacturing of the future will be, if we wish to: ① raise public awareness of new manufacturing’s economic and societal impacts, and ② garner the unequivocal support of policy-makers. The second major challenge is to recognize that manufacturing in the future will consist of systems of hybrid systems of human and robotic operators; additive and subtractive processes; metal and composite materials; and cyber and physical systems. Therefore, studying the interfaces between constituencies and standards becomes important and essential. The third challenge is to develop a common framework in which the technology, manufacturing business case, and ecosystem readiness can be evaluated concurrently in order to shorten the time it takes for products to reach customers. Integral to this is having accepted measures of “scalability of non-information technologies. The last, but not least, challenge is to examine successful modalities of industry–academia–government collaborations through public–private partnerships. This article discusses these challenges in detail.","","Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, Ecosystem, Industry 4.0, Intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things, Manufacturing innovation institutes, National Network for Manufacturing Innovation","",""

The digital twin theory is one of the most outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of the reward function by using the results of the proposed data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Wang2019.pdf",""

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keywords frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.","","Smart manufacturing, Intelligent manufacturing, Industry 4.0, Human–cyber–physical system (HCPS)","",""

With access to data from multiple sources, manufacturers can provide on-demand and customised products. However, existing research of smart customisation has focused on data generated from the physical world, not virtual models. As physical data is constrained by what has already occurred, it is limited in the identification of new areas to improve customer satisfaction. A new technology called digital twin aims to achieve this integration of physical and virtual entities. Incorporation of digital twin into the paradigm of existing data-driven smart customisation will make the process more responsive, adaptable and predictive.

AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks.

Today's surveillance practices depend primarily upon many software technologies that collect, store and process personal data for the purposes of influence, management, protection or detection. The identification and categorisation of data have thus emerged as the technical signature of surveillance. An individual has many identities belonging to different contexts of his/her life, but in this paper, we explore the relationship between surveillance and identity in virtual contexts only. We argue that an understanding of identity purely as data is fundamental to understanding surveillance. We propose abstract general definitions of surveillance and identity that together create a conceptual framework, capturing key features common to many disparate surveillance situations. Our work concludes that the essence of surveillance is that of a surveillance context, which is precisely and solely defined by the availability of data about the behaviour and identity of its entities. The data that distinguishes the entities of the context we call identifiers; we explore the creation, provenance, comparison and transformation of identifiers. Abstractly, surveillance is a process that tests for properties of data, and sorts identifiers into categories.","","Surveillance, Identifier, Monitoring, Software, Social sorting, Digital society","",""

This means the adaptation of a data-driven manufacturing model, which includes the horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain and the management of data across the whole product life cycle. Currently companies face two major problems in this transformation of their IT architectures: 1) There are multiple reference architectures for Industrie 4.0, whose suitability has not been evaluated in a straightforward way. 2) There are no maturity models to objectively assess data-driven IT architectures. In this work we address these problems by providing an overview of Industrie 4.0 features in multiple reference architectures and developing a maturity model for IT architectures for data-driven manufacturing. We first give an overview of the current maturity models with aspects of data-driven manufacturing. Based on this overview we survey three reference architectures for Industrie 4.0: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0, and the Stuttgart IT Architecture for Manufacturing. We analyze and assess each approach and define maturity levels for data-driven manufacturing to guide companies in the adaption process of Industrie 4.0, as well as criteria for meeting these levels.","","Maturity Model, Industrie 4.0, Industrial Internet, Reference Architectures, Digital Twin, Edge Analytics","",""

Still, it is vulnerable to the backdoor attack because of lacking transparency, which results in unexpected results for the input with a trigger. Backdoors can remain hidden in neural networks for a long time, and the networks implanted with backdoors can still make correct judgments when receiving normal inputs. The most common way to implant backdoors into neural networks is to perform trigger inserting and label modifying in the training dataset so that the trained models naturally carry backdoors. This paper proposes a novel defense method against neural network backdoor attacks, referred to as the backdoor filter. The defense is deployed on the dataset used for model training: It first blurs the dataset images and then performs sharpening operations on the obtained processed intermediate parts. This processed dataset is then used as input to the neural network for model training. We use three different types of backdoor attacks to validate our approach, evaluating the prediction accuracy and the attack's success rate after our processing. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the success rate of the corresponding attacks and effectively defend against backdoor attacks.","","Training;Deep learning;Digital twin;Digital images;Resists;Implants;Filtering algorithms;Artificial intelligence security;Deep neural network;Backdoor attack;Backdoor attack defense","",""

Especially when systems are safety-critical and demand reliability, new methods and tools are thus essential to support the reusability aspect in the development process.

Our findings reveal that users spend more time on the website and explore more pages when users can (vs. cannot) customize the quantity of ads. Most interestingly, users engage more with the website when given the possibility of AQC than when experiencing a website that is ad-free by default. Additionally, users respond particularly positively to AQC when using mobile (vs. stationary) devices.

Recently, the Digital Twin concept was launched as a tool for improving geometrical quality and reduce costs by using real time control and optimization of products and production systems. The Digital Twin for geometry assurance is created together with the product and the production systems in early design phases. When full production starts, the purpose of the Digital Twin turns towards optimization of the geometrical quality by small changes in the assembly process. To reach its full potential, the Digital Twin concept is depending on high quality input data. In line with Internet of Things and Big Data, the problem is rather to extract appropriate data than to find data. In this paper, an inspection strategy serving the Digital Twin is given. Necessary input data describing form and shape of individual parts, and how this data should be collected, stored and utilized is described.","","","",""

This paper presents a survey among researchers and engineers with expertise in variation management confirming the interest of digital twins in this area. The survey shows, however, a gap between future research interest in academia and industry, identifying a larger need in industry. This indicates that there are some barriers in the industry to overcome before the benefits of a digital twin for variation management and geometry assurance can be fully capitalized on in an industrial context. To identify those barriers and challenges, an extensive interview study with engineers from eight different companies in the manufacturing sectors was accomplished. The analysis identifies industrial challenges in the areas of system-level, simulation working process, management issues, and education. One of the main challenges is to keep the 3D models fully updated, including keeping track of changes during the product development process and also feedback changes during full production to the development engineers.

Capabilities are needed for collecting and processing large volumes of real-time data generated from manufacturing machines and processes as well as for diagnosing the root cause of identified defects, predicting their progression, and forecasting maintenance actions proactively to minimize unexpected machine down times. Although cloud computing enables ubiquitous and instant remote access to scalable information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures and high volume data storage, it has limitations in latency-sensitive applications such as high performance computing and real-time stream analytics. The emergence of fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent radical changes in the way sensing systems, along with ICT infrastructures, collect and analyze large volumes of real-time data streams in geographically distributed environments. Ultimately, such technological approaches enable machines to function as an agent that is capable of intelligent behaviors such as automatic fault and failure detection, self-diagnosis, and preventative maintenance scheduling. The objective of this research is to introduce a fog-enabled architecture that consists of smart sensor networks, communication protocols, parallel machine learning software, and private and public clouds. The fog-enabled architecture will have the potential to enable large-scale, geographically distributed online machine and process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis that require low latency and high bandwidth in the context of data-driven cyber-manufacturing systems.","","","",""

The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.","","Energy consumption;Analytical models;Digital twin;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Production facilities;Data models;artificial intelligence;intelligent factory;digital twins;energy consumption;deep learning","",""

This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample’s ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.","","Integrated circuits;Digital twin;Computed tomography;Inspection;Packaging;Hardware;Integrated circuit packaging;sample preparation;hardware assurance;physical inspection;digital twin;THz;X-ray tomography","",""

This work proposes a data-driven approach to utilize digital transformation methods to automate smart manufacturing systems. This is fundamentally enabled by using a digital twin to represent manufacturing cells, simulate system behaviors, predict process faults, and adaptively control manipulated variables. First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a network of interfaces between the environments is designed and implemented to enable communication between the digital world and physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel combination between data science and manufacturing industries.","","Smart manufacturing systems, Robotics, Artificial intelligence, Digital transformation, Virtual commissioning","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Xia2021.pdf",""

We have elected to use five of these questions to structure our arguments and tried to be unbiased for the selection of the sources of information and for the discussions around the key issues. It is our intention that this article will spark and encourage continued debate and discussion around these topics.","","Industrial Revolution, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Technology-driven, Value-driven","",""

During the APT attack process, attackers often use advanced techniques and tools, thus, causing many difficulties for information security systems. In fact, to detect the APT attacks, intrusion detection systems cannot rely on one technique or method but often combine multiple techniques and methods. In addition, the approach for APT attack detection using behavior analysis and evaluation techniques is facing many difficulties due to the lack of characteristic data of attack campaigns. For the above reasons, in this paper, we propose a method for APT attack detection based on a multi-layer analysis. The multi-layer analysis technique in our proposal computes and analyzes various events in Network Traffic to detect and synthesize abnormal signs and behaviors in order to make conclusions about the existence of APT in the system. Specifically, in our proposal, we will use serial 3 main layers for the APT attack detection process including i) Detecting APT attacks based on analyzing abnormal connection; ii) Detecting APT attacks based on analyzing and evaluating Suricata log; iii) Detecting APT attacks based on analyzing behavior profiles that are compiled from layers (i) and (ii). To achieve these goals, the multi-layer analysis technique for APT attack detection will perform 2 main tasks: i) Analyzing and evaluating components of Network Traffic based on abnormal signs and behaviors. ii) building and classifying behavior profile based on each component of network traffic. In the experimental section, we will compare and evaluate the effectiveness of the APT attack detection process of each layer in the multi-layer analysis model using machine learning. Experimental results have shown that the APT attack detection method based on analyzing behavior profile has yielded better results than individual detection methods on all metrics. The research results shown in the paper not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the multilayer analysis model for APT attack detection but also provide a novel approach for detecting several other cyber-attack techniques.","","","",""

Further, to tackle such circumstances, conformation to quality has become a must in Agriculture Supply Chain (ASC). Agro-stakeholders have tried to accomplish this demand through the integration of technology in ASC. One such technology is blockchain, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India. Fueled by this motivation, we aim to investigate the significant barriers for blockchain adoption in Indian ASC. The constructs are identified through a comprehensive literature search and opinion of domain experts from five agro-organizations, academia, and agro-stakeholders. Further identified construct is modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL approach, which not only interrogates interrelationship amongst identified constructs but also evaluates the intensity of the relationship between them. The identified constructs are also clustered into a suitable group using Fuzzy-MICMAC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. The results reveal that “lack of government regulation and lack of trust among agro-stakeholder to use blockchain are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Indian ASC. Moreover, the managerial implication about the results is also provided, which will be useful to government and related agencies to take suitable measures to overcome these obstacles for increasing the rate of blockchain adoption in Indian ASC.","","Agriculture Supply Chain, Blockchain Barriers, ISM, DEMATEL","",""

We analyzed the additional benefits that economic actors can gain from using the DO. This object is fairly well-understood from a technical point of view; although there are many options for its definition, its basic composition and functionality are defined clearly, but currently in the economic science DO has not yet been enough considered. The DO, which first appeared as a digital twin has not been properly explored by economic science. The ontological analysis of the DO within the existing conceptual framework of economic science are presented. The DO is comprehensively examined to determine whether all the properties and characteristics of the DO are described by modern economic language or whether there is a need to introduce new concepts and categories to describe such objects. We propose to analyze the DO in terms of such economic categories as goods, innovation process, the system of division of labor, the role of market participants in the creation and use of the DO, intellectual property, etc.","","","",""

Our literature survey pinpoints that systems scalability, interoperability, information security, and data quality domains are among those where many challenges occur. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a new breed of technology characterized by decentralized verifiability, transparency, data privacy, integrity, high availability, and data protection properties. Although many researchers leveraged BCT to empower various aspects of industrial manufacturing systems, there is no study dedicated to addressing the challenges impacting the manufacturing systems compliant with the ISA95 standard. Thereby, our study aims to fill the identified research gap systematically. This paper thoroughly analyzes the challenges hampering the ISA95-CTS and SMMS and methodically addresses them with corresponding BCT capabilities. Furthermore, this paper also discusses various aspects, including the weaknesses, of BCT convergence to ISA95-CTS and SMMS.","","","",""

With recent developments in cloud computing and the proliferation of big data, machine learning approaches have begun to deliver invaluable insights, which drives adaptive control of battery management systems (BMS) with improved performance. In this paper, a general framework utilizing an end-edge-cloud architecture for a cloud-based BMS is proposed, with the composition and function of each link described. Cloud-based BMS leverages from the Cyber Hierarchy and Interactional Network (CHAIN) framework to provide multi-scale insights, more advanced and efficient algorithms can be used to realize the state-of-X estimation, thermal management, cell balancing, fault diagnosis and other functions of traditional BMS system. The battery intelligent monitoring and management platform can visually present battery performance, store working-data to help in-depth understanding of the microscopic evolutionary law, and provide support for the development of control strategies. Currently, the cloud-based BMS requires more effects on the multi-scale integrated modeling methods and remote upgrading capability of the controller, these two aspects are very important for the precise management and online upgrade of the system. The utility of this approach is highlighted not only for automotive applications, but for any battery energy storage system, providing a holistic framework for future intelligent and connected battery management.","","Battery, CHAIN, Cloud, Battery management system, SOX estimation, end-edge-cloud architecture","",""

However, current verification mechanisms cannot verify the correctness of search results for semantically related queries in mutual distrust scenarios. Moreover, most secure semantic searching schemes still perform exact matching on ciphertext after query expansion, then directly accumulate the weights of the matched keywords as similarity measurements to rank the documents, resulting in the search results with unsatisfied ranking. In this paper, we propose a secure heuristic semantic searching scheme, in which a privacy-preserving word nonlinear matching (PPWNM) method is developed, and a blockchain-based verification is designed to obtain trustworthy search results with high retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we describe several retrieval heuristics and formulate them as a word nonlinear matching problem, then transform it to the PPWNM problem for calculating the similarity measurement between the query and document so that the highly accurate ranked results can be obtained. Also we design a blockchain-based verification mechanism in which the blockchain nodes utilize the proofs generated during the matching process to verify the correctness of the search results and reach a consensus to ensure the trustworthy results and fair payment between the participants in a mutual distrust model. Our security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is secure and has higher accuracy compared with the existing other schemes.","","Blockchain-based verification, Retrieval heuristic, Word nonlinear matching, Secure semantic searching","",""

As SCADA and Modbus are easily used for control and monitoring, the interconnection and operational efficiency between systems are highly improved; however, such connectivity inevitably exposes the system to the open network environment. There are many network security threats and vulnerabilities in a SCADA network system.

To update the data about emergency situation, a real-time data sharing is mandatory. However, regular message transmission by various drones may not only overwhelm a central server but it also causes congestion on the network. It is mandatory to reduce messaging cost and congestion. This paper presents a fog-assisted congestion avoidance approach for Smooth Message Dissemination (SMD). We present a message forwarding algorithm for congestion avoidance to select the appropriate next-hop node using layered model. This model is based on various layers having drones. In first phase, it looks for an appropriate drone in a layer near the fog server for message forwarding. In next step, the drone is identified in nearby layers to forward the emergency message to next-hop to further locate the group head as per priority. It is a drone that has less distance towards fog server and inform in its one-hop circle. It can stop forwarding message after delivering it to fog server. Finally, the fog server disseminates information timely towards upper layers for necessary actions for emergency situations. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations using NS 2.35. Results prove the dominance of SMD over counterparts in terms of messaging overhead, packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption and average delay. Proposed SMD improves PDR by 85% and message overhead cost by 91% as compared to counterparts.","","Internet of drones, Smooth message dissemination, Fog computing, Congestion avoidance, Emergency messages","",""

Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links, it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","","Satellites;Interference;Satellite broadcasting;Physical layer security;Optimization;Space vehicles;Iterative methods;Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks;cybertwin;digital twin;secure transmission;beamforming","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Yin2021.pdf",""

The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.","","Irrigation;Logic gates;Marine vehicles;Valves;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Anomaly detection;CPS live modeling;RNN based Digital Twin;CPS cyber security","",""

CPPS is the foundation of a long-term transformation of energy management that will fundamentally alter the perspective and application pattern of traditional energy research. The strong interactions between systems in a CPPS introduce new challenges in maintaining high supply security, as new factors can affect the overall security of the power system. Such factors include cybersecurity, the behaviour and constraints of neighbouring energy systems, and the dynamics of interactions between the various systems. Integrating computing, communications, and control at all levels of electrical energy generation, transmission, distribution, utilisation, and storage in CPPS increases vulnerabilities and complicates security. Security studies must reflect the characteristics of the CPPS infrastructure in actual testing environments that support the interfacing of real-world hardware devices. CPPS testbeds are effective in this context because they provide testing capabilities for evaluating the synergistic relationship between physical and virtual components in controlled environments. Security-oriented CPPS testbeds are invaluable for performing cybersecurity and cyberattack analyses, identifying system threats and vulnerabilities in various layers of CPPS, implementing intrusion detection and prevention algorithms, and evaluating the efficacy of mitigation techniques without imposing excessive economic burdens or posing safety risks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CPPS testbeds from the standpoint of the physical power system layer, cyber system layer, and cyber-physical fusion layer. Following a brief description of the importance of testbeds for cybersecurity research in CPPS, and a brief classification of existing CPPS testbeds for cyberattacks, and cybersecurity analysis in CPPS is presented. A detailed overview of the outlook for future CPPS testbeds in terms of communication, control, computing, and educational perspective is provided.

The seamless integration of control, communication, and computing operations allow CPPS to be fully monitored and controlled. Threats, vulnerabilities, and catastrophic attacks will intrude as CPPS monitoring, protection, and control functions advance. For the CPPS to operate safely, securely, and efficiently, sustainable cybersecurity solutions must be developed, and the power grid's reliability and resilience must be maintained even when exposed to unfavorable network conditions. While more distributed and renewable energy sources are connected to the grid, cybersecurity helps to ensure the supply of electricity is sustainable and of high quality. The validation of such sustainable cybersecurity analysis goes beyond the traditional power grid network analysis, which means that the test should integrate the physical and cyber system behavior and respond to the network attacks. To analyze the cybersecurity and cyberattacks in the practical CPPS, comprehensive and realistic CPPS testbeds are needed. The heterogeneous nature of the CPPS concept urges multidisciplinary testbeds with various functions and capabilities to evaluate the new cyber-attacks, vulnerabilities, and threats in CPPS. Using this CPPS testbed framework, the different types of cyber-attack can be detected, and detection algorithm can be evaluated, and helps to enhance the development of sustainable cybersecurity defenses for realistic CPPS environment with the increasingly dense integration of distributed energy resources (DERs).

The necessity of testbeds for cyberattacks and sustainable cybersecurity analysis in CPPS are then described. Finally, the NIST framework for CPS, CPPS domains, and research areas are presented.

It extends the scope and depth of resources sharing and enables society-based manufacturing integration. SharedMfg is complex and is still in its infancy. It demands encouraging research to clarify the concept and understand the key operations. In this paper, the SharedMfg is analysed along with two significant manufacturing evolutional trends, (i.e., Servitization and Industry 4.0). Based on this, to reduce the complexities in operations, the concept and definition of SharedMfg are presented on the basis of a service hierarchy that includes Product-Service System, Configuration-Service System and Resource-Service System. At the same time, this paper looks SharedMfg as an independent socialization manufacturing mode (e.g. compared with Cloud Manufacturing), and also, the benefit in contributing to the integration of the manufacturing and service sectors is revealed. However, apart from the complexity, high-degree dynamics and uncertainties related to service operations challenge the application of SharedMfg as well. To meet both requirements, based on the construction of a three-dimensional SharedMfg Service (SMS) modelling framework, a hybrid integration and interoperable SharedMfg architecture is proposed to ensure the provision of SMS in efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, a dynamic SMS scheduling method in support of the technologies of Complex Network Analysis is presented. A case study associated with the networked fabrication of an assistive glove is applied by implementing a prototype system to validate the proposed frameworks and methods. Finally, an experiment for evaluating the efficiency of service matching is carried out to prove the SharedMfg that can provide better performance than Cloud Manufacturing and Social Manufacturing.","","Sharing economy, Shared manufacturing, Service-oriented manufacturing, Cloud manufacturing, Service modelling, Service scheduling","",""

Enterprises need cost-effective, intuitive solutions to benefit from Industry 4.0 involving minimal efforts and integration costs. This study presents a new approach increasing the flexibility of manufacturing operations including robot trajectory, processing, and quality control. The results are tested in an industrial platform 4.0 installed in the laboratory. Our approach is to transform a rigid production system into an agile production system. For this, we break down the manufacturing process and reorganize it by programming core modules while maintaining the existing control structure but upgrading its programmable function to the Manufacturing Execution System Layer. Thus, the production manager can use the developed modules connected by flows to orchestrate a new production plan in a short time compared with the traditional approach.","","Industry 4.0, Flexible manufacturing systems, Computer integrated manufacturing, Modularity, Modular process orchestration, Shop floor control system, Process control","",""

The information security problems of cyber-physical systems require the development of a new security methodology. In this paper, it is proposed to interpret the security of cyber-physical systems as the preservation of the sustainable functioning of the cyber-physical system in the context of a targeted destructive impact on its information components. Cybersecurity methodology extends the objects of protection from data or key information to control systems as telecommunications equipment and actuators in the energy and manufacturing.

This paper aims to focus on identifying challenges that pose knowledge risks and pos-sible actions to overcome them. Particularly, the focus is on knowledge risks emerging out of an organizational and technical perspective. These risks can also act as a barrier for technology adaption in industry, hence it is important to provide an overview of existing research, synthesize it with one another, and translate it to unexplored gaps. Therefore, a structured literature review is conducted. It is found that challenges are often related to topics of data security, data analytics, training, and trustful relation-ships.

This empirical study employs a push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework (a paradigm that originated from the human migration theory), to examine why users would switch from the traditional paper-based work pattern to land information system (LIS) applications. Based upon the relevant technology adoption theories, a couple of determinants have been integrated into the PPM framework. The land sectors undergoing digital transformation in China have been chosen for such analysis and investigation. Data collected from 208 public servants at administrative county level in China are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses, using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The results show that push factors (such as dissatisfaction with traditional work patterns), and pulling factors (such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective norms) positively affect switching intention. Meanwhile, mooring factors such as inertia hinder switching behavior. Based on these findings, several behavior interventions and land information usage policy suggestions are put forward to promote the digital transformation in land sectors.","","Land information system (LIS), Information technology innovation, Technology acceptance, Users’ switching behavior, Push-pull-mooring","",""

To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software.

To solve the above issues, this article combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then, hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive throughput and latency performance.","","","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Zhang2020abc.pdf",""

Previous research efforts on addressing the bottlenecks primarily emphasize on the analysis of data from the physical job-shop, but with little connection and convergence with its virtual models and simulated data. By introducing digital twin (DT), further convergence between physical and virtual spaces of the job-shop can be achieved, which greatly enables dynamic scheduling. DT fuses both real and simulated data to provide more information for the prediction of machine availability on one hand; and on the other hand, it helps to detect disturbances through comparing the physical machine with its continuously updated digital counterpart in real time, triggering timely rescheduling when needed. It also enables comprehensive performance evaluation for rescheduling using multiple-dimension models, which can describe geometric properties, physics parameters and behaviors of the machines. In the paper, a five-dimension DT for a machine in the job-shop is introduced first, then the DT-based machine availability prediction, disturbance detection and performance evaluation methods are explored. Based on this, a DT-enhanced dynamic scheduling methodology is proposed. A scheduling process of making hydraulic valves in a machining job-shop is taken as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.","","Digital Twin, Dynamic scheduling, Rescheduling, Modeling","C:\Users\LocalAdmin\OneDrive\01_Promotion\02_Paper\2022 Digital Twin for SoS Security\00_LR\01_Search_Repository\data\pdfs\Zhang2021a.pdf",""

In the existing literature, scholars focus on a local dot, such as: technology, function, elements and application based on IIP. However, there is a lack of an overall framework to study the top-level planning of IIP implementation from a systematic perspective. Moreover, there are few studies on the detailed path and steps of IIP implementation in a specific industry. The research objective is to study the general model, reference architecture, service evaluation index system, implementation path, application verification, etc. for IIP which meets the needs of industry on the basis of existing theory and industrial practice, and to provide reference for government and industry planning, design, implementation and promotion of IIP. From a case study, the comprehensive performance rate of comprehensive ability for IIP in a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry enterprise is calculated. It can reflect the comprehensive ability for IIP in enterprise from the ability of the IIP’s resource management, platform technology, industrial application, and etc. In addition, the general model, reference architecture, implementation path and service evaluation system of IIP can improve the enterprise's resource management ability, platform service ability, industrial application ability, and enhance the core value of the enterprise and increase benefits.","","Industrial Internet, Industrial Internet platform, Industrial Internet of things (IIoT), Internet of things (IoT), Smart manufacturing, Intelligent manufacturing","",""

With more joint applications of both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing, assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally, a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are discussed to provide guidelines for future applications.","","BIM, Building automation and robotics, Lifecycle information flow, BIMfAR framework, Robotic construction","",""

To meet this demand, a promising strategy is to introduce cloud computing and digital twin techniques into the healthcare systems, where the cloud server is employed for storing healthcare data and offering efficient query services, and the digital twin is used for building digital representation for patients and leverages the query services of the cloud server to monitor healthcare states of patients. Although several cloud computing and digital twin based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been proposed, none of them has considered the data privacy issue, yet the leakage of the private healthcare information may cause catastrophic losses to patients. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving similarity query based healthcare monitoring scheme over digital twin cloud platform, named PSim-DTH. Specifically, we first formalize a similarity query based healthcare monitoring model over digital twin cloud platform. Then, we deploy a partition-based tree (PB-tree) to index the healthcare data and introduce matrix encryption to propose a privacy-preserving PB-tree based similarity range query (PSRQ) algorithm. Based on PSRQ algorithm, we propose our PSim-DTH scheme. Both security analysis and performance evaluation are extensively conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed PSim-DTH scheme is really privacy-preserving and efficient.","","Cloud computing;Digital twin;Medical services;Partitioning algorithms;Encryption;Servers;Security","",""

In this paper, boundary temperature is defined as safe inlet temperature and optimal oil transportation temperature. The intelligent supervisory control and data acquisition system was used to collect the production data of an oilfield in Western China in real-time. The heavy oil transportation pipeline was divided into 9 types through big data analysis. The safe inlet temperature under different conditions was determined by flow loop experiments. Then the total heat transfer coefficient was corrected by the least square method, and the optimal oil transportation temperature was calculated by the mathematical model. The results indicated that the relationship of the temperature drop along the pipeline could be more accurately predicted by the modified total heat transfer coefficient. Heavy oil field gathering and transportation system had low-temperature transportation potential in summer and winter. Liquid production, water cut, and the ambient temperature had a significant effect on the temperature gradient and safe inlet temperature. The heavy oil with high liquid production and high water cut had the greatest potential for low-temperature transportation. An oilfield intelligent control and management scheme is proposed to effectively guide heavy oil production. This study is of great significance to guide the optimization of operation parameters of heavy oil field gathering and transportation system, realize energy saving and consumption reduction, and ensure the efficient and stable operation of the pipeline.","","Internet of Things, Flow loop experiment, Operation parameters optimization, Intelligent control and management, Energy saving and consumption reduction","",""

The resulting CIs networks are huge and complex, which have inadvertently called for the integration of other technologies such as the internet for efficiency. The integration of such unsecured technologies and the advent of new computing paradigms such as IoT (internet of things) and Cloud computing which are being integrated into current industrial environments, giving rise to Industry 4.0 have further expanded the attack surface. This chapter considers a new breed of security attacks, crypto-viral attacks (crypto mining and crypto ransomware attacks), which target both the production and control networks of CIs. The authors model these attacks and evaluate their impacts. Such modeling is crucial in understanding the extent of the scope and detection capabilities of the first line of defense (intrusion detection and prevention systems), and possible avenues for mitigation strategies are suggested.","","","",""

Advancements in digital technologies are unleashing innovations that provide an opportunity to transform the engineering practice. Digital engineering is the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) initiative to transform the way it designs, develops, delivers, operates, and sustains complex systems in a formidable and changing threat environment. It is defined as “an integrated digital approach that uses authoritative sources of systems’ data and models as a continuum across disciplines to support lifecycle activities from concept through disposal. This paper sets the strategic direction for the digital engineering vision, in which five strategic goals are presented to guide DoD’s transformation efforts. This paper also describes the digital engineering initiatives that are in progress across the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Air Force, Army, and Navy. While these efforts have begun to realize initial benefits, challenges and next steps are also presented in order to realize the vision.","","","",""

Both machines and managers are daily confronted with decision making involving a massive input of data and customization in the manufacturing process. The ability to predict the need for maintenance of assets at a specific future moment is one of the main challenges in this scope. The possibility of performing predictive maintenance contributes to enhancing machine downtime, costs, control, and quality of production. We observed that surveys and tutorials about Industry 4.0 focus mainly on addressing data analytics and machine learning methods to change production procedures, so not comprising predictive maintenance methods and their organization. In this context, this article presents a systematic literature review of initiatives of predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0, identifying and cataloging methods, standards, and applications. As the main contributions, this survey discusses the current challenges and limitations in predictive maintenance, in addition to proposing a novel taxonomy to classify this research area considering the needs of the Industry 4.0. We concluded that computer science, including artificial intelligence and distributed computing fields, is more and more present in an area where engineering was the dominant expertise, so detaching the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address Industry 4.0 effectively.","","Industry 4.0, Predictive Maintenance, Remaining Useful Life, Conditional-based maintenance, Artificial intelligence","",""
