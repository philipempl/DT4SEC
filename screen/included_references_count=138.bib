However, this makes these systems more and more connected and part of a networked system. This can provide an entry point for attackers to infiltrate the system and cause damage with potentially catastrophic consequences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin-based security framework for ICS that consists of two parts: attack detection and attack mitigation. In this framework we deploy an intrusion detection system in digital domain that can detect attacks in a timely manner. Then, using our mitigation method, we keep the system stable with acceptable performance during the attack. Additionally, we implement our framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks.},

Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry.},

Among the most significant of those systems are industrial control systems (ICS) consisting of many cyber physical components, and smart grids are a prominent example of ICS, whose failures have potential to cause major disruptions in all aspects of our daily lives. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart grid cybersecurity standards, and review major threats to smart grid environments at the physical, network and application layers. In order to overcome the current lack of standards for security evaluation of smart grids, we propose a digital twins based approach for the complete life cycle of a smart grid, which accurately models the functioning of the physical grid and avoids service disruptions caused by running security tests on the actual grid. A digital twins based approach is promising to provide a common ground for the development of standardized models for continuous and comprehensive penetration testing of smart grids.},

A limited number of researchers consider integrating process measurements. However, in complex systems, process variable changes could result from different combinations of abnormal occurrences. This paper examines recent advances in intrusion detection algorithms, their limitations, challenges and the status of their application in critical infrastructures. We also introduce the discussion on the similarities and conflicts observed in the development of machine learning tools and techniques for fault diagnosis and cybersecurity in the protection of complex systems and the need to establish a clear difference between them. As a case study, we discuss special characteristics in nuclear power control systems and the factors that constraint the direct integration of security algorithms. Moreover, we discuss data reliability issues and present references and direct URL to recent open-source data repositories to aid researchers in developing data-driven ICS intrusion detection systems.},

The increase in the penetration of IoT has opened the doors for attackers with now even more surface area prone to attacks. The more machines connected the more the data is exchanged which implies more exposure of information which could be confidential and sensitive. Manufacturing units are the first line of defense in safeguarding a country’s capabilities. The information leaked through these channels is not only economically disastrous but also a serious concern for the security of a nation. There is a growing need to keep a check on the information that could be leaked. Cybersecurity plays an important role in preventing the misuse of the data collected through millions of devices nowadays.

Its outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication, consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System Manufacturing.},

This chapter overviews the engineering process of C-CPSs, typically long-running technical systems, such as industrial manufacturing systems and continuous processing systems. This chapter also covers major areas of requirements that include: (a) processes with intensive generation of engineering artifacts; (b) challenges regarding dependencies and complexity of engineering artifacts, stemming from variants of a product and the associated production process for a family of products; (c) management of model and consistency rules for dependencies between model parts; (d) the internationalization of the engineering process with partners on different levels of trust; and (e) the security of the engineering processes, such as confidentiality of engineering plans, and the security of the systems to be engineered, such as security aspects in the design phase.

For selected requirement areas, the chapter discusses several approaches for quality improvement from business informatics that addresses important classes of requirements, but introduces new complexity to the engineering process. Therefore, the chapter reviews information security improvement approaches for engineering processes, including the consideration of new security requirements stemming from risks introduced by advanced informatics solutions. Finally, the chapter provides an overview on the book parts and the contributions of the chapters to address advanced engineering process requirements.},

ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system’s topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0–1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.},

The trusted insider is one of the greatest challenges facing organisations today. The analysis considers the balance to be struck between allowing insiders access and privileges to show trust and increase productivity, and securing that access at the cost of good will and with an increased risk of workarounds being found, placing vulnerabilities at the heart of an organisation’s policies and processes. The tactics of social engineering and exploitation of human psychology to compromise or completely bypass technical and procedural security measures are considered, along with the effectiveness of training and difficulties of raising cultural awareness of security on a long term basis in a rapidly changing technological landscape.},

Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resource being protected and be generated dynamically by resources depending on the context in which the resource is being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.},

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.},

However, there is a growing concern among users regarding the security risks associated with CPS. Especially with rising number of cyber-attacks on CPS, such as modifying sensor readings, interrupting operations, etc. Therefore, this paper describes a security surveillance framework to detect deviations in the ecosystem by incorporating a digital twin supported anomaly detection model. The reason for incorporating digital twins is that they add value by enabling real-time monitoring of connected smart farms. We pre-process the collected data from sensors deployed on the smart farm setup. The pre-processed data is fused with our smart farm ontology to populate a knowledge graph. The generated graph is further queried to extract the necessary sensor data. We utilize the extracted normal data to train the anomaly detection model. Further, we tested our model if it identifies abnormal values from sensors by simulating anomalous use case scenarios specific to our ecosystem.},

Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.},

  abstract  = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasingly more complex and integrated into our everyday lives forming the basis of smart infrastructures, products, and services. Consequently, there is a greater need for their ability to perform their required functions under expected and unexpected adverse events. Moreover, the multitude of threats and their rapid evolution pushes the development of approaches that go beyond pure technical reliability, rather encompassing multi-dimensional performance of a socio-technical system. These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.},

  abstract  = {The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.},

  abstract       = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.},

While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.},

More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs. However, efficiently creating, maintaining, and running digital twins still represents a major research challenge, as the overhead costs hinder the adoption of this concept. We believe that these insights are valuable to shape future research in this emerging research area at the intersection of digital twins and information security.},

For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures. Thus, this paper conceptualizes a flexible security analytics service that implements security capabilities with flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs' needs. The security analytics service is also evaluated with a real-world use case.},

Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.},

Digitization, decentralization, and high connectivity, as well as incorporation of various enabling technologies, raise various security issues. These security concerns may affect safety, endangering assets and even human lives. This is especially true for CPS utilization in different sectors of great significance, including manufacturing or critical infrastructures, creating a need for efficiently handling relevant security issues. Including security as part of a software-intensive technical system (i.e., the CPS) that can be distributed and highly resilient highlights the need for appropriate security methodologies to be applied on the CPS from the engineering stage during CPS design. The efficient security-related processes that are implemented at design time have an impact on security monitoring during the CPS operational phase (at run-time). Efficient and accurate security monitoring that follows security-by-design principles can be a potent tool in the hands of the CPS manager for detecting and mitigating cyber threats. Monitoring traffic and activity at the system boundaries, detecting changes to device status and configuration, detecting suspicious activity indicating attacks, detecting unauthorized activity that is suspicious or violates security policies, and timely responding to security incidents and recovering from them are issues that need to be efficiently tackled with by security monitoring. In this chapter, we explore the various CPS cybersecurity threats and discuss how adding security as a parameter at the CPS design phase can provide a well-structured and efficient approach on providing strong security CPS foundations. New technologies on CPS security design are presented and emerging security directions are discussed. Furthermore, in the chapter, the different aspects of security monitoring are presented with a special emphasis on CPSs, discussing the various existing monitoring approaches that are followed in order to detect security issues at run-time. Specific use cases of CPSs in the manufacturing domain and with reference to critical infrastructures are also detailed and security requirements like confidentiality, integrity, and availability are discussed.},

The first-of-a-kind twin collects information about the computer network, associates it with attack tactics, measures the efficiency of implemented security controls requirements and automatically detects missing security controls. The twin also evaluates a cyber risk value using the attack graph and proposes prioritization of the detected requirements to rapidly reduce risk within existing system constraints. The cyber digital twin simulator offers several new risk reduction methods for automatically selecting security controls requirements. The necessary data for constructing a contextual cyber digital twin is defined, including the relationship between security controls and attack tactics. The paper illustrates the calculations used for ranking security controls' risk impact, the algorithm for security controls' requirements prioritization, and finally demonstrates successful results using a field experiment conducted via an active network.},

One of the key enabling technologies of smart living is the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of application including critical national infrastructure (CNI) such as transport, hospitals and power distribution grid. The proliferation in IoT applications raised many serious security and privacy concerns to citizens, businesses and governments. CNI systems depend heavily on IoT devices and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) to perform autonomous actions or inform human decision makers through the exchange and processing of data. Recently, blockchain has been advocated as a solution for secure data storage and sharing. Blockchain cryptographically offers a secure platform for maintaining a decentralised, append-only, publicly verifiable and immutable data structure, which is timestamped and sequentially ordered by its reference to previous block hashes. The immutability and security of blockchain can improve the CNI protection. Two specific smart CNI enabling technologies that would highly benefit from blockchain are IoT and CPS. Digital twins are virtual replica&nbsp;of the&nbsp;network and&nbsp;logic layer of&nbsp;physical system. A digital twin provides a platform to solve major IoT related CNI cybersecurity challenges in tomorrow’s secure infrastructure, energy distribution, smart cities, smart manufacturing (Industrial IoT and Industry4.0) and autonomous transit systems. This key note discussion outlines how to implement blockchain as a fundamental theory for trustless security for connected CNI. It will investigate technologies which can be utilised to achieve a trustless matrix such as blockchain and peer-distributed security systems, for instance onion-routing, with the wider aim of defining trustless security further. The research also considers the feasibility of trustless IoT security systems and their application in CNI. It investigate the present state-of-the-art in cybersecurity as it relates to trustless security technologies and blockchain and what is the present state of the art of cybersecurity in IoT-enabled CNI systems.},

For unknown model parameters, the adaptive system identification is proposed to model closed-loop virtual systems and residual signals with fault-free case data. Performance indices are improved to make the design of robust monitoring and diagnosis system to identify the apparatus status. Soft-sensor, parameterization control, and model-matching reconfiguration are ameliorated and incorporated into the optimized control configuration to guarantee stable and safe control performance under apparatus faults. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed digital twin system are evaluated by using different simulations on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process in the presence of realistic fault scenarios.

The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration. In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence.},

  abstract  = {Smart inverters connected to a communication network are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, a self-security approach is implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. The digital twin is formed using the inverter’s normal operating region and the inverter’s dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates how the inverter’s normal operating region and dynamic model are formed. In particular, the normal operation region is experimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 1.5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter and a 12-kW NHR 9410 regenerative power grid emulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique can potentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks by examining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter’s digital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

We aim to explore whether industrial IoT devices typically serve a common role in cyber-physical systems, and their communications exhibit predictable patterns that can be defined in MUD profile(s) formally and succinctly. We design a framework that utilizes the concept of digital twins and software-defined networking to improve the security of Industrial IoT environments. The MUD data are profiled, and the actions are evaluated on the network digital twin before they are used in the physical network. The behavioral profiling system is updated in real time, thereby improving the overall system security and compliance to policies in the IoT deployment. Evaluation results show that our solution outperforms existing approaches substantially in terms of attack detection accuracy, predicting security incidents, response time, and resource usage.},

The introduction of the digital economy leads to an increase in the risk of cyber threats associated with access control problems between information flow regulation and control systems. To solve the problems of detecting cyber threats, it is proposed to use generative adversarial neural networks. Algorithms for learning and testing a neural network were presented.

However, a wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into connected and integrated networks. This is also the case for CI such as a smart grid. Smart grid security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to provide its users a platform to train and test cyber attacks, in a safe and controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying physical configuration and difficulty to scale. To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on smart grids. On the developed twin, the users can deploy real world attacks and countermeasures, to test and study its effectiveness. The difference from the physical test-bed is that its users may easily modify their power system components and configurations. Further, reproducing the twin for using and advancing the research is significantly cheaper. The developed twin has advanced features compared to any equivalent system in the literature. To illustrate a typical use case, we present a case study where a cyber attack is launched and discuss its implications.},

This paper describes how centralized and decentralized DTs can help to monitor and control future power systems with special consideration of their interaction in case of corrupted communication from cyber-attacks. While the virtual representation of substations is regarded from the edge computing perspective the control room of the interconnected power system represents the centralized perspective. The concepts allows to have a system wide perspective, while also keeping detailed information at hand. The future system operator in the control room will benefit from services provided by DTs analytical and control features, rising resilience to cyber-physical anomalies and enhance situational awareness.},

The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.},

  abstract       = {Featured Application Perimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts. The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are presented along with a discussion of future directions.},

We suggest a set of solutions for trust management that can support the unique security, safety, and privacy requirements of a robust IoT. Prominent among these solutions is the use of an older approach for access control, viz. the reference monitor, and blockchain technologies that can record trust and policy graphs and trust-related attributes for IoT devices and supporting services. An open, but governed trust blockchain can serve as a universal trusted oracle.},

These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge.},

  abstract       = {Malware analysis is fundamental for defending against prevalent cyber security threats, and requires a means to deploy and study behavioural software traits as more sophisticated malware is developed. Traditionally, virtual machines are used to provide an environment that is isolated from production systems so as to not cause any adverse impact on existing infrastructure. Malware developers are fully aware of this and so will often develop evasion techniques to avoid detection within sandbox environments. In this paper, we conduct an investigation into anti-evasion malware triggers for uncovering malware behaviours that may act benign when they detect a traditional sandbox environment. To facilitate our investigation, we developed a dynamic sandbox reconfiguration tool called MORRIGU that couples together both automated and human-driven analysis for anti-evasion configuration testing, along with a visual analytics view for examining system behaviours and performing comparative analysis. Our study reveals a variety of anti-evasion traits that are shared amongst different malware families, such as sandbox `wear-and-tear&amp;rsquo;, and Reverse Turing Tests (RTT), as well as more sophisticated malware samples that require multiple anti-evasion checks to be deployed. Using a systematic testing approach such as MORRIGU enables test coverage of anti-evasion methods, whilst also offering flexibility for further human-driven analysis of additional evasion methods. We also perform a comparative study against automated analysis using Cuckoo sandbox to show that automated scoring alone can not reliably inform on the presence of evasive malware, hence requiring a more sophisticated anti-evasive testing approach. With a greater understanding of anti-evasion malware triggers and with appropriate tools to explore these in an effective and efficient manner, this study helps to advance research on how evasive malware is being utilised to evade analysis so that we can better defend against future attacks.},

This proposition makes IoT Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) cost and management prohibitive. One possible approach is to develop a digital twin of the IoT device and employ many replicas of the twin in a simulation environment comprised of various simulators that mimic the IoT device's operational environment. Cyber attack experimentation is a critical aspect of IoT T&amp;E and without such a virtual T&amp;E environment, it is almost impossible to study large scale effects.

By simulating the nominal behavior of the system online, i.e., in parallel to the process, and continuously comparing the simulated behavior to the measured values allows to detect attacks. Their localization is facilitated through a root-cause analysis, which is also based on the model description of the plant.

In particular, the use of tele-remote systems, as SCADA, allows the collection of data and the control of hydraulic devices. Today, by benefiting from the power of computers and servers, the digital twins of hydrographical networks can be designed. A digital twin aims to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a canal.

In such systems, it is mandatory to monitor the field network and detect potential threats before a problem occurs. This work proposes a hybrid approach that orchestrates unsupervised and incremental learning methods to detect threats that impact the control loops in a plant. We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90% precision and with accuracy higher than 95%.},

  abstract  = {In the era of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, machines and devices are increasingly getting connected. These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices’ known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.},

This paper provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from the different actual power and control entities. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the voltage estimates, with 98.2% accuracy from only the controllers' states.},

The idea is that the real product and its virtual counterpart are twins that travel a parallel journey from design and development to production and service life. The intelligence that comes from DTs’ operational data supports the interactions between the DTs to pave the way for the cyber-physical integration of smart manufacturing. This paper presents a conceptual framework for digital twins collaboration to provide an auto-detection of erratic operational data by utilizing operational data intelligence in the manufacturing systems. The proposed framework provide an interaction mechanism to understand the DT status, interact with other DTs, learn from each other DTs, and share common semantic knowledge. In addition, it can detect the anomalies and understand the overall picture and conditions of the operational environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework is described in the workflow model, which breaks down into four phases: information extraction, change detection, synchronization, and notification. A use case of Energy 4.0 fault diagnosis for wind turbines is described to present the use of the proposed framework and DTs collaboration to identify and diagnose the potential failure, e.g., malfunctioning nodes within the energy industry.},

All these smart applications have also increased the overall attack surface leading to multiple attack vectors available through vulnerabilities. Lack of standards, insufficient security awareness, and new technological landscape does not help either. Considering this, one needs to enhance forensics investigation methodologies, employ novel tools, combine threat intelligence, and integrate forensic readiness. Such measures will help to reduce the total cyber risk through a high level of preparedness for anticipated data-driven crimes in smart applications. We believe that this paper will help in bringing novel focus to existing digital forensics methodologies with a focus on smart applications.},

  abstract  = {The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

  abstract       = {In recent years, the need for Operational Technology (OT) defenses has been recognized, serving as an additional line of defense when Information Technology (IT) defenses are bypassed. This is no longer considered an uncommon possibility when dealing with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors expected to be state-sponsored and receiving insider assistance. In these extreme adversarial situations, OT defenses aim to provide another layer of defense for the system, introduced directly at the physical process level, as described by the sensors data, the system model, and control actions. Just like IT defenses, two schools of thought, i.e., passive and active defenses, have emerged to address this challenge. In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors.},

Attackers use various vulnerabilities of such systems including specific vulnerabilities of AI components. It is important to make sure that inappropriate adversarial content will not break the security walls and will not harm the decision logic of critical systems. We believe that the corresponding security toolset must be organized as a trainable self-protection mechanism similar to immunity. We found certain similarities between digital vs. biological immunity and we study the possibilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to provide the basis for the digital immunity training. We suggest the taxonomy of GANs (including new architectures) suitable to simulate various aspects of the immunity for Industry 4.0 applications.},

Strong reliance of proposed solutions on communication and data management, as well as on a variety of complex and heterogeneous architectures and components exposes a range of vulnerabilities. The weaknesses are strongly correlated to dependability, which is crucial factor for success of AD. IoT4CPS, a flagship Austrian project, contributes to improvements in required dependability. It is developing guidelines, methods and tools for safe and secure integration of IoT into AD and corresponding smart production. The project addresses safety and security aspects of AD in a holistic manner.

The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze the current research activities on CPPSs according to their contributions to the engineering life cycle of such production system. Firstly, a method for SLR is presented. Then, literature analysis of CPPSs is conducted to present research activities in the light of the concept development and engineering development stages. Finally, based on the results of the literature analysis, a concept map of CPPSs research is proposed, which depicts the existing research topics in the engineering life cycle of CPPSs. And we exploit it to propose a research agenda of the CPPSs integration process required to ensure their efficient industrial use.
