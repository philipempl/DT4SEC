However, this makes ICS more connected to communication networks that provide a potential platform for attackers to intrude into the systems and cause damage and catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose implementing digital twins that have been equipped with an intrusion detection algorithm. Our novel algorithm is able to detect attacks in a timely manner and also diagnose the type of attack by classification of different types of attacks. With digital twins, which are a new concept in ICS, we have virtual replicas of physical systems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of the physical systems. So by placing the intrusion detection algorithm in digital twins, security tests can be done remotely without risking negative impacts on live systems.",,Integrated circuits;Support vector machines;Digital twin;Industrial control;Intrusion detection;Software;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Digital twins;Industrial control systems,data/pdfs/Akbarian2020.pdf,

Stand. Mag.,5,1,,40--46,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the new industrial revolution of digital transformation, more intelligence and autonomous systems can be adopted in the manufacturing transportation processes. Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision.

Its outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication, consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and interdependencies between different production assets are commonly ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future.

This chapter overviews the engineering process of C-CPSs, typically long-running technical systems, such as industrial manufacturing systems and continuous processing systems. This chapter also covers major areas of requirements that include: (a) processes with intensive generation of engineering artifacts; (b) challenges regarding dependencies and complexity of engineering artifacts, stemming from variants of a product and the associated production process for a family of products; (c) management of model and consistency rules for dependencies between model parts; (d) the internationalization of the engineering process with partners on different levels of trust; and (e) the security of the engineering processes, such as confidentiality of engineering plans, and the security of the systems to be engineered, such as security aspects in the design phase.

ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system’s topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0–1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.",,,data/pdfs/Bitton2018 - Deriving a Cost Effective Digital Twin of an Ics to Facilitate Security Evaluation.pdf,

New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.",,"building trust, virtual evaluation, smart ecosystems, malicious behavior, automotive",data/pdfs/Cioroaica2019 - (do Not) Trust in Ecosystems.pdf,

Consequently, there is a greater need for their ability to perform their required functions under expected and unexpected adverse events. Moreover, the multitude of threats and their rapid evolution pushes the development of approaches that go beyond pure technical reliability, rather encompassing multi-dimensional performance of a socio-technical system. These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.",,"Safety, Security, Business continuity, Cybersecurity, Socio-technical systems, Cyber resilience",data/pdfs/Colabianchi2021 - Discussing Resilience in the Context of Cyber Physical Systems.pdf,

Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.",,Deep learning;Power measurement;Digital twin;SCADA systems;Power grids;Phasor measurement units;Sensor systems;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Digital Twin;Smart Grid;Cyber Physical System;Wide Area Monitoring System;Anomaly Detection;Fault Detection,data/pdfs/Danilczyk2021 - Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Using a Deep Learning Digital Twin.pdf,

As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems.

These industrial control systems (ICS) mainly focus on operation and availability -- instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the ICS to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel.",,"security-by-design, industrial vulnerabilities, digital twin, system testing",data/pdfs/Dietz2022.pdf,

While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed.

More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs.

As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device.

Digitization, decentralization, and high connectivity, as well as incorporation of various enabling technologies, raise various security issues. These security concerns may affect safety, endangering assets and even human lives. This is especially true for CPS utilization in different sectors of great significance, including manufacturing or critical infrastructures, creating a need for efficiently handling relevant security issues. Including security as part of a software-intensive technical system (i.e., the CPS) that can be distributed and highly resilient highlights the need for appropriate security methodologies to be applied on the CPS from the engineering stage during CPS design. The efficient security-related processes that are implemented at design time have an impact on security monitoring during the CPS operational phase (at run-time). Efficient and accurate security monitoring that follows security-by-design principles can be a potent tool in the hands of the CPS manager for detecting and mitigating cyber threats. Monitoring traffic and activity at the system boundaries, detecting changes to device status and configuration, detecting suspicious activity indicating attacks, detecting unauthorized activity that is suspicious or violates security policies, and timely responding to security incidents and recovering from them are issues that need to be efficiently tackled with by security monitoring. In this chapter, we explore the various CPS cybersecurity threats and discuss how adding security as a parameter at the CPS design phase can provide a well-structured and efficient approach on providing strong security CPS foundations. New technologies on CPS security design are presented and emerging security directions are discussed. Furthermore, in the chapter, the different aspects of security monitoring are presented with a special emphasis on CPSs, discussing the various existing monitoring approaches that are followed in order to detect security issues at run-time.

One of the key enabling technologies of smart living is the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of application including critical national infrastructure (CNI) such as transport, hospitals and power distribution grid. The proliferation in IoT applications raised many serious security and privacy concerns to citizens, businesses and governments. CNI systems depend heavily on IoT devices and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) to perform autonomous actions or inform human decision makers through the exchange and processing of data. Recently, blockchain has been advocated as a solution for secure data storage and sharing. Blockchain cryptographically offers a secure platform for maintaining a decentralised, append-only, publicly verifiable and immutable data structure, which is timestamped and sequentially ordered by its reference to previous block hashes. The immutability and security of blockchain can improve the CNI protection. Two specific smart CNI enabling technologies that would highly benefit from blockchain are IoT and CPS. Digital twins are virtual replica&nbsp;of the&nbsp;network and&nbsp;logic layer of&nbsp;physical system. A digital twin provides a platform to solve major IoT related CNI cybersecurity challenges in tomorrow’s secure infrastructure, energy distribution, smart cities, smart manufacturing (Industrial IoT and Industry4.0) and autonomous transit systems. This key note discussion outlines how to implement blockchain as a fundamental theory for trustless security for connected CNI. It will investigate technologies which can be utilised to achieve a trustless matrix such as blockchain and peer-distributed security systems, for instance onion-routing, with the wider aim of defining trustless security further. The research also considers the feasibility of trustless IoT security systems and their application in CNI.

A significant amount of renewable generation is from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), upon which the system operators often have limited visibility. This can bring significant challenges as the increasing DERs' can lead to network constraints being violated, presenting critical risks for network security. Enhancing the visibility of DERs can be achieved via the provision of communication links, but this can be costly, particularly for real time applications. Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is considered as a promising solution for enhancing the visibility of a physical system, where only a limited set of data is required to be transmitted with the rest data of interest can be estimated via the DT. The development and demonstration of DTs requires realistic testing and validation enviorment in order to accelerate its adoption in the industry. This paper presents a real time simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing platform, specifically designed for prototyping, demonstrating and testing DTs of DERs. Within the proposed platform, a software-based communication emulator is developed, which allows the investigation of the impact of communication latency and jitter on the performance of DTs of the DERs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of the developed DT prototyping process and testing platform to enable frequency control using the DTs, which provide valuable learnings and tools for enabling future DTs-based solutions.",,Digital Twin; Distributed Energy Resources; real-time simulation; hardware-in-the-loop testing,,

The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.",,Robots;Surgery;Real-time systems;Computer security;Task analysis;Reliability;Digital twin;virtual reality;robot control;mobile networks;network security,data/pdfs/Laaki2019 - Prototyping a Digital Twin for Real Time Remote Control Over Mobile Networks_ Application of Remote Surgery.pdf,

Traditionally, virtual machines are used to provide an environment that is isolated from production systems so as to not cause any adverse impact on existing infrastructure. Malware developers are fully aware of this and so will often develop evasion techniques to avoid detection within sandbox environments. In this paper, we conduct an investigation into anti-evasion malware triggers for uncovering malware behaviours that may act benign when they detect a traditional sandbox environment. To facilitate our investigation, we developed a dynamic sandbox reconfiguration tool called MORRIGU that couples together both automated and human-driven analysis for anti-evasion configuration testing, along with a visual analytics view for examining system behaviours and performing comparative analysis. Our study reveals a variety of anti-evasion traits that are shared amongst different malware families, such as sandbox `wear-and-tear&amp;rsquo;, and Reverse Turing Tests (RTT), as well as more sophisticated malware samples that require multiple anti-evasion checks to be deployed. Using a systematic testing approach such as MORRIGU enables test coverage of anti-evasion methods, whilst also offering flexibility for further human-driven analysis of additional evasion methods. We also perform a comparative study against automated analysis using Cuckoo sandbox to show that automated scoring alone can not reliably inform on the presence of evasive malware, hence requiring a more sophisticated anti-evasive testing approach. With a greater understanding of anti-evasion malware triggers and with appropriate tools to explore these in an effective and efficient manner, this study helps to advance research on how evasive malware is being utilised to evade analysis so that we can better defend against future attacks.",,,data/pdfs/Mills2021 - Investigating Anti Evasion Malware Triggers Using Automated Sandbox Reconfiguration Techniques.pdf,

In particular, the use of tele-remote systems, as SCADA, allows the collection of data and the control of hydraulic devices. Today, by benefiting from the power of computers and servers, the digital twins of hydrographical networks can be designed. A digital twin aims to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a canal. It is used to play-back past scenarios allowing feedback of applied management strategies and fast simulations with predictive and adaptive management strategies to determine their performances and giving decision aid criteria for the managers. The objective of the presented paper is to define the framework for a digital twin of the Canal of Calais.",,"Hydrographical networks, Water system, Digital twin, Simulation",data/pdfs/Ranjbar2020 - Framework for a Digital Twin of the Canal of Calais.pdf,

We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90% precision and with accuracy higher than 95%.",,,data/pdfs/Reis2020 - Unsupervised and Incremental Learning Orchestration for Cyber Physical Security.pdf,

These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices’ known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.",,"Multi-mode systems, Mode switching, Resilience, Security, Industry 4.0, Zero-day vulnerabilities",data/pdfs/Riegler2021 - Multi Mode Systems for Resilient Security in Industry 4.0.pdf,

An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research.

This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm.

In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including system testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security testing, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle. However, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system.

With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework through a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through Integrity Checking Mechanisms (ICMs).

This is no longer considered an uncommon possibility when dealing with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors expected to be state-sponsored and receiving insider assistance. In these extreme adversarial situations, OT defenses aim to provide another layer of defense for the system, introduced directly at the physical process level, as described by the sensors data, the system model, and control actions. Just like IT defenses, two schools of thought, i.e., passive and active defenses, have emerged to address this challenge. In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors.",,"Neural network, Deep learning, Cybersecurity, Active monitoring, Reduced-order modeling",data/pdfs/Sundaram2020 - A Data Analytical Approach for Assessing the Efficacy of Operational Technology Active Defenses against Insider Threats.pdf,

The automotive industry is impacted on by several additional trends. One of those is autonomous driving (AD), which needs to be propped up by integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to improve user acceptance. Strong reliance of proposed solutions on communication and data management, as well as on a variety of complex and heterogeneous architectures and components exposes a range of vulnerabilities. The weaknesses are strongly correlated to dependability, which is crucial factor for success of AD. IoT4CPS, a flagship Austrian project, contributes to improvements in required dependability. It is developing guidelines, methods and tools for safe and secure integration of IoT into AD and corresponding smart production. The project addresses safety and security aspects of AD in a holistic manner. Some of the resulting considerations are described in this paper, alongside possible solutions based on virtualisation through usage of digital twins.",,,data/pdfs/Veledar2019 - Digital Twins for Dependability Improvement of Autonomous Driving.pdf,

Journal Article,,Wei2022,"Wei, Yuying; Law, Adrian Wing-Keung; Yang, Chun & Tang, Di",Combined Anomaly Detection Framework for Digital Twins of Water Treatment Facilities,Water,14,7,,1001,2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Digital twins of cyber-physical systems with automated process control systems using programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are increasingly popular nowadays. At the same time, cyber-physical security is also a growing concern with system connectivity. This study develops a combined anomaly detection framework (CADF) against various types of security attacks on the digital twin of process control in water treatment facilities. CADF utilizes the PLC-based whitelist system to detect anomalies that target the actuators and the deep learning approach of natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) and probabilistic assessment to detect anomalies that target the sensors. The effectiveness of CADF is verified using a physical facility for water treatment with membrane processes called the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system in the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Various attack scenarios are tested in SWaT by falsifying the reported values of sensors and actuators in the digital twin process. These scenarios include both trivial attacks, which are commonly studied, as well as non-trivial (i.e., sophisticated) attacks, which are rarely reported. The results show that CADF performs very well with good detection accuracy in all scenarios, and particularly, it is able to detect all sophisticated attacks while ongoing before they can induce damage to the water treatment facility. CADF can be further extended to other cyber-physical systems in the future.",,anomaly detection; digital twin; NGBoost; probabilistic forecasting; programmable logic controller,data/pdfs/Wei2022.pdf,

The application of CPSs in production and manufacturing environments gave rise to the term Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). There is a growing interest in CPPSs, yet research in this area is scattered and needs to be reviewed for understanding their development status and maturity. The aim of this study is to carry out a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze the current research activities on CPPSs according to their contributions to the engineering life cycle of such production system. Firstly, a method for SLR is presented. Then, literature analysis of CPPSs is conducted to present research activities in the light of the concept development and engineering development stages. Finally, based on the results of the literature analysis, a concept map of CPPSs research is proposed, which depicts the existing research topics in the engineering life cycle of CPPSs. And we exploit it to propose a research agenda of the CPPSs integration process required to ensure their efficient industrial use. Findings of this review can help researchers to examine the maturity of the development status of CPPSs, to discover which phases require improvement, and to know the future research directions for their industrial practices.",,,data/pdfs/Wu2020 - Concept and Engineering Development of Cyber Physical Production Systems_ a Systematic Literature Review.pdf,

As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone’s privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permissionbased access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by [1] and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by [2] and achieved a 100 CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.",,Smart homes;Access control;Servers;Emulation;Permission;Computer science;Safety,,

Journal Article,,Zhou2022abcde,"Zhou, Haifeng; Li, Mohan; Sun, Yanbin; Tian, Zhihong & Yun, Lei",Digital Twin based Cyber Range for Industrial Internet of Things,IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine,,,,1--11,2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the continuous integration of information technology and operation technology, Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT) is gradually changing from closed to open. Operators can configure, monitor, or control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber attacks. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework for a digital twin based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.",,Industrial Internet of Things;Digital twins;Production;Security;Data models;Process control;Industries,,
