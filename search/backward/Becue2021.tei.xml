<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This survey paper discusses opportunities and threats of using artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the manufacturing sector with consideration for offensive and defensive uses of such technology. It starts with an introduction of Industry 4.0 concept and an understanding of AI use in this context. Then provides elements of security principles and detection techniques applied to operational technology (OT) which forms the main attack surface of manufacturing systems. As some intrusion detection systems (IDS) already involve some AI-based techniques, we focus on existing machine-learning and data-mining based techniques in use for intrusion detection. This article presents the major strengths and weaknesses of the main techniques in use. We also discuss an assessment of their relevance for application to OT, from the manufacturer point of view. Another part of the paper introduces the essential drivers and principles of Industry 4.0, providing insights on the advent of AI in manufacturing systems as well as an understanding of the new set of challenges it implies. AI-based techniques for production monitoring, optimisation and control are proposed with insights on several application cases. The related technical, operational and security challenges are discussed and an understanding of the impact of such transition on current security practices is then provided in more details. The final part of the report further develops a vision of security challenges for Industry 4.0. It addresses aspects of orchestration of distributed detection techniques, introduces an approach to adversarial/robust AI development and concludes with human-machine behaviour monitoring requirements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The recent cyber attacks on Renault <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eisenstein 2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Saint-Gobain (2017)</ref>, Rosnef and Merck (Offshore Engineering 2017), among others have spotlighted cybersecurity-related threats towards industry, and their unexpected financial and business impacts. In May 2017 one day of production shut-down in Renault factories cost several million euros to the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eisenstein 2017)</ref>. Unlike risks affecting regular Information Technology (IT) systems, attacks targeting operational technology (OT) which supports industrial processes can cause physical damages and casualties <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lightman et al. 2015)</ref>. When it comes to the manufacturing sector, business impacts add up to safety risks and confidentiality loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lightman et al. 2015)</ref>. The damage can only grow bigger with ultra-digitized plants as envisaged in the vision of Industry 4.0, a concept originally defined by an eponym German governmental project as: "fostering strong customization of products under the conditions of highly flexible production, introduction of methods of self-optimization, self-configuration, self-diagnosis, cognition and intelligent support of workers in their increasingly complex work." <ref type="bibr">(European commission 2017)</ref>. The term as accepted today embraces more broadly the technological, organizational, economical and societal changes driven by enhanced digitization of manufacturing industry.</p><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Russell and Norvig 2009)</ref> is undoubtedly central in the factory of the future (FoF) as promoted by Industry 4.0 vision and reflected in the Strategic Multi-Annual Roadmap for Factories of The Future (Factories of the Future PPP 2020). In particular because the FoF is highly connected and thus generates tremendous amounts of exploitable data which AI techniques suitably ingest. Machine learning (ML) in particular is heavily involved in autonomous and collaborative robotics which will populate the shop floor of the FoF (Factories of the Future PPP 2020). ML definition is commonly attributed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Samuel (1959)</ref> as "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed". Machine learning algorithms construct decision models by generalizing from training data. The literature identifies few learning modes. In supervised ML techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Russell and Norvig 2009)</ref>, the training data set will be completely labeled based on expert knowledge and the algorithm will find a function or model that explains the data. Unsupervised approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hinton and Sejnowski 1999)</ref> consist in finding patterns, structures, or knowledge in unlabeled data. Semi-supervised approaches consist in labeling a portion of the data based on expert knowledge during acquisition phase. Data mining (DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Robert and Trevor 2009)</ref> is the specific step in knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process where a specific algorithm is used to extract patterns from data. To distinguish, ML focuses on classification and prediction based on known properties previously learned from training data and needs a predefined goal. DM focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data. It does not need a specific initial goal. This article however accepts there is a significant overlap between them and uses those term indifferently under the label ML/DM methods.</p><p>In the context of this article, the role of AI can be considered from various perspectives: a strong optimization trigger from the point of view of the manufacturer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cohen 1989)</ref>, a new attack vector or an additional toolkit item for the cyber-offender <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Szychter et al. 2018)</ref>, a new point of vulnerability or a new asset for detection from the point of view of the cyber-defender <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Yampolskiy and Spellchecker 2016)</ref>. DM techniques support fault prediction and advanced process control applications. ML is involved in existing OT intrusion detection systems (OT IDS) and will most likely also support the next generation of attack toolkits. In this report we will provide insights on AI both as a new industrial asset and as a decisive advantage in the confrontation between cyber-offenders and cyber-defenders. Section 2 provides an outlook on Industry 4.0 concept and the specific role of AI in this context. In Section 3 we introduce state of the art OT security tools and techniques. In Sect. 4 we examine the challenges related with the AI in Industry 4.0. Finally, Sect. 5 presents our conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Novelty of Industry 4.0 and involvement of AI in manufacturing</head><p>Industry 4.0 transformation relies on a set of key technologies which apply throughout the industrial value chain from the physical shop floor level up to virtual and informational levels. Additive manufacturing techniques provide enhanced production flexibility and ability to manufacture highly customized goods <ref type="bibr">(Moon et al. 2018)</ref>. Autonomous and collaborative robotics enhance the ability of machines to make their own decisions or learn from human operators without prior specific programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zaataria et al. 2019)</ref>. Industrial internet of things (IIoT) empowers shop floor devices, machines and sensors, enabling continuous data collection and dynamic reconfiguration <ref type="bibr">(Laura et al. 2019)</ref>. Big data analytics support the processing of those massive heterogeneous data and analysis for improved production monitoring, optimization and control <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lu and Xu 2019)</ref>. Real-time decision making based on the huge amounts of data coming from IIoT needs a suitable hardware that provides large storage and high performance computing. In memory-centric architectures the most important or most recent data resides both in-memory and on-disk to increase performance, while low demand or low value data resides only on disk <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Grapentin et al. 2017)</ref>. With this strategy memory centric architectures are able to provide high performance at low cost infrastructures. The open source technology Apache Spark <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Zaharia et al. 2016</ref>) is one of the most popular available today, providing fault-tolerant computation, and support for data processing and analytics, including machine learning and stream processing. Cloud Manufacturing techniques support dynamic deployment of data services throughout the supply chain at minimal marginal cost and optimal allocation of resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Xu 2012)</ref>. Augmented and virtual reality technologies provide intuitive, immersive and enriched interfaces for enhanced human machine interaction and situational awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Choi et al. 2015)</ref>. In this section we will focus on a particular aspect of the transformation which is the advent of artificial intelligence into the FoF. We will identify new usecases which AI enables and evaluate the impact on security considerations for future industry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">The advent of AI in industrial automation</head><p>Industrial AI can be broadly defined as any application of AI relating to the physical operations or systems of an enterprise. Industrial AI is focused on helping an enterprise monitor, optimize or control the behavior of these operations and systems to improve their efficiency and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lee et al. 2018)</ref>. Industrial AI includes, for example, applications relating to the manufacturing of physical products, to supply chains and warehouses where physical items are stored and moved, to the operation of building HVAC systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Culp et al. 1990)</ref>, to shop floor asset management and maintenance, just to give some examples. A framework for thinking about different types of industrial AI scenarios is helpful in identifying the areas of a business in which to apply it. We can categorize industrial AI applications as monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Li et al. 2017)</ref>, optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Xue et al. 2001)</ref>, or control <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Wang 2019</ref>) based on the degree of automation that they seek to provide. In this section, we explore these categories and present representative use cases for each. The list of use cases provided herein is not intended to be exhaustive; rather they are presented to illustrate a few of the many opportunities available to apply industrial AI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">AI-based process monitoring</head><p>In industrial scenarios, there is a continual need to monitor the performance of systems and processes to identify or predict faults or other situations likely to produce undesirable results <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ji and Wang 2017)</ref>. Using machine learning, models can be trained on available data to learn the internal, opaque state of complex systems. These models can then be queried to predict those system's future state, given a set of input data. Here are many examples of monitoring applications that benefit from an AI-based approach.</p><p>Quality control: a common manufacturing use case for AI is for machines to visually inspect items on a production line. Using AI allows quality control to be automated, and ensures that all final product is inspected, allowing fewer defects to reach customers compared to traditional statistical sampling method <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Park et al. 2019</ref>). In addition to ensuring that products are free of imperfections, AI-based visual inspection systems can validate many product attributes including geometry and tolerances, surface finish, product classification, packaging, color and texture.</p><p>Fault detection and isolation: in regulated manufacturing environments, ensuring process compliance can be expensive and time consuming. In many such scenarios, lives are at stake-as can be the case in the food, chemical and energy industries. By monitoring a variety of system operational factors, AI can be used in the detection, prediction and diagnosis of undesirable operating conditions in industrial systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fuente and Saludes 2000)</ref>. By accelerating or replacing unreliable and time-consuming human analysis, automated process surveillance helps prevent or minimize system downtime and the persistence of hazardous conditions.</p><p>Predictive maintenance: is a rapidly growing subset of fault detection and isolation, focused on predicting the failure of deployed systems before they result in downtime. Aircraft engines provide an often cited example Thapar (2019): GE's GEnx engine is embedded with 5000 sensors producing 5-10 TB of performance, health and efficiency data each day of flight. This data allows GE systems to predict failures before they happen and proactively schedule repairs and order replacement parts. In general, AI use for predictive maintenance is very widespread in aviation domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Korvesis 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Inventory monitoring. AI powers a wide variety of inventory management and supply chain use cases, allowing enterprises to avoid costly stock-outs. Hardware retailer Lowe's presented the LoweBot <ref type="bibr">(Lowe's Company Incorporated 2016)</ref>, an autonomous mobile robot operating in stores in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition to its customer service tasks, the LoweBot uses an on-board computer vision system to detect misplaced and out-of-stock inventory on store shelves. Similar systems are being deployed in warehouses, with several startups experimenting with drone-based approaches.</p><p>Supply chain risk management: effective management of a complex, global supply chain demands the ability to identify and mitigate potential disruptions before they cause delays or shortages <ref type="bibr">(Baryannis et al. 2018)</ref>. AI can be used to predict supply disturbances before they happen, providing early warning for enter-prise supply chains based on potential disruptors sourced from global news, event and weather feeds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">AI-based process optimization</head><p>AI-based planning and decision support systems go a step beyond monitoring and allow users to determine a path, or plan, for getting to a desired system state in a way that 1 3 optimizes a target set of business metrics. Note that in classical academic artificial intelligence circles, "planning" refers to a specific category of problem, often formulated with unrealistic constraints, such as offline agents operating in static, deterministic environments. Here we use the term in the broader business sense. Optimization activities that can benefit from the application of ML &amp; AI include: process planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Xue et al. 2001</ref>): many industrial scenarios involve complex sequences of work whose ordering can significantly impact factors such as cost, time, quality, labor input, materials input, tool life and waste. A simple and well-studied example is the sequence of operations required to create a machined part or die using computer numeric control (CNC) machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gacek 2012)</ref>. A given part is made up of a sequence of operations such as cuts. Each cut is made using a specific tool, of which there are many, but only a few can be loaded on the machine at the same time. A variety of different optimization problems arise from this scenario, including set-up planning, operation selection and sequencing, machine and tool selection, and tool path sequencing. Each of these has been solved with a variety of machine learning techniques including genetic algorithms and neural networks.</p><p>Job shop scheduling: a specific type of process planning problem, models the allocation of jobs of varying processing times to a set of machines with varying processing power. Job shop scheduling provides a well-studied, if idealized, model for many common industrial scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Çaliş and Bulkan 2013)</ref>. Many different types of problems can be modeled using the general job shop scheduling approach and AI, including the famous "traveling salesperson problem," which seeks to optimize the routing of a salesperson traveling to a list of cities given the distances between each city pair. These problems have been historically solved using operations research methods such as combinatorial optimization, but lend themselves to learning approaches that can more easily adapt to changes in their environment. Yield management: in manufacturing, the yield of a given processes can mean the difference between profitable and unprofitable products <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Shin and Park 2010)</ref>. For example, in semiconductor manufacturing, in the face of increasingly complex manufacturing processes, with many hundreds of process parameters coming into play in the production of a single wafer, traditional techniques for estimating and optimizing yields have become untenable. Machine learning allows manufacturers to fully utilize avail-able data to continually improve process quality and increase yields. Anticipatory logistics and supply chain management: supply chain management is traditionally a two-step process. First statistical tools are used to produce a demand forecast. The forecast is then used as input to an optimization process that evaluates the cost of stock-outs against the delivery times, holding costs and other factors associated with the supply chain. Supply chain managers can then use tools to produce a plan for what to order and when. Using machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Makkar et al. 2020)</ref>, it is now possible to implement a single-step process that learns the relationship between all available input data, including traditional supply chain data such as inventory levels, product orders, and competitive data, as well as external data like weather, social media signals and more, to produce better operational performance. Product design: as digital and physical products grow in complexity, AI can be applied to accelerate the design process and facilitate product engineering and manufacture. With generative design, designers can specify a product by its constraints, and allow a machine learning algorithm to produce design alternatives that optimize qualities such as weight or performance. Airbus and Auto-desk have used this process to create an airplane cabin partition whose design mimics cellular and skeletal structure and is 45% lighter and stronger than current designs <ref type="bibr">(Autodesk 2015)</ref>. Machine learning can also be used to supplement the intuition of product designers to ensure that designed products are actually manufacturable (Balu et al. 2016), and can be used in conjunction with product testing data to identify product deficiencies and suggest alternative designs. Facilities location: machine learning systems can be used to direct the placement of a wide variety of physical facilities within an environment. At the microscopic level, this includes the placement of circuits and components within a semiconductor such as an FPGA <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grewal et al. 2017)</ref>, but it also includes the placement of roads and power substations within residential areas, the location of conference rooms and other facilities within an office building <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Phelan 2016)</ref>, and the positioning of wireless and other sensors within a factory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">AI-based process control</head><p>Control systems ultimately form the heart of any modern industrial operation, and are required by organizations that seek to reap the full benefits of automation. Within the realm of control, there are many examples of applications that benefit from artificial intelligence and machine learning. These include:</p><p>-Robotics: robots are used in a wide variety of industrial scenarios, for diverse applications such as pick and place, sorting, assembly, painting, welding, storage and retrieval, Machine tending, in which robots load or operate other machines such as CNC, is another popular application. Traditionally, robots are explicitly programmed by directing them to move through series of points in two or three dimensional space and perform specific actions at these points. Newer approaches, such as collaborative robots ("co-robots") <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zaataria et al. 2019)</ref>, simplify programming by allowing these points to be captured by physically positioning the robot. The problem with both approaches is that, independent of how the points are captured, the robot is intolerant to changes in the environment or variations in the position of the items it is manipulating. AI, coupled with computer vision technologies, allows robots to avoid potential interference by humans or other robots and to accommodate randomly positioned or mispositioned items without operator intervention. -Autonomous vehicles: autonomous mobile robots are deployed in large number in warehouses and factories, to support material transport and pick-and-pack applications <ref type="bibr">(Bechtsis et al. 2018</ref>). In addition, autonomous robots and flying-drones are being put into service to support inventory management applications in warehouses. Artificial intelligence coupled with computer vision techniques allows autonomous robots to complete these tasks more effectively, to better understand, map and navigate their environments, and to be used more safely around humans. -Factory automation: Industry 4.0, smart factories, and lights-out manufacturing all refer to a vision of the plant or warehouse that is data-driven, intelligent and highly automated. This vision relies heavily on robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(Zaataria et al. 2019</ref>) and autonomous vehicles <ref type="bibr">(Bechtsis et al. 2018)</ref> to move materials and assemble goods, on AI-based computer vision to detect faults and defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Czimmermann et al. 2020)</ref>, and on smart systems to coordinate and optimize the flow of work around the factory. -HVAC automation: in addition to being costly to operate, HVAC systems are often poorly behaved, noisy, and unpredictable under real-world circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Donlon et al. 2016)</ref>. This is especially true as equipment ages and older equipment is replaced, sometimes with units that are mismatched or out of spec with the original system design. In these situations, control strategies derived by HVAC engineers assuming ideal conditions fail to operate in an optimal manner. Machine learning can help building owners maximize comfort, reduce energy costs, eliminate system faults, and extend the life of 1 3</p><p>HVAC equipment. Google has successfully used an AI system based on neural networks to control about 120 data center variables, such as fans, cooling systems, and windows, resulting in a 40% cut in electricity used for cooling and a 15% reduction in overall data center power consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gau and Evans 2016</ref>). -Smart grids: smart grids enhance traditional power distribution systems with data and connectivity to and from devices like smart meters, storage and charging systems, and distributed generation infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Santofimia-Romero et al. 2011)</ref>. AI allows the smart grid to predict demand and faults in the power network, and promptly respond to changing conditions, improving power quality and consistency. Monitoring, Optimization and Control as an AI Maturity Model Monitoring, optimization and control are related in that each successive degree of automation depends on, or assumes, the previous. In addition, each requires increasing degrees of trust on the part of the user.</p><p>As a result, these three often form a progression, or maturity model, with companies first deploying monitoring systems to help them understand the current state of their operations and predict faults; then, as trust grows, they employ AI-based planning and decision support systems to tell them what to do given a current state of the world; finally, and with the requisite controls in place, they allow AI-based control systems to automatically take the actions needed to achieve a desired end-state through robotics or other technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">State of the art OT security tools and techniques</head><p>In this section we will give an overview on some existing security tools and techniques applying to industrial environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fundamentals of OT security</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Background OT Security principles</head><p>A characteristic of most existing manufacturing systems is that they mix assets of very different life cycles. Typically the hard machinery could be running for 30 years in a very steady, frozen con-figuration while newer assets, freshly deployed, operate in highly dynamic and connected mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Stouffer et al. 2015)</ref>. Industrial control systems (ICS) compose the neural system of a factory, connecting sensors and sensing, connecting actuators and actuating this digital manufacturing body. Risk analyses on manufacturing ICS usually reveal several documented or non-documented permanent or intermittent connections to the Internet (ANSSI ICS Working Group 2014). De facto, the Industry 3.0 factory is already connected, and this, most often against good practices of network segregation which should apply. As ICS technology was not initially designed to operate in a connected environment, the protocols in use tend to be natively very vulnerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Stouffer et al. 2015)</ref>. Most often, neither authentication nor encryption is implemented. Industrial processes require time-critical communication which does not easily support the processing overhead of traditional encryption standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Stouffer et al. 2015)</ref>. The first (although obsolete) principle for ICS security is thus physical protection of key assets from unauthorized access. For traditional manufacturing shop floors, the security level of critical ICS is just as good as that of the physical access control and related building management system (BMS) which in many cases is highly vulnerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Granzer et al. 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Network segregation and filtering technology such as firewalls and security gateways also have to adapt to the specific constraints of OT environments with so-called fail-open mechanisms designed to prioritize availability against confidentiality whenever those requirements collide <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Knowles et al. 2015)</ref>. This focus on availability justifies that current ICS have very high safety requirements and a mature management of related risks. They would normally implement strict architecture standards such as the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Williams 1994</ref>) model which prevent contamination of the low level shop floor automation typically supporting safety-critical processes through higher level enterprise IT dedicated to resource planning and logistics. The PERA model still stands as reference for good practices in ICS security architecture, although the late developments of internet born technology such as Industrial IoT (IIoT) and the trend towards cloud based industrial applications known as Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) tend to shuffle the rules and fundamentals of this architectural approach. Novel reference architectures have been proposed by the Industrial IoT Consortium (IIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Lin et al. 2019</ref>) and the Industrial Data Space Consortium <ref type="bibr">(Otto et al. 2019)</ref>. It is acknowledged that the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI) (Deutsches Institut für Normung eV 2016) includes limited considerations for security (System architectures 2019).</p><p>Most critical OT systems typically implement Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS), which are engineered to perform "specific control functions" to fail-safe or maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur <ref type="bibr">(Śliwiński et al. 2018)</ref>. They are composed of sensors, logic solvers, actuators and other control equipment. They would not likely enable to detect cyber-threats but would surely raise alerts whenever such a threat would start to cause physical damages. This of course, only works if the threat does not successfully compromise the SIS itself. For this reason SIS are designed to be independent from all other control systems such as Basic Process Control Systems (BPCS) or Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition systems (SCADA). Still SIS themselves rely on certain elements of software which may need to be patched and updated to remain in security conditions over time. Hence the need for adapted and quite expensive procedures to deploy soft-ware updates on factories and an extreme caution to potential needs of system re-qualification for safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Malatras et al. 2019)</ref>. In synthesis, even the most sensitive parts of a manufacturing system may not live in total and permanent isolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Role and characteristics of state of the art OT IDS</head><p>The above conditions strongly reinforce the need for adapted intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect known and new attacks. IDS will as much as possible operate in a passive way to prevent impact on industrial processes. Most state of the art OT IDS technologies operate at network level and are known as Network IDS (NIDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Malatras et al. 2019)</ref>. For certain types of attacks, typically involving insiders or physical access to industrial assets, a complementary detection capability operating on the end-point might be needed. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Tedeschi et al. 2019</ref>) are resident software monitoring system processes and user behavior against established security policies. Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) might be resident or deployed in a more stealthy way to collect evidence of attacks or perform detection routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Malatras et al. 2019)</ref>. At state of the art, both technologies have noticeable impact on power and processing speed of the host, which may collide with OT requirements.</p><p>IDS can typically use 2 types of detection approaches known as misuse detection (MD) and anomaly detection (AD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>. Misuse Detection is understood as signature-based techniques designed to detect known attacks. A signature is a pattern that corresponds to a known threat. Signature-based detection is the process of comparing signatures against observed events to identify possible incidents. Misuse Detection techniques would typically generate low false-alarm rates but will fail to identify new threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>. A comparison of several MD techniques applied in OT IDS is provided in Sect. 3.3. Anomaly Detection is the process of comparing definitions of what activity is considered Normal against observed events to identify significant deviations. Anomaly Detection techniques rely on modeling the normal network and system behavior, and identifying anomalies as deviations from normal behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>. They would likely generate higher false alarm rates but could effectively detect new (0-day) attacks. A comparison of several state of the art AD techniques is provided in Sect. 3.4. It is important to highlight that MD and AD have complementary strengths and weaknesses which can be combined to benefit from advantages of both. Combined approaches are known as hybrid detection (HD) techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Both MD and AD approaches can rely on a variable mix of expert knowledge and artificial intelligence (AI). Security professionals tend to be cautious with AI-based techniques such as machine learning (ML), in particular if non-supervised ML is used <ref type="bibr">(Śliwiński et al. 2018)</ref>. When it comes to OT environments, where system availability is of paramount importance, a particular care for the avoidance of false positives (FP) applies. While AI based techniques most likely perform in scaling up faster than expert rule-based techniques, they also tend to provide less explicable results (Adadi and Berrada 2018). Also the rules applying to detect malicious attempts on ICS strongly differ from those applying to regular IT systems. While attacks on IT usually perform through unauthorized payloads and/or illegitimate traffic which are easily detectable, attacks on ICS would potentially run authorized software and normal traffic, just altering process times or parameters to cause dysfunction of the industrial process <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Humayed et al. 2017)</ref>. For example, filling a tank at time t and heating it at time t + 1 are two normal control command orders but inverting the sequence causes explosion. Legacy OT systems do not generate tremendous amounts of heterogeneous data that would require highly automated and scalable detection techniques. They are rather predictable in their behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Sun et al. 2016)</ref>, and thus, would effectively be monitored with expert rule based anomaly detection techniques. The rules are highly specific to the considered manufacturing process which raises both the needed skills of attackers and defenders. While caution is used with regards to unsupervised machinelearning for the aforementioned reasons, there is still a very high potential for application ML based anomaly detection because of the predictable nature of legacy ICS behavior. Therefore, many OT IDS products use hybrid techniques (MD &amp; AD) and semi-supervised ML approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">ML applications for Cybersecurity</head><p>Most state of the art applications of AI in field of cybersecurity belong to the field of machine learning (ML), a subfield of AI defined by Arthur Samuel as field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Samuel 1959)</ref>. ML techniques can be grouped into three main types of approaches:-unsupervised approaches consist in finding patterns, structures, or knowledge in unlabeled data;-semisupervised approaches consist in labeling a portion of the data based on expert knowledge during the acquisition phase;-supervised approaches consist in completely labeling the data set based on expert knowledge and finding a function or model that explains the data. Supervised and semi-supervised techniques tend to be preferred by security professionals as they provide more explicable results. Unsupervised techniques tend to be less used in security applications due to the relative aversion of security professionals towards discovery techniques that would not be easily explainable and auditable (Adadi and Berrada 2018). Security relates with responsibility which eventually relies on humans from a legal point of view. Also there is a remaining skepticism that ML would potentially be successful in identifying 0-day attacks, given the fact that ML is trained on historical data and thus may not effectively determine if some incongruity found in operation relates with a new attack or a yet unobserved legitimate data pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>. The malicious nature of a set of events is very dependent on context and target-related information and most likely requires human threat intelligence to make good diagnosis. However, all three techniques have been used with variable success to cybersecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Li 2018)</ref>. Some examples are: threat intelligence, vulnerability discovery, intrusion detection, malware analysis, human bevahiour monitoring and alert enrichment.</p></div>

Legacy OT are predictable and stable and thus would quite well accept ML-based anomaly-detection approaches. It might not remain the case with future IoT oriented factory environments, which will set a challenge for ML application (see Sect. 4). Essentially, two approaches for intrusion detection have need implemented in OT environments:-misuse detection (MD) consists in checking the testing data against signatures corresponding to misuse classes and classify the remaining as normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>;-anomaly detection (AD) consists in testing data against normal traffic pattern defined in the learning phase and classify the remaining as Anomaly <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>. Misuse detection and anomaly detection may involve ML algorithm although with unequal success, depending on the specific technique chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Buczak and Guven 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Requirements applying to OT IDS</head><p>Beyond the traditional detection metrics, three factors need to be taken into account when considering the applicability of a particular IDS technology to OT security: time complexity, incremental update capability, and generalization capacity. Time complexity is a key criterion for IDS aiming at online application, which will most usually be the case in application to OT security monitoring. A rule of thumb tells for n instances, O(n) and O(n log n) algorithms are considered to be linear time, while O(n2) is considered as acceptable time applicable online and O(n3) or above are considered to be much slower algorithms applicable off-line. Processing online and streaming data is a challenge. A method should be close to roughly O(n log n) to be considered a streaming algorithm. Other methods may only be applied with appropriate input data windowing and a small number of instances. Incremental update capability is of paramount importance when it comes to monitor highly dynamic environments. The intentional nature of cybersecurity threats cause many traditional classification approaches to fail. This has been a limitation for the development of ML techniques in the field of security for many years. When rule-based detection is applied, adapted interfaces need to be designed for rule edition by subject matter experts or rule extraction from ML modules per-forming continuous training on live representative data. Generalization capacity also applies with a particular care for the specific nature of OT security problems when compared to IT. The stealthiest threats will target a particular process and cause actions which could be benign on system X but dangerous on system Y.</p><p>Here, an advantage of ML-based techniques is that they can be trained in live operation, taking consideration of the the industrial process and related risks specific to the considered manufacturing environment. A noticeable limitation is that they would not likely capitalize and mutualize the knowledge acquired to enrich a common knowledge base, usable across industries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Misuse detection techniques</head><p>This chapter introduces the different techniques and IDS that support misuse-based intrusion detection, including pattern matching, rule-based techniques, state-based techniques, and data-mining techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Pattern matching</head><p>Most of intrusion detection systems employ a pattern-matching algorithm in order to find the suspicious packets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kumar and Spafford 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dharmapurikar and Lockwood 2006)</ref>. The algorithm checks the presence of a signature in the incoming packet sequence and outputs the location of the string within the packet. The algorithm must be fast enough to detect the malicious behavior, and it must be scalable in order to meet the increase in both the number of signatures and the link speed. String matching algorithms can be categorized into single and multiple pattern matching algorithms. In the single pattern matching, one pattern is matched against the entire text at a time. In contrast, the multiple pattern matching approach compares the text sequence against all signatures all at once. Obviously, the multiple matching approach is a better choice for intrusion detection to avoid sweeping the packet many times. Nevertheless, it consumes more memory and requires a pre-processing phase to program the patterns before the matching phase can start <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Roesch 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Rule-based techniques</head><p>Rule-based systems (also known as expert systems) are one of the earliest misuse-based detection systems. These systems encode intrusive scenarios as a set of rules, which are derived from human experts' knowledge, that dictates what to do or what to conclude in different situations. Therefore, any deviation in the rule matching process is reported as an intrusion. The following is a review of the significant developments in rule-based intrusion detection which have been made in the past several years.</p><p>The intrusion detection expert system (IDES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lunt and Jagannathan 1988)</ref> is the result of research that started in the Computer Science Laboratory at SRI International in the early 1980s. IDES provides a system-independent mechanism for real-time detection of security violations, whether these latter are initiated by outsiders who attempt to break into a system or by insiders who attempt to misuse their privileges. IDES is based on an expert rule-based system which characterizes certain types of intrusions and raises an alarm if observed activity matches any of its encoded intrusion scenarios. The rule-based component was based on the Production-Based Expert System Toolset (P BEST). This component contains rules that describe suspicious behaviour based on knowledge of past intrusions, known system vulnerabilities, or the installation-specific security policy. The rules describe suspicious behaviour that is independent of whether a user is deviating from past behaviour patterns.</p><p>The state transition analysis technique (STAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ilgun et al. 1995)</ref> was conceived as a misuse based detection technique to describe computer penetrations as sequences of actions that an attacker performs to compromise the security of a computer system. STAT uses state transition diagrams to represent attacks as a sequence of actions that leads from one initial starting state just prior to the execution of the attack to at least one target compromised ending state on a system. A state represents a snapshot of the system's securityrelevant properties and resources, and a transition represents the signature actions that if omitted from the execution of an attack scenario would prevent the attack from completing successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Data mining-based techniques</head><p>Data mining has become a very useful technique to reduce information overload and improve decision making by extracting and refining useful knowledge through a process of searching for relation-ships and patterns from the extensive data collected by organizations.</p><p>Recently, data mining techniques have been applied for building misuse detection models, in which intrusion detection is considered as a data analysis process to automatically discover and model features of user's normal or intrusive behaviors. In this area, three types of algorithms are particularly useful for mining audit data, namely classification, link analysis and sequence analysis.</p><p>-Classification algorithms: generate classifiers by learning based on a sufficient amount of normal or abnormal audit data. New audit data are labeled as either normal or abnormal according to the classifier. -Link analysis: determines the relation between fields in the audit database records and normal pro-files are usually derived from these relations. -Sequence analysis: is used to find sequential patterns in audit data and embed these patterns into intrusion detection models.</p><p>Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection (MADA MID) (Lee and Stolfo 2020) is a framework that uses data mining algorithms to compute activity patterns from system audit data and extracts predictive features from these patterns. Precisely, this framework applies data mining programs to audit data to compute frequent patterns, extracts features, and then uses classification algorithms to compute detection models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.4">Ensemble learning</head><p>When training machine learning models the search for performance improvement was always a constant worry of researchers and engineers alike. Polikar defines ensemble learning as: "the process by which multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem.</p><p>Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the performance of a model or reduce the likelihood of an unfortunate selection of a poor one." <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Polikar 2009)</ref>. When it comes to the selection of models there are two types of ensembles, homogeneous ensembles where base learners are usually of the same kind with changes in hyperparameters to increase diversity, and heterogeneous models where different algorithms are merged together to form a stronger model <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(Zhou 2012</ref>). The bagging algorithm, first proposed by <ref type="bibr">Breiman (1996)</ref>, is one of the first ensemble methods, and since then became a staple in the industry, with application in algorithms that stand as the base of highly performant models such as Random Forests (Breiman 2001). Bagging or Bootstrap Aggregation is a technique that given a sample data creates various subsets of the data and trains a weak learner on that subset. After all the weak learners are trained, bagging aggregates all the predictions to form the most efficient predictor.</p><p>Resende and Drummond (2018) ACM Survey from 2018, we can find a references to 35 works using Random Forest for Intrusion Detection, both for misuse and anomaly detection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Zhang and Zulkernine (2005)</ref> proposed the first well-known Random Forest based method applied on intrusion detection. Basically, the approach is a classifier which requires being trained on a labelled dataset compounded of normal and attack flows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Yin et al. (2013)</ref> proposed an intrusion detection method based on the use of two random forest models for classification. The first model is trained using all the available data, both benign and malign (multiple classes) and the second model is trained using only malign data. The models are then employed in parallel, using the first model for an initial evaluation where uncertain classifications are redirected to the next model for a second evaluation. Another work done by <ref type="bibr">Bilge et al. (2012)</ref> proposed the use of random Random Forests to analyze large scale NetFlow data in order to identify botnet servers. The algorithm is used as a first filter and is followed by cross-examination of IP white-lists and black-lists to further reduce false positives. The authors tested the solution with data coming from 2 different networks totaling more than a billion flows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Zhang and Wang (2009)</ref> proposed the use of Hadoop and Mahout (software) and a Random Forest model as a classifier to detect intrusions on websites. The authors tested the method using the KDD99 dataset and with data generated by a non-specified IDS. Both datasets were used for training and testing. Stefanova and Ramachandran (2017) proposed a two-stage classifier for network intrusion detection. The first stage classifies the traffic into the classes "normal" and "attack." The attack traffic is then submitted to a second stage, which classifies into attack types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Domb et al. (2016)</ref> propose a lightweight IoT rules generation and execution framework supported by Random Forest classifiers.</p><p>Boosting is another ensemble technique to create a collection of predictors (weak learners). Boosting utilizes the weight average of each model to make weak learners into strong learners. Unlike bagging where all models run independently, in boosting at each iteration, the current model dictates what features to focus on the next model. This means some samples will appear more often than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Russell and Norvig 2009)</ref>. Adaboost or adaptive boost was first proposed by Freund and Schapire in 1995, with the promise to outperform most of the existing boosting algorithms. One of its most fundamental ideas is that of a weak learner. Weak learners, as opposed to strong learners, are algorithms that perform only slightly better than random guessing, with the advantage of increased computational speed and reduced bias with the resulting reduced tendency to overfit the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Freund and Schapire 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Adaboost has been employed in various situations but it is most commonly used in misuse or signature detection because of its supervised nature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hu et al. (2008)</ref> proposed an AdaBoost-based algorithm, similar to the standard implementation of AdaBoost but, with changes claimed to improve performance in intrusion detection situations. With the usage of the KDD'99 dataset, the proposed solution was able to obtain good results in the chosen metrics, FPR (false positive rate) and detection rate with 0.31-1.79% and 90.04-90.88% respectively. Another intrusion detection solution was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mazini et al. (2018)</ref>, in this case the authors proposed a hybrid solution where the ABC [artificial bee colony (ABC)] algorithm is used to optimize the search for the best feature space (feature selection) and Adaboost.M2 is used in a multiclass classification setting since classic AdaBoost can only do binary classification. In order to validate their results, the authors opted for the usage of FPR, detection rate and accuracy on the NSL-KDD and ISCXIDS2012 datasets. In final analysis, it was found that the proposed solution outperformed other methods with 99.61% detection rate, 0.01 FPR, and 98.90% accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Anomaly detection techniques</head><p>The signature-based approach was the first approach used in IDS, and is always widely used today. It requires expert knowledge to design and set the detection policy (i.e. detection rules). The main issue with this approach is the inability to detect new attack patterns since no rule would match. That is why anomaly-based approaches were designed to minimize this drawback. This chapter covers the different techniques and IDS that supports anomaly-based intrusion detection, including rule-based techniques, biology-based techniques, and machine learning-based techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Rule-based techniques</head><p>The multics intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Sebring et al. 1988</ref>) is a rule-based intrusion detection system, which has been developed by the National Computer Security Centre (NCSC), in co-operation with the Computer Science Laboratory, SRI International, to detect intrusions for the NCSC Dockmaster. MIDAS was one of the first intrusion detection systems that monitored an operational system connected to the Internet. It applies the Production Based Expert System Toolset (P-BEST) for intrusion detection. The P-BEST compiler produces primary LISP functions that incorporate semantics rule. Essentially, The P-BEST rule-base includes two layers; the first layer handles the im-mediate deduction about certain types of events such as "number of failed login attempts" and asserts a fact to the effect that some threshold of suspicion has been reached. Then, the second layer processes these suspicions and decides whether to actually raise an alarm based on the first layer's facts (Axelsson 2000).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Biology-based techniques</head><p>The following are examples of biology-based techniques such as genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and artificial immune systems, as well as IDS that support these techniques for anomaly-based intrusion detection.</p><p>-Artificial neural networks (ANN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Yegnanarayana 2009)</ref> have been adopted in the field of anomaly intrusion detection, mainly because of their flexibility and adaptability to environmental changes. Hyperview <ref type="bibr">(Debar et al. 1992</ref>) is an early attempt of neural network-based technique for intrusion detection. It consists of two major components. The first component is an expert system that monitors audit trails for known signs of intrusions, while the second is an artificial neural network (ANN) based component that learns the user's behaviour adaptively and fires an alarm when the audit trail devi-ates from this learned behaviour. This ANN is connected to two expert systems. One monitors the operation and the training of the network in order to prevent the network from learning anomalous behaviour for instance and evaluates its output. The other one scans the audit trail for known patterns of intrusion, and together with the output from the first expert system forms an opinion on whether to fire an alarm or not. The decision expert system also provides the ANN with situation awareness data (i.e. data that the audit trail itself does not contain) from the simple current time and date, to the predefined complex state of alert, or state of danger for the system. -Natural immune system (NIS) is one of the complex systems in nature. Its main purpose is to protect the body from damage that can be caused by harmful entities that are mostly foreign. Artificial immune systems (AIS) are a new research field that tries to exploit this complex system in order to develop problem solving techniques such as fault detection problems, function optimization, detection of novelties in time series, and even anomaly detection problems <ref type="bibr">(Aickelin et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gonzalez 2003)</ref>. Native artificial immune system (NAIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Pagnoni and Visconti 2004</ref>) is an intrusion detection system based on the idea of providing computer networks with the technological equivalent of an innate immune system. It works on ma-chines on which either a web server or ftp server has been installed. NAIS provides a completely reliable recognition of normal and abnormal processes, and is able to detect and protect servers against new and unknown attacks. -Swarm intelligence is a family of methods inspired by the behavior of swarms of insects and other animals, like flocks of birds and ant colonies; while evolutionary methods, like genetic algorithms, are based on natural selection among a population of individuals. The most commonly used in this field being genetic algorithms (GA), evolution strategies (ES), ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial immune systems (AIS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Truong et al. 2020</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Other ML-based techniques</head><p>The ) is a data mining based system for detecting network intrusions. MINDS suite contains various modules for collecting and analyzing massive amounts of network traffic including behavioral anomaly detection module, summarization module, scan detection module, and profiling module. Independently, each of these modules provides key insights into the network. For instance, the anomaly detection and scan detection modules detect attacks and other abnormal activities in the network traffic. The profiling module detects the dominant modes of traffic to provide an effective network profile to the analysist, and the summarization module provides a concise representation of the network traffic to allow the network analyst to investigate the anomalous traffic in few screenshots. MINDS involves a network analyst who provides feedback to each of the modules based on their performance for more accurate analysis. -Bayesian modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jensen and Nielsen 2007</ref>) is a branch of ML that is applied to decision making and inferential statistics that deals with probability inference. Bayesian inference uses the knowledge of prior events to predict future events. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node represents a discrete random variable of interest. Each node contains the states of the random variable that it represents and a conditional probability table <ref type="table">.</ref> A naïve Bayesian network is a restricted network that has only two layers and assumes complete independence between the information nodes (i.e., the random variables that can be observed and measured). eBayes TCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Valdes and Skinner 2000)</ref> is an EMERALD (Porras and Neumann 1997) component which applies naïve Bayesian networks to analyse traffic explosions. Its anomalydetection decisions are made using a tree structure in which direct observations of the communication are made at the leaves of the tree, and the belief in a particular state is determined at the root. eBayes TCP consists of two components: a TCP-specific module that interfaces to appropriate EMERALD components and manages TCP sessions, as well as a high-performance Bayesian inference class library. The latter has potential not simply to analyse a specific data stream, but also as a fusion en-gine considering heterogeneous sensors. -Hidden Markov model (HMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Rabiner and Juang 1986</ref>) is a statistical Markov model in which the system is modelled as a Markov process with a finite set of unobserved states. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probabilities called transition probabilities. HMM has been successfully used in several ma-chine learning areas including speech recognition, language processing, as well as, anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Warrender et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yeung and Ding 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Ye et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gao et al. 2006</ref>). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Warrender et al. (1999)</ref> have pointed out that HMM can be us ed to learn the concise and generalizable representation of the "self" identity of a system program by relying on the run-time system calls. The model has a fixed number of states and each state represents the unobservable condition of the system. For each state there is a certain probability of producing any of the observable system outputs and a separate probability indicating next states. The models learned were shown to be able to accurately detect anomalies caused by attacks on the system programs. -Fuzzy logic is a method to computing based on degrees of truth rather than the usual true or false Boolean logic on which the modern computers are based. With fuzzy spaces, fuzzy logic allows an object to belong to different classes at the same time. This makes fuzzy logic a great choice for intrusion detection because the security itself includes fuzziness and the boundary between the normal and anomaly is not well defined. As a result, various fuzzy logic-based approaches have been proposed for anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Yao 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Luo and Bridges 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Karami and Guerrero-Zapata 2015)</ref>. Moreover, the intrusion detection problem involves many numeric attributes in collected data, and various derived statistical measures. Building models directly on numeric data usually causes high detection errors. A behaviour that deviates only slightly from a model may not be detected or a small change in normal behaviour may cause a false positive. With fuzzy logic, it is possible to model these small deviations to keep the false positive/negative rates small. -Decision trees are among the well-known machine learning techniques for classification and prediction. A decision tree is composed of three basic elements: a decision node specifying a test attribute, an edge or a branch corresponding to the one of the possible attribute values which means one of the test attribute outcomes, a leaf which is also named an answer node, contains the class to which the object belongs. Decision trees have been successfully applied in the field of intrusion detection, particularly, for anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lee et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Sindhu et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Sheen and Rajesh 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bilge et al. 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee et al. (2008)</ref> used the ID3 algorithm developed by Quinlan as a learning algorithm to generate decision trees automatically for DoS, R2L, and Scan attacks. EXPOSURE (Bilge et al. 2011) is a system that has been designed to perform largescale, passive DNS (domain name service) analysis to detect and blacklist domains involved in malicious activities such as hosting phishing web pages, SPAM, botnets command and control servers, drop zones, etc. EXPOSURE consists of five main components: Data Collector, Feature Attribution Component, Malicious and Benign Domains Collector, Learning Module, and Classifier. The classifier component is built as a J48 decision tree algorithm, which is an implementation of the C4.5 algorithm that is de-signed for generating either pruned or unpruned C4.5 decision trees. It constructs a decision tree from a set of labelled training set by using the concept of information entropy (i.e., the attribute values of the training set). The experimental results show that EXPOSURE is useful in automatically identifying a wide category of previously unknown malicious domains. -Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory. It relies on pre-processing the data to represent patterns in a high dimension which is typically higher than the original feature space. SVM classifies data as a set of support vectors, which are members of a set of training inputs. These support vec-tors outline a hyper-plane (decision boundary) in the feature space. One of the SMV key features is its good generalization ability of the learning model, which means even from a relatively small training data set, it can still give a good accuracy. Plus, SMV is capable of handling high dimensional data which is very useful to an intrusion detection system <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Zaman and Karray 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sung and Mukkamala 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hu et al. (2003)</ref> proposed an anomaly detection approach based on robust support vector machines (RSVMs). RSVM is a variation of SVM that effectively addresses the over-fitting problem introduced by the noise in the training data set. RSVMs incorporates an averaging technique in the standard SVMs which makes the decision surface smoother and controls the amount of regularization automatically. Experimental results show that RSVMs can provide good generalization ability and high intrusion detection accuracy with low false positives even in the presence of noise. The running time of RSVMs can also be significantly reduced as they generate fewer support vectors than the standard SVMs.</p></div>

In a recent Forbes article , Harel Kodesh, former vice president and CTO of GE Software notes that "if an analytical system on a plane determines an engine is faulty, specialist technicians and engineers must be dispatched to remove and repair the faulty part. Simultaneously, a loaner engine must be provided so the airline can keep up flight operations. The entire deal can easily surpass $200,000.". Clearly the cost of a "false positive" here is greater than the cost of Netflix showing the wrong movie recommendation, or Amazon upselling the wrong product. But the differences go further. This system is likely subject to any number of compliance requirements, and the system's recommended action might trigger a variety of reporting actions. The development of the predictive model is likely significantly more evolved than building a recommender: a variety of live and simulated engine sensor data must be captured; the sensor data likely requires extensive cleaning before use; the model must be trained against the cleansed data; and it must be tested against a test dataset, in simulation, and in production. This process likely relies heavily on a variety of subject matter experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mao et al. 2019)</ref> including systems engineers, maintenance and performance engineers, and more, not to mention the software engineering talent required. Industrial AI thus presents several challenges that differentiate it from consumer and business applications of AI. Some of them are provided below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Technical challenges</head><p>Data acquisition and storage: unlike "born digital" data captured, for example, from web interaction logs, industrial AI systems often rely on data captured from sensors that seek to represent the real world digitally. Unfortunately, this process can result in inherently noisy datasets. Sensor data can also be voluminous. Acquiring this data and storing it for analysis can be extremely complex. Furthermore, because of the cost of generating training data under a wide variety of conditions, simulation is often used. High-fidelity simulations, or "digital twins," can be very effective, but can also be difficult to create and maintain, and computationally expensive to run <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fuller et al. 2019)</ref>. Training challenges: much of the recent fanfare around AI has been based on the success of "deep learning." In most cases, these successes are based on supervised learning style problems in which deep neural networks are trained with labeled training data. While it can be difficult in any domain to collect the volume of labeled training data required to effectively train machine learning models, this can be particularly challenging in industrial scenarios in which few examples of the most interesting "black swan" events-such as part or product failures-occur <ref type="bibr">(Pinker 2018)</ref>. This increases the complexity of training and thus the overall cost of developing the machine learning system. Testing costs and complexity: testing AI systems on operating production lines, industrial equipment, warehouses and other industrial systems is both expensive and disruptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Kalajdzic et al. 2015)</ref>. Because of this, industrial AI systems are often trained and tested using simulation, the challenges of which have already been discussed. Large state spaces: modern industrial systems are extremely complex, often offering tens or hundreds of inputs over which machine learning algorithms may optimize. This can make for more complex development and training routines (both in terms of time and cost) and can require the use of sophisticated techniques to simplify the problem and ensure convergence to a solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Operational challenges</head><p>High cost of failure and change: as we saw in our aircraft engine example , it is common in industrial scenarios for the cost of failure to be extremely high. The cost of change is similarly high. When an enterprise has many millions of dollars invested in factories and warehouses, automation technology-AI or otherwise-must either work with those existing investments or demonstrate extremely compelling ROI. Cost of talent: data scientists, data engineers and data-savvy programmers and subject matter ex-perts are the backbone of the team required to implement AI solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Mao et al. 2019</ref>). These skills are both rare and expensive in today's employment market, and firms must compete for top talent with internet leaders like Facebook and Google.</p><p>High regulatory requirements: industrial environments are often subject to compliance statutes that impact operations, including technical, legal and corporate requirements, and governmental regulations. Depending on the market and industry, compliance requirements span areas such as product safety, public/employee health and safety, environmental impact, and workplace safety, but they can also directly specify controls around automation systems, as does, for example, the European Machinery Directive (European Commission 2009). Regulatory controls, which often require that changes to industrial processes be extensively validated and verified, can be at odds with the goals of automation via AI, which encourage rapid adaptation of processes via closed-loop feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Security challenges</head><p>Unpredictability of Industrial AI-based systems: as previously highlighted, industrial AI tends to make the modern ICS less deterministic in their functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Sun et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In recent years the use of AI technologies is increasing, giving rise to several initiatives related to the detection of anomalies. Specifically, the detection of anomalies attempts to solve the problem of identifying patterns of behavior that do not correspond to the expected patterns. The boundaries between anomalous and expected behaviors may be difficult to establish precisely and may also vary over time. This is likely to cause the most traditional IDS technology to fail detecting new threats or to misclassify new benign events as anomalies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Luo et al. 2020)</ref>. Without adapted measures and improvements, security professionals will have to deal with an increasing number of false positives and false negatives. Exposure to adversarial AI: attackers are likely to acquire equivalent skills in ML/DM techniques to those mastered by cybersecurity professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Stevens 2020)</ref>. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each state of the art method, trained attackers will undoubtedly look for techniques to wrong ML-based systems. This could apply to IDS but also to other MLbased technology in use in the context of Indus-try 4.0, such as autonomous and collaborative robotics. Adversarial AI technology may be used to learn the specific weaknesses of defensive or functional ML/DM modules involved in critical industrial assets, for example, targeting detection thresholds, generating noise to hide malicious events, aiming at the computational limits of a particular ML algorithm or finding a way to corrupt the training data <ref type="bibr">(Brundage et al. 2018)</ref>. For this reason, it is important to test and train defensive ML algorithms against adversarial AI and not only against static data-sets. According to some recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Qiu et al. 2019)</ref>, GAN (Generative adversarial network) are a promising method for Adversarial.</p><p>Machine learning based techniques leverage collected security data, and ingest the statistical pow-er of the information to further automate the process of pattern matching. Other than traditional signature based techniques, the benefits of adoption of learning based predictive models explore the behavioral evidences in the data, which can potentially offer defensive advantages such as alerts of unseen attacks. However, learning-based methods themselves can be security targets by manipulating training and testing data samples, known as adversarial samples. For instance, a face recognition system based on pretrained deep neural networks can easily fail to detect faces wearing a pair of glass that is carefully crafted under adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Sharif et al. 2016)</ref>. Anyone wearing this peculiar glass will be recognized as another certain person trained as the target.</p><p>Theoretical studies on machine learning models also show that AI-based methods should be deployed carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Sculley et al. 2015)</ref>. The predictive power of learning models relies heavily on true sample distribution of the collected data, which can be misleading when the data is tainted by attackers (Biggio and Roli 2018). Learning algorithms are intrinsically vulnerable to malicious data manipulation. In functional view, a learning model is typically parametrized by a set of parameters (see Neural Networks), if attackers can gain insight into the model architecture and manipulate their data so that they are misclassified, this is a particular type of adversarial machine learning attack, known as exploratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Siddiqi 2019)</ref>. Such adversarial samples can be computed by gradient ascent. Adversarial attacks were successfully conducted on those widely used machine learning algorithms such as SVM and LASSO by carefully crafting malicious data samples for model training. The adversarial attacks can be generalized to the whole family of statistical learning theory based methods, therefore can be contagious, and many learning systems can be affected.</p><p>Responsibility gap: in order to ensure that industrial AI systems are socially acceptable, their development, deployment and use must be guided by the principles of rule of law, notably its manifestations in legal certainty and accountability. In light of the increasing levels of interaction between humans and machines and the emergence of new (cognitive) interfaces to support this interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lim et al. 2017)</ref>, there is growing uncertainty about maintaining legal compliance in continuously evolving dynamic environments. Technically, it is difficult a validate the security properties of AI-based systems in general. IDS in particular set a many times addressed challenge for validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Tavallaee et al. 2010)</ref>. Traditionally, the approach of lawmakers and regulators to safety-critical systems has been limited to embedding strict deterministic design and certification technical requirements into legal and regulatory instruments. Conservatism and end-to-end predictability in all circumstances have shaped these processes even in highly automated environments such as the aerospace domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Emanuilov 2017)</ref>. Autonomous systems, however, have challenged these premises. The existing legal and regulatory approaches to autonomous systems cannot sufficiently accommodate the inherently uncertain, adaptive and non-deterministic behaviour of these systems. Certification and continued maintenance of assured level of compliance in the course of a system's evolution are two cases in point. It is no longer sufficient to adhere to a finite set of end goals because these systems continuously evolve in time and space as a result of their learning feedback loops and incessant interaction with the surrounding environment. Therefore, a thorough understanding from a technical and cognitive perspective of the emerging cross-organisational and cross-entity interactions is essential for designing new legal and regulatory approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">AI threat landscape</head><p>To illustrate the security challenges, it is important to draw a picture of AI threats, as known today and potential further developments which would likely harm FoFs. Most existing classifications of AI threats address AI as a new attack surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Turchin 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Turchin and Denkenberger 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Yampolskiy 2016)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Turchin and Denkenberger (2020)</ref> propose a classification of catastrophic risks according to the level of AI intelligence. The three proposed levels are: (i) "Narrow AI" associated with the current AI systems that require human intervention, (ii) "Young AI" associated with the youngest age of AI where its capabilities are slightly above human level, and (iii) "Mature AI" associated with the superintelligent level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Yampolskiy (2016)</ref> classified the types of pathways leading to malicious AI system into two stages: pre-deployment and post-deployment. The proposed taxonomy categorizes the AI risks into potential internal and external causes such as design mistakes, deliberate action, or environmental hazards. These studies focus generally on AI risks from the safety point of view. A couple of studies have more specifically addressed AI-based cyberthreats such as AI-based malware <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kirat et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chung et al. 2019)</ref> or spyware <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">(Zhang et al. 2018</ref><ref type="bibr">), password guessing (Hitaj et al. 2017</ref> or brute-force techniques (Trieu and Yang 2018), social bots <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Seymour and Tully 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bahnsen et al. 2018;</ref>, and of adversarial training <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hu and Tan 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anderson et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Petro and Morris 2017)</ref>. The above mentioned studies demonstrate that AI provides superiority in scope, speed, and scale compared to traditional approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Schneier (2018)</ref> says that "both attack and defense will benefit from AI technologies". However,as attackers have the advantage of initiative and as AI tremendously augments attack speed it might create new asymmetries in the attack-defense balance. A recent survey from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kaloudi and Li (2020)</ref> provides an understanding of the existing threat landscape, and a framework for attack classification along the Cyber Kill Chain 188. It highlights potential for AI-enhancement at each step of the Kill Chain: (1) AI-targeted reconnaissance; (2) AI-aided vaporization; (3) AI-concealed delivery; (4) AI-automated exploitation; (5) AI-evolved installation; (6) AImultilayered C2; (7) AI-massive action. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kaloudi and Li (2020)</ref> illustrate their framework by describing a fictive attack scenario against smart grid infrastructure. In the preparation phase heuristic risk graph methods can be used to identify the critical path to cascading failures as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Zhu et al. (2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yan et al. (2017)</ref> demonstrate how reinforcement learning can help identifying the critical attack sequence. With these approach, even an actor ignoring the specifics of smart grid infrastructures can quickly become aware of exploitable dependencies. A password brute-force malware such as <ref type="bibr">Trieu and Yang (2018)</ref> can be used to acquire passwords of authorised personnel. Smart meters can be turned to a large botnet and shut off at once <ref type="bibr">(Anderson and Fuloria 2010)</ref>. The use of evasive malware <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kirat et al. 2018</ref>) based on deep learning algorithms makes the need for a remote control control channel obsolete as the weapon can autonomously discover its environment and spread according to an optimized path. Essentially, what applies to smart grids would largely apply to another type of CPS such as the FoF with different, but no less meaningful impacts.</p><p>5 Vision for AI-based cyber-resilience of Industry 4.0</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Towards human/machine behavior monitoring</head><p>Many experiments of ML/DM-based detection show a certain weakness in properly detecting User to Remote (U2R) attacks. This is the case for Naïve Bayes as demonstrated by Amor et al.

This weakness raises concern when we consider how preva-lent is the involvement of insiders in real attacks ( &gt; 70% ). From a computing perspective, a U2R and a legitimate user action may not look very different. Therefore, these scenarios may never find proper countermeasures in traditional intrusion detection techniques, but rather in their combination with anomaly detection techniques applying to human behavior. Monitoring physiological, emotional and mental state of users in future factories might help reinforcing or rejecting the suspicion raised by weak signals analysis in ICS environments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this work we aimed at highlighting the dual role of AI in intelligent manufacturing systems. We first provide insights on the advent of AI in Industry 4.0, introducing use-cases which range from passive monitoring to prescriptive optimization or even proactive process control ( §2). Then we introduce common ICS security practices, describe the many uses of ML/DM techniques in field of intrusion detection, and examine their applicability to existing OT environments ( §3). Finally we expose the challenges related with AI uses and misuses in the FoF, embracing safety and security issues with consideration for AI as a target, as a threat and as a tool. Both Industrial AI and ML/DM-based security techniques struggle with the need of data in required quantity, quality and diversity. For convenience, a description of existing public data sets and a description of data types needed for IDS training is provided in Annex B. A description of selected IDS products and solutions applicable to OT environments is also provided in Annex C. It gives an informative overlook on respective strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions with regards to intrusion detection in industrial environments.</p><p>Intrinsic security of AI has mainly been addressed by safety-oriented studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Turchin 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Turchin and Denkenberger 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Yampolskiy 2016)</ref>, potentially ignoring the pernicious nature of intentional threats.

In this work, we have identified other problems, left relatively unaddressed by research and industry, such as the need for correlation and orchestration of detection capacities across network, edge and host ( §4.5); the potential for adversarial training of defensive AI to achieve intrinsic robustness of future industrial and security applications ( §4.6); and the requirement for improved monitoring of human-machine behavior in a context where decisions are increasingly made by or supported by AI ( §4.7). Eventually the proposition is to increment AI-based OT monitoring, optimization and control capacities depicted in §2 together with a complementary AIbased resilience capacity as suggested in §4. With this we intend to turn AI from a threat to an opportunity for enhanced security of smart manufacturing. Such promises can be found in starting research and innovation projects such as CyberFactory#1 (ITEA3 Project Nr17032) and SeCoIIA (H2020 Project Nr 871967). new attacks. In 1999, intrusion detection systems were tested as part of an off-line evaluation, a real time evaluation or both. <ref type="bibr">-KDD 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">(Stolfo 1999</ref> The amount of available rules makes it very likely that the NIDS is an overlay of an existing NIDS (such as Snort). However, Leidos mentions that they create specific rules from the ICS typical at-tacks. Even if the solution is very promising with its exhaustive approach, it is very linked with the US government which may be a reason to be rejected for monitoring of critical infrastructures in Europe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C.2: Anomaly-based IDS</head><p>Because state of the art ICS are so predictable in their behavior and employ specific and simple protocols, most existing OT IDS rely on anomaly detection. The following are examples selected among the most well-known anomaly-based industrial security products.</p><p>-Claroty is an Israeli company founded in 2016, with a headquarter based in the US and a research and development staff based on Israel. The Claroty company proposes a set of components fully dedi-cated to cyber security of industrial networks. Among their OT security platform, the Enterprise Management component collects events from the monitoring virtual appliance to build dashboards and send alert data to external systems such as SIEMs, log managers and ticket request systems. The network anomaly-based detection (deterministic and behavioural models) is performed in a passive mode with DPI, using a span port (no agents) or connecting to sensors on serial networks. Both seri-al and Ethernet networks can be monitored. Raised events are linked to assets (e.g., PLCs, HMIs) modelled in the Claroty's knowledge base. Along with the network intrusion detection, Claroty provides a change monitoring from commands observed from the network. A large range of IT and OT protocols are supported. Sentryo CyberVision supports a wide range of industrial protocols and the main IT protocols. Focusing on industrial pro-tocols: Modbus, OPC-DA/UA, IEC 61850, EtherNet/ IP + CIP, PROFINET and Siemens S7. Sentryo per-formed a PoC on a railway infrastructure use case with a railway-related manufacturer, specifically on signalling and control-command. They added support on specific protocols from this manufactur-er and implemented some threat scenarios (no details provided on these scenarios).</p><p>detection engine is not very well detailed. Cyberbit mentions an automated blacklisting and white-listing capability to detect abnormal situations. Cypres This French solution comes from a research project funded by the EU, led by FPC Ingénierie and with Netceler, two SMEs specialized in industrial automation, software development and cyber security. This non-intrusive solution is dedicated to ICS/SCADA networks. Intrusions are detected by rule-based IDS probes. Cypres probes can also detect non legitimate machines and protocols. Rules are contextualized, meaning they take the system state and ongoing operations into consideration. Contexts are acquired through a learning process. Another type of rules is based on a heuristic engine that checks anomalies of processes, depending on the replicability of the process controls. The project is still ongoing. Since this solution has been deployed in the frame of proof of concept (PoC) only, it probably lacks of maturity. However, no PoC has been performed on the rail-way domain so far.</p><p>Nozomi Nozomi is a Swiss company founded in 2013, with headquarters in the USA. Nozomi is the editor of the SCADAGuardian solution. This solution includes a network IDS, a process anomaly detection system and a cyber risk evaluation system. The IDS relies on a signature-based DPI engine. The solution is design to address multi-site security monitoring and includes a Central Management Console (CMC) to aggregate from multiple sites and centralize the cyber security awareness. The solution supports many ICS and IT protocols. Focusing on industrial protocols: Aspentech Cim/IO, BAC-Net, Beckhoff ADS, BSAP IP, CEI 79-5/2-3, COT P, DNP3, Enron Modbus, EtherCAT, Eth-erNet/IP -CIP, Foundation Fieldbus, Generic MMS, GOOSE, Honeywell, IEC 60870-5-7 (IEC 62351-3 + IEC 62351-5), IEC 60870-5-104, IEC-61850 (MMS, GOOSE, SV), IEC DLMS/COSEM, ICCP, Modbus/TCP, MQTT, OPC, PI-Connect, Profinet/DCP, Profinet/I-O CM, Profinet/ RT, Sercos III, Siemens S7, Vnet/IP. Nozomi provides a SDK that enables a customer to extend support for new protocols. SCADAShield comes in more than 10 appliance versions (physical or virtual). It is worth mentioning that the technical documentation publicly available on SCADAShield is very detailed and clear, which is usually not the case for its competitors.</p><p>Radiflow Radiflow is an Israeli company founded in 2009. The solution developed by Radiflow for SCADA networks is iSID. The iSID solution embeds an anomaly-based detection engine. The change monitoring process relies on the knowledge of the existing assets along with used protocols and sessions. To get this knowledge, an asset topology discovery capacity has been implemented. The learning process makes the iSID solution able to detect any change in the network topology such as new sessions. A DPI system relying on a set of rules analyses the network traffic to detect any policy violations. The list of supported protocols is not publicly available. Some papers and datasheets mention: Modbus, DNP3, IEC-104 and 61850. The iSID solution also manages vulnerabilities by both active and passive scans. Then their signature-based Cyber Attack module uses this information to detect any vulnerability exploitation by an attacker. Incident response is managed through an inter-face with the Radiflow security gateway: iSID is able to push policy modifications into the Radiflow security gateway.</p><p>are not considered relevant for an objective comparison. Detection rates and false positive rates highly depend on the data sets used for evaluation and the training method (in the case of ML-based detection) or the human experts involved in rule edition (in the case of misuse detection). To date there is not any agreed international standard for assessment of detection performance. Existing certification frameworks for IDS focus on assessing the protective functions. While such as technical assessment would surely be of interest, it would require significant resources and the cooperation of product vendors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 Fig. 3</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Arm-race framework to address the transition from reactive to proactive defense.

It contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks. It also includes the results of the network traffic analysis using a network traffic flow generator with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attack. Morris and Gao 2014): 4 data sets were developed by Thomas Morris and Wei Gao in a project entitled "Industrial Control System Traffic Data Sets for Intrusion Detection Research". They include network traffic, process control and process measurement features from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems. They were generated from network flow records captured with a serial port data logger in a laboratory environment. They contain transactions from a gas pipeline system and a water storage tank system. A set of 28 attacks were grouped into four categories: reconnaissance, response injection, command injection and denialof-service attacks. Although MODBUS is a particular SCADA protocol, the authors claim their data sets are relevant to a wide variety of SCADA systems and would apply to other than pipeline or water storage ICS.The DARPA, KDD and CICIDS2017 data sets contain network level and kernel level data representative of IT networks and appropriate for training and testing of generic NIDS. They may contain useful data for OT IDS but would not to address the very specificities of such environments. They are how-ever useful to assess IDS performance as they are widely used and thus form a potential reference for comparison of performances. The ADFA data set is dedicated to HIDS training and testing. It is useful to work on detection of industrial endpoint -The CIDDS-001 (Coburg Intrusion Detection Data Set), disclosed by Markus Ring et al. in [8], contains about four weeks of network traffic from two different environments, an emulated small business environment (OpenStack) and an External Server that captured real and up-to-date traffic from the internet. The OpenStack environment includes several clients and typical servers like an E-Mail server or a Web server. The dataset contains labeled flow-based data that can be used to evaluate anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems considering normal activity as well as DoS, Brute Force, Ping Scans and Port Scan attacks. The collection of data provided by the CIDDS-001 dataset is represented in an Netflow format. Netflow is a feature of CISCO routers that allows the collection of IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. Defence and Space Cybersecurity based on an analysis of product documentation and vendor questionnaires. Most signature-based IDS are originally designed for IT security. The following three products have been short listed for their applicability to ICS/SCADA environments. Many other IDS exist on the market which however do not equally match the specific requirements of OT environments. -Cisco IPS, Firepower, is a signature-based and agent-less solution that embeds SCADArelated rulesets. The IPS uses deep packet inspection (DPI) to detect attacks. The detection process starts by normalizing received packets and goes on parallel inspection at various levels (e.g., IP headers, TCP payloads). Signatures are built from vulnerability bulletins, provided an exploit is known. More than 35,000 vulnerability-focused rules are available. As an IPS, Firepower manages a prevention policy and especially one dedicated to industrial protocols (e.g., Modbus, ICCP). -Fortinet propose an IPS solution embedded in their firewall offer, FortiGate. There is a specific range adapted to industrial environments, meaning appliances are designed to resist to tempera-ture constraints (very low, very high, variations), vibrations, etc. Additionally Fortinet propose a range of security solutions such as switches, web analyzers and central managers for industry-focused cyber security. FortiGate IPS is a signature-based IPS. It supports BACnet, DLMS/COSEM, DNP3, EtherCAT, ICCP, IEC-60870.5.104, Modbus/TCP, OPC, PROFINET. A combination of Fortinet and Nozomi solutions extends this list and provides anomaly detection capacity. -Leidos Industrial Defender ASM is a US solution, owned by Leidos. It is a cyber security solution that in-cludes asset discovery and management, compliance monitoring, reporting and security event mon-itoring. The solution relies on a three-tier architecture with a manager (ASM), local appliances (ASA) and a signature-based NIDS. In terms of protocols, the NIDS supports Modbus, TCP, DNP3, Profibus, ODVA Ethernet/IP, and ICCP, and generate alarms that are sent to the ASM for logging and diagnosis.</figDesc><table><row><cell>The implemented attacks include Brute Force FTP, Brute Force SSH, DoS, Heartbleed , Web Attack, Infiltra-tion, Botnet and DDoS within 5 days of traffic. -ADFA data sets (2013-2014): the ADFA data sets provide kernel level data for HIDS training and testing.

Indegy provides an ICS Cyber Security Platform that detects changes to controller logic, configuration, firmware and state. The anomaly-based Indegy IDS includes a DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) engine that focuses on control-layer events. All supported protocols are not publicly available: Modbus and DNP3 are mentioned only. Even if not detailed, the approach is based on the technical asset discovery (devices, configuration and state) and addresses multi-site contexts. Sensors are deployed on sites, and the analysis is made on a sin-gle point by a centralized analyzer. -SecurityMatters is a Dutch company founded in 2009 that develops the SilentDefense solution, a hybrid IDS. This solution provides automatic asset and network flows discovery. This information is used by the anomaly-based engine. The SilentDefense DPI engine comes with more than 800 rules. It detects cyber attacks and network misconfiguration. The solution supports many ICS and IT proto-cols.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Appendix A: Nature, types and sources of data for ML-based IDS Appendix A.1: Data types for ML/DM applied to IDS As we highlighted the importance of data quality and quantity to DM/ML techniques, it is important to highlight the diverse nature of data which can be used for intrusion detection. A first distinction is between Packet level data and Netflow data. Packet level data: the packets transmitted through network infrastructures can be captured by a specific Application Programming Interface (API) called pcap. IDS and other network security equipment use Libpcap and WinPCap as packet capture libraries of Unix and Windows respectively. The Ethernet frame contains an Ethernet header such as media access control <ref type="bibr">[MAC]</ref> address, and up to 1500 bytes [maximum transmission unit (MTU)] of payload which contains the IP packet made of IP header and IP payload where the data content lies. The features captured from pcap interface vary depending on the protocols carried in the packet. IP addresses are captured in the IP header.</p><p>NetFlow Data: NetFlow was originally a router feature by Cisco, enabling to collect IP Network traffic as it enters or leaves the network equipment. In its version 5, NetFlow is defined as a unidirectional sequence of packets that share the exact same seven packet attributes: ingress interface, source IP address, destination IP address, IP protocol, source port, destination port, and IP type of service. NetFlow data include a compressed and preprocessed version of the actual network packets.</p><p>Kernel level data: the kernel is the core of a computer's operating system. It handles requests from applications, sends instructions to central processing unit, allocates computing resource, and man-ages memory and peripherals. Kernel level data can be analyzed to provide evidence of attacks on the endpoint. The analysis would be specific to the type of operating system monitored. Kernel behavior analysis can be performed based on expert rules, statistical approaches or DM/ML techniques. It could rely on endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents or Host IDS (HIDS). An interesting field of investigation is the correlation is the correlation of alerts raised by network level and kernel level IDS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A.2: Public data sets for IDS training and testing</head><p>ML/DM methods require vast amounts of data, in most cases labeled, in any case representative from real network traffic and free of use. Data collection is a painful step. Network data are usually subject to confidentiality and privacy issues. This is particularly the case of OT networks which usual-ly bear company or utility confidential data. A comparison of performance in intrusion detection between two projects is only valid if they use the same data set. For those reasons, public data sets have been collected and shared across the research community.</p><p>-DARPA 1998 : this data set was created by the Lincoln Laboratory from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1998 to support an offline evaluation of IDS on network traffic and audit logs collect-ed on a simulation network. -DARPA 1999 : also created by the Lincoln Laboratory, this data set contained three weeks of training data among which only the second week contained a selected subset of attacks from the 1998 evaluation in addition to several The Suricata project is quite dynamic: a version is released every 2 or 3 months. -Bro Presented in 1999 by V. Parxson, Bro is not restricted to any particular detection approach and does not rely on traditional signatures. Then Bro's detection principle is completely different from Snort. As a consequence, it may be more efficient than Snort on some types of intrusion. Addition-ally, it embeds a capacity of network flow analysis (including performance measurements). Howev-er, Bro is less used than Snort, probably because it does not have any graphical user interface and has to be fully configured in command line mode. Furthermore, it only runs on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X operating systems. Despite these limitations, it remains widely used by academics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix B.1: Synthesis on Open source IDS solutions</head><p>Snort benefits from a large support by the community. It is integrated with many other systems (e.g., rule providers, SIEM) and add-ons make it adaptable to many usages (IT and OT). Suricata-the Snort challenger-is scalable but requires extensive computing resources. Bro is an IDS mostly used by academics and would require a lot of effort to make it usable in an operational environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix C: Vendor OT IDS solutions</head><p>Many commercial solutions use one or several frameworks coming from the above mentioned open source tools. Still the effectiveness of IDS solutions highly relies on the capacity of a company to write relevant rules, and to analyze customer architecture and needs. The analysis of vendor solu-tions below results from an assessment carried out by Airbus</p></div>

Cyberbit Founded in 2015, Cyberbit is an Israeli company, editor of the SCADAShield and EDR solutions.
