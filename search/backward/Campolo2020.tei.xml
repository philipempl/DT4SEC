<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The proliferation of devices equipped with positioning capabilities has recently opened the way to the development of a plethora of location-based applications. Tracking the user mobility can be helpful to identify the best transport solution to satisfy her needs, to infer her preferences and predict future travel demands. Retrieving mobility data from fleets of Public Transport (PT) vehicles can support the route planning and enable the design of improved solutions for customers. Both user and vehicle mobility data can feed Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applications tracking the mobility of commuters which need to dynamically compose their trips through solutions of different travel operators, spanning different means of transportation, e.g., bike, car, bus, planes, trains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Besides positioning systems, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are needed to enable the collection, delivery, processing, and presentation of the mobility-related information to all the interested parties.</p><p>In our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> we identified prominent solutions addressing most of the aforementioned functionalities by encouraging the joint usage of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the lightweight messaging protocol specifically devised for Internet of Things (IoT) environments, and the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> resource description model. This results into interoperable and efficient data retrieval and description. Moreover, there we argued in favour of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> facilities to host MaaS services by offering lower latency and higher context-awareness compared to the remote cloud.</p><p>In this paper we make a step forward and extend the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> by providing the following main innovative contributions:</p><p>• We propose the usage of Digital Twins (DTs), acting as digital counterparts of physical entities, e.g., smartphones of commuters, On Board Systems (OBSs) of PT vehicles. They are in charge of retrieving mobility data of the corresponding physical entities and can be queried by stakeholders interested to such data. • We design DTs as virtualized applications to be hosted at the network edge. This is a clear departure from the current literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> according to which DTs are hosted in the remote cloud. Moreover, we align the deployment to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) MEC reference architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. • We consider two different messaging protocols. In addition to CoAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, coupled with OMA LwM2M investigated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we also leverage Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. • We assess the feasibility of the proposed framework through a realistic experimental validation conducted during a trip taken by a bus in a urban environment. During the trip, position information are retrieved through a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver attached to a Rasbperry Pi device <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. • We quantitatively compare the two considered messaging protocols for what concerns the efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage, and the effectiveness in terms of packet reliability. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background material about the enabling technologies and concepts of the proposed framework, which is then described in Section III. The experimental setup is described in Section IV, as well as the main findings of the evaluation study. Final remarks are reported in Section V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MAIN TECHNOLOGY ENABLERS</head><p>A. Multi-access edge computing: a primer MEC has been proposed by ETSI as a prominent paradigm offering computing and storage resources at the edge of the mobile network, close to the subscribers. It provides highbandwidth and ultra-low latency access to radio network as well as context information, which can be exploited by many 978-1-7281-7343-6/20/$31.00 © 2020 IEEE verticals, such as transportation, industrial automation, entertainment, media, healthcare.</p><p>The reference ETSI architecture has been specified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> with a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for key MEC interfaces, along with the main functionalities.</p><p>The ME host is the entity that contains the ME platform and a virtualization infrastructure which offers computing, storage, and network resources for the ME applications. Such applications can interact with the ME platform to consume and offer ME services. Services offered by the platform are, for instance, the Radio Network Information Service (RNIS) and the Location Service (LS), respectively providing radio-related and augmented positioning information.</p><p>The ME orchestrator is the core of the ETSI MEC architecture. It decides which ME host(s) is(are) the most appropriate one(s) for application instantiation (and relocation) according to application demands (e.g., latency), monitored available resources, and also mobility conditions.</p><p>The deployment of ME hosts in the edge domain is operatorspecific: an ME host can be associated either to each Base Station (BS) or to a set of them, covering either a small area or offering a urban coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Digital Twins</head><p>Originally developed to improve manufacturing processes, now digital twins have a wider scope by representing the digital replications of living as well as non-living entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Such replications are designed as the semantic description of the sensed physical world <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, also incorporating contextual and sensor data from them. This makes the service discovery easier, since metadata is used to index the virtual devices, and the introduced semantic description is able to cope with heterogeneity to provide interoperability among physical devices at a virtual level. As a result, the digital twin enables data to be seamlessly transmitted between the physical and virtual worlds, hence ensuring real-time monitoring of systems, helpful for their maintenance and for future upgrades.</p><p>The DT concept can be also leveraged in the automotive domain. Starting from collected mobility data, vehicle, bus and truck manufacturers can devise solutions to improve customer's satisfaction and vehicle fleets management <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Today, the common practice is storing and updating the DTs of vehicles and other physical entities in the remote cloud <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK</head><p>In this paper, we treasure the previously described concepts and technologies and apply them to efficiently and effectively track the mobility of commuters and of PT vehicles in order to collect valuable data for PT service monitoring and planning.</p><p>To this aim, we propose the framework graphically sketched in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We distinguish three different domains: (i) the ground domain, with commuters and PT vehicles which are connected to the mobile network; (ii) the edge domain, hosting the virtual counterparts of the physical entities, both for the commuters and the PT vehicles; (iii) the remote applications through which third parties, such as the road authorities, the transport operators, the municipality and the MaaS provider, can get mobility data of commuters/PT vehicles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. The ground domain</head><p>We track the mobility of vehicles like buses, as well as of commuters. The first ones are equipped with multi-interface OBSs, whereas commuters carry a smartphone, both acting as User Equipment (UE). Each UE runs a UE App that interacts with the corresponding counterpart in the ME host, which is the DT App.</p><p>The OBS is equipped with a GPS transceiver and, similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, with a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon that broadcasts a series of identifiers. BLE on board the bus is leveraged to facilitate e-ticketing procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Information about the commuter position is retrieved through the GPS receiver of the smartphone. However, whenever the UE App infers the smartphone to be on board the bus, the GPS receiver is switched off to reduce the energy consumption of the device. Hence, the smartphone offloads to the OBS the task of updating the DT with its location data.</p><p>Unlike in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> where the smartphone of the commuter connects to the on-board Wi-Fi network and is detected to be on board, in this work, smartphones of passengers receiving BLE identifiers infer to be on-board the bus.</p><p>As defined also in Android Location manager <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , in order to affect battery lifetime as little as possible, the UE App on the smartphone will communicate with the corresponding DT App only when necessary, i.e., whenever its position changes of at least minDistance meters. The same workaround applies to the OBS. However, being the OBS powered, it is not concerned about battery consumption. Notwithstanding, for the OBS such an approach has the advantage of reducing the amount of data exchanged over the mobile network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. The edge domain</head><p>DTs are deployed as virtualized applications at the edge. In particular, without loss of generality, we assume that they are instantiated at the closest ME host. The selection of the most proper ME host where the DT of a given commuter/PT vehicle has to be placed is performed by the ME orchestrator and is outside the scope of the present work.</p><p>Each DT App interacts with the UE App to get mobility data. Compared to the work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> which considers only vehicles as physical entities, we extend the concept of DT to commuters.</p><p>Data are locally stored at the edge and periodically transferred to the remote cloud for long-term storage and analytics purposes. Besides benefiting from low latency access to storage and computing services close to where they are needed, DT applications hosted in MEC facilities can further access additional (context) information and provide accurate positioning via data fusion from multiple available sources, also improved by the ME LS. Retrieved mobility data have typically a citywide scope and could benefit from local processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Interactions between physical devices and DTs</head><p>In alignment with the existing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, for the interaction between physical devices and their corresponding DTs we consider two of the most widespread IoT messaging protocols, as detailed in the following.</p><p>1) MQTT: The first option relies on MQTT, a lightweight messaging protocol largely used in IoT contexts in presence of small sensors and mobile devices, optimized for unreliable networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The MQTT protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> leverages a publish/subscribe approach, in which a client subscribes to a topic and receives notifications via a server whenever a new message is generated on that topic by the node acting as publisher. An MQTT server plays the role of message broker between publishers and subscribers. MQTT leverages the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) at the transport layer. In addition, it uses three levels of message transmission reliability. With Quality of Service (QoS)=0 (a.k.a. at most once delivery), messages are simply sent once and are not acknowledged. With QoS=1 (a.k.a. at least once delivery), acknowledgements are used and messages are retransmitted if no acknowledgement is received before the expiration of a timeout. With QoS=2 (a.k.a. exactly once delivery), a four-way handshake is used to ensure that a message arrives exactly once.</p><p>In our framework, the MQTT publisher is implemented within the UE App. The DT hosts an MQTT subscriber which is interested in retrieving data published by the corresponding physical device (either the smartphone or the OBS). The MQTT broker is deployed as an ME app. Several publishers and subscribers may exchange messages through the same broker.</p><p>2) CoAP and OMA LwM2M: As a second option we consider CoAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, a well-known protocol which allows IoT devices to operate in a Web-like fashion. CoAP request/response methods allow the interaction between a client, which in the CoAP terminology refers to the node requesting data, and the server, i.e., the node hosting the resource (e.g., the value of a temperature, a location), which is typically an IoT device.</p><p>The connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is leveraged as a transport protocol and therefore retransmissions are managed at the application-layer. In particular, applications can send reliable (confirmable) or non-reliable (non-confirmable) CoAP messages. Confirmable messages are retransmitted until acknowledged by the receiver or until a maximum number of retransmissions has been reached.</p><p>In addition to the request/response approach typical of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), CoAP can also work in a publish/subscribe manner through the OBSERVE extension, which enables efficient asynchronous monitoring of IoT resources. CoAP clients can send a request with an OBSERVE header option to a CoAP resource, described through a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The CoAP server tracks such subscriptions and sends a Notification message to the clients whenever the observed resource changes. In the reference scenario of our study, the position of a commuter does not change when she is at the bus stop; the same holds for a PT vehicle stopped at a red traffic light. Hence, the OBSERVE extension saves bandwidth resources and, consequently, battery of the (mobile) device acting as server, compared to the GET/POST primitives <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The OMA LwM2M protocol complements CoAP with a simple object-based resource model to facilitate interoperability in resource description and discovery. Its usage in vehicular domains is also suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In our framework, we assume that a OMA LwM2M client is implemented within the UE App. It is in charge of retrieving data from the GPS (of the smartphone, of the OBS) and sending them through CoAP to the OMA LwM2M server, which is implemented in the ME host and which the DT has access to.</p><p>3) Mobility data: For both messaging protocols options, the same information is transmitted. More precisely, starting from the Location object (object id 6) defined in the OMA LwM2M Object and Resource Registry 2 , only the essential mobility-related data are transmitted. Such fields are Latitude, Longitude, Timestamp and Speed, as reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref> and requested through a URI and a topic for the CoAP and OMA LwM2M and the MQTT options, respectively. The meaning of such fields is reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. The remote applications</head><p>Different stakeholders may be interested in the mobility data of commuters and PT vehicles. In order to preserve the security/privacy of potentially sensitive data related to commuters and/or owned by transport operators, each DT may expose such data to requesting authorized applications through properly configured views.</p><p>Traditional HTTP primitives can then be used by the remote applications to query the DTs. Indeed, there is no need for lightweight protocols (like CoAP) as when, instead, interacting with resource-constrained physical devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION A. Experimental setup</head><p>The objective of the evaluation study is twofold and specifically it aims (i) to provide a Proof of Concept (PoC) of the proposed framework by leveraging off-the-shelf components and (ii) to compare the considered messaging protocols in terms of effectiveness and efficiency under different settings.</p><p>More in detail, the analysis focuses on capturing mobility data of a PT vehicle during a bus ride in a urban context. Hence the interactions between the OBS and the corresponding DT are only considered. In so doing, thanks to the offloading policy for the positioning tasks, the mobility of commuters on board the bus can be also tracked.</p><p>1) Hardware components: For the OBS implementation, we leveraged a Raspberry Pi <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, an inexpensive, fully customizable and programmable single board computer with support for a large number of input/output peripherals and network communication interfaces. We attached to such a board the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout receiver <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, a high-quality and energy-efficient GPS module that can track up to 22 satellites on 66 channels, with an excellent high-sensitivity receiver, and a built-in antenna.</p><p>To collect position data to be sent to the DT, a trip of around 7 km has been performed in a urban environment, i.e., the city of Reggio Calabria, along the trajectory shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The trip includes bus stops, and correspondingly, the position is not updated.</p><p>Edge facilities hosting the DT App have been emulated through an Asus laptop with CPU Intel Core i7-6500U, 12 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD.</p><p>The connectivity between the OBS and the ME host is emulated through a wired link and the tc Linux utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> has been used to reproduce different packet loss settings over such a link.</p><p>2) Software modules: For the case in which CoAP is selected as messaging protocol, our platform relies on Leshan 3 , the implementation in Java provided by the Eclipse foundation which allows to develop OMA LwM2M-compliant server and clients. Such implementation covers the majority of the OMA LwM2M specifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . It is based on the Californium CoAP implementation.</p><p>Measurements have been performed when the Nonconfirmable Message exchange and the Confirmable Message exchange options are considered.</p><p>For what concerns MQTT, we rely on Mosquitto <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which is an open-source implementation of the message broker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Metrics</head><p>The following metrics have been measured:</p><p>• Message delivery ratio: it is computed as the ratio between the number of messages successfully received at the DT side and the number of messages generated by the UE App during the trip. • Byte overhead: it is derived as the overall number of bytes transmitted by the involved entities, i.e., Leshan client/server or MQTT publisher/broker, over the number of actual bytes corresponding to the position data generated by the UE App (i.e., 57 bytes). The metric includes also TCP Acknowledgements in the case MQTT is considered. The metrics have been evaluated through the Wireshark 5 protocol analyzer.</p><p>Results averaged over 10 independent experimental runs are reported.   Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> reports the byte overhead metric. It can be observed that although providing the same reliability performance, the byte overhead incurred by CoAP with the Confirmable Message exchange is significantly lower than MQTT. This is due to the better formatting of OMA LwM2M w.r.t. MQTT. Indeed, the size of transmitted packets carrying the same information differs for the two protocols. We have 39 bytes for the payload of the CoAP Notification using the Type-Length-Value (TLV) format, and 58 bytes for the payload of MQTT Publish Message transmitted in hexadecimal format. Both sizes can vary of 1 byte according to the transmitted position.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Results</head><p>Besides the lower footprint in terms of exchanged bytes due to the usage of a binary format, the TLV format foreseen by OMA LwM2M has the additional advantage of facilitating the interpretation of conveyed fields by different stakeholders, hence natively ensuring higher interoperability. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS</head><p>In this paper we have presented a framework to track commuters' and PT vehicles' mobility. The proposal builds upon emerging IoT technologies for the collection, delivery, processing and presentation of mobility-related data to serve MaaS applications and services by other interested stakeholders. The implementation of a realistic PoC confirms the viability of the proposal and provides helpful insights about the effectiveness and efficiency of the candidate messaging protocols for the interactions of physical devices with the corresponding DTs.</p><p>Preliminary results about the computation footprint of the DT application (not shown in the paper) showcase it is negligible. Hence, as a future work we plan the deployment of the DT application as a Docker container, as well as the evaluation of its memory and CPU footprint when varying the available processing resources and the number of commuters for a given ME host to figure out potential scalability issues for the actual deployment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
