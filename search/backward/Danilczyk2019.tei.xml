<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ANGEL Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical System Security is a novel approach for improving the security of critical and non-critical infrastructure. Digital Twin technology, widely used in the aviation, manufacturing and automotive industries, has the potential to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the Digital Twin to the application of microgrid security. The Digital Twin is a real-time, physics-based simulation that runs alongside the physical system providing for its constant monitoring and control. The Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems, or ANGEL, will model both the cyber and physical layers of the microgrid and provide real-time data visualization. As a result, users will be aided in assessing the health of the physical plant and overall behavior over a range of operating conditions. The ANGEL Digital Twin will be able to use the real-time two-way coupling between the simulation and physical system to update and evolve the simulation to provide greater insight into the physical system. Ultimately ANGEL will provide the ability to diagnose and heal the physical system, mitigating both component failures and the effects of cyber attack. This paper will explain the methodology behind the design of this digital twin and the advantages of such an approach. To demonstrate the current capabilities of the ANGEL framework as a Level III digital twin, a simulation example is presented on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark.</p></div>

The development of smart devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created the opportunity to control Smart Grids in new ways. The Smart Grid will depend on a digital communication between the power utility in the Smart Meters, commonly referred to as advanced metering infrastructure. The Smart Grid will require passing immense amount of data from the distributed energy resources (DERs) to the control station requiring better data networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.

The duality of the power grid creates a unique challenge to protect and defend the grid from natural outages such as weather-related causes as well as cyber or physical attacks issued by malicious actors.

The potential power of a fully deployed digital twin provides exciting possibilities for improving the cyber physical security of the future grid as well as an avenue to visualize the response of the power grid when placed under duress.</p><p>This paper proposes the Automatic Network Guardian for 978-1-7281-0407-2/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE ELectrical systems (ANGEL) framework, which is an adaptation of state-of-the-art Digital Twin technology, to bridge the gap between simulation and control leading to a safer more secure power grid.

The proposed ANGEL framework, explained in Section III, represents a new approach to microgrid security using the data acquisition techniques already applied in legacy SCADA system. A case study using the ANGEL system is also presented in Section III. Sections IV presents a discussion of potential usage of the ANGEL digital twin for cyber defense.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. THE DIGITAL TWIN</head><p>A. What is a Digital Twin?</p><p>The digital twin was first imagined by Dr. Michael Grieves in his 2002 presentation for the formation of a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) center. Originally called the "Conceptual Ideal for PLM", this concept became the framework of the modern digital twin architecture. The definition put forth by Dr. Grieves was taken a step further to include "an integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of an as-built vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its corresponding flying twin" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. To accomplish this, the digital twin needs to expand beyond the traditional modeling and simulation techniques by incorporating sensor feedback in the simulation and feeding information from the simulation back into the physical model in real-time.</p><p>Recently, the term Digital Twin has become a buzzword in many industries often referring to a model, simulation or digital asset as a "Digital Twin". This often leads to confusion as to what exactly is a digital twin and necessitates a clear classification differentiating the sophistication of the digital twin in question. In his recent work, Madni proposes to categorize the maturity of a digital twin into four levels: Pre-Digital Twin, Digital Twin, Adaptive Digital Twin and Intelligent Digital Twin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The four levels of Digital Twin sophistication is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The Pre-Digital Twin encompasses all the design engineering tools that models the physical system without communication to the physical system. These tools are often used in the early stages of the design cycle before the construction of the physical system and are also commonly referred to as virtual prototypes. The next level of maturity is the Digital Twin. At this level, the digital twin is capable of communicating with the physical system in real-time. The digital twin collects data from the physical system and incorporates the data into the simulation. The third level of maturity is the Adaptive Digital Twin that is able to learn the preference and priorities of the human operators. This level is focused on creating a human interface that facilitates fast and accurate decision making by the system operator. The highest level of sophistication is the Intelligent Digital Twin which incorporates machine learning capabilities to discern patterns and make control decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. While, the full ANGEL Digital Twin Framework is to function as a Level IV Intelligent Digital Twin, the features that are currently implemented function as a Level III digital twin. The machine learning functionality is being developed and will be presented as future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Current Applications in Industry</head><p>The implementation of digital twins began in the aviation industry before rapidly expanding into manufacturing industries. More recently, the digital twin concept has been adopted by other industries that are focusing on the product lifecycle management (PLM) of consumer products such as the automotive industry, led by Tesla <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. General Electric and Siemens are also at the forefront of developing Digital Twin technologies for anything from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as wind farms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to cloud-based digital twin networks of multiple interconnected systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. A more limited, but still beneficial, application of the Digital Twin is monitoring the structural fatigue of loaded structures, such as aircraft or submarines, to assess structural integrity and predict potential failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Current Application in Power Systems</head><p>While digital twin technology is being adopted in numerous other industries, the energy sector has been slow to develop a digital twin for the power grid. The power grid continues to be modernized with devices that introduce small time constants, such as HVDC and FACTS, as well as, the phasor measurement units (PMUs) that are able to report measurements with a high temporal resolution. This has created a strain on the legacy SCADA system that cannot deal with the speed requirements of these high frequency elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. ANGEL DIGITAL TWIN FRAMEWORK</head><p>Power grid control centers have long relied on the legacy SCADA system to protect and control the power grid. However, the new Smart Grid that will be a fundamental building block for the future of Smart Cities could benefit from a more sophisticated system for control and security. The Automatic Network Guardian for Electrical (ANGEL) system has the ability to monitor the power system in real time and provide insight into the inner workings of the grid dynamics. This will allow a digital twin to direct the physical "twin" when abnormal grid behaviors are detected. The modern power grid is a perfect application for the digital twin technology. Using the legacy SCADA system that is already in place, the digital twin can access real-time data about the physical system and provide guidance in real-time. While early adaptations of the digital twin would likely include a human in the loop structure, the fully realized digital twin could potentially analyze and control the power system with virtually no human interaction.</p><p>Using the legacy communication techniques already found in the SCADA and wide area monitoring (WAM) systems, the ANGEL digital twin is able to attach itself to the control center environment and provide useful feedback. The physical microgrid and grid communication network feed data into the physics-based simulation, machine learning and data analysis, as well as the user interface and visualization suite of the digital twin, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. While analyzing additional data from the grid could be advantageous, using the legacy communication protocols will allow the digital twin to be deployed and tested on a microgrid without significant modifications.</p><p>The digital twin is required to effectively model both the physical and cyber layers of the Smart Grid. The ability to accurately model and simulate all aspects of the physical system is critical to being able to properly predict and assess the behavior of the Smart Grid. However, while doing this the simulations have to be fast enough to provide feedback to the Smart Grid in near real-time. The balance of fidelity and computational efficiency is essential to successfully executing a digital twin.</p><p>The physical twin surrogate runs in real-time using the pacing feature in Mathworks Simulink™. Alongside the real-time simulation, the digital twin simulation is run in a faster than real-time virtual environment. Since the digital twin simulation is able to run approximately five times faster than real time the ANGEL digital twin is able to compare the data from the physical and digital systems and flag any discrepancies.</p><p>As development of the ANGEL system continues, the power grid surrogate will be replaced with a state-of-theart hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation that will model not only the physical aspects, including the high frequency components, of the power grid but the cyber components as well. Phase 1 of this project has focused on the development of the ANGEL digital twin framework as well as the implementation of computationally efficient but accurate simulation techniques. Phases 2 and 3 will follow with the development of machine learning environment for the detection of cyber attacks and development of a performance analysis framework, respectively.</p><p>The digital twin uses a memory-based co-simulation method to pass data back and forth from the digital twin to the physical system. The co-simulation method of communication allows for the prototyping of the physics-based simulation methods and will be replaced with real power grid communication protocols, such as Modbus and IEC61850, when deployed on the hardware-in-the-loop system. Using this working prototype, we can evaluate the methodology by comparing the digital twin to the grid surrogate in the Matlab GUI environment.</p><p>The ANGEL digital twin is being developed to secure the modern cyber physical grid against these types of attacks and exploits. Using real-time, physics-based modeling and simulation techniques along with advanced stochastic methods, the ANGEL system will be able to not only identify a potential breach but evaluate the potential damage before it occurs. This will allow the system to adapt, creating a self-healing microgrid and ultimately similar systems could be applied to Smart Grids. The useful application of the self-healing aspects of the digital twin is not limited to malicious attacks. General degradation due to age or operating condition can also be mitigated using the same techniques.</p><p>Using parallel computing techniques, the digital twin is able to simulate many system states concurrently. Using these simulations, the digital twin is able to evaluate the current state of the physical twin against the simulations and make intelligent judgments of the physical system state. Combining the simulation technique along with machine learning algorithms could create a first line of defense that could potentially reduce grid vulnerabilities as well as lessen the time it takes for a system infiltration to be detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Case Study using ANGEL Digital Twin</head><p>While the ANGEL digital twin framework is for a Level IV Intelligent Digital Twin, the case study presented here is using the ANGEL system after completion of first phase of the development effort. This case study uses the IEEE 39-bus, commonly known as "the 10-machine New-England Power System", as the initial test case for the digital twin. First presented in 1970, the 39 Bus New England System is a simplified model of the high voltage transmission system in the northeast of the U.S.A. (New England area). It has since been often used for scientific research and publications. The 39 Bus New England System consists of 39 buses, 10 generators, 19 loads, 34 lines and 12 transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. The 39-bus benchmark (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) is commonly used in attack and defense scenarios due to its simplified nature and relatively small size and therefore minimal computational expense. The ANGEL GUI is fully interactive and can not only display the power grid topography, but it is also able to display pertinent data from the grid. These visualization techniques give the ANGEL system an ability to display any anomalies that are detected in the physical system. The user is able to select the desired grid element to inspect the network and meter data being returned from the physical system. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the user has selected a set of four buses, highlighted in blue, to inspect the bus characteristic data for each bus. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the user has selected the bus that encountered the fault, the Bus 39, as well as the two adjacent buses, Bus 1 and Bus 9, and a bus far removed from the fault, Bus 23. For each bus being inspected, data from the digital twin and the physical twin are able to be compared on a single screen, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, for the user to analyze. The ANGEL digital twin models both the physical and cyber layers of the Smart Grid. By modeling both layers the digital twin is able to evaluate the performance of the grid as well as validate the data it is receiving from the power system. In the event a grid anomaly is detected the Angel system will direct the physical system to a stable condition while also identifying the potential cause of the anomaly.</p><p>The ANGEL digital twin GUI, shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4, 5 and 6</ref>, is developed using the Mathwork MATLAB App Designer and Mathworks Simulink™ SimPowerSystems as a surrogate for the power grid for the ANGEL prototype. The ANGEL GUI runs alongside the benchmark system and extracts meaningful data from the simulation model. The ANGEL system will take this data and displays the current state of the physical system as well as feed the data into the digital twin simulation. This structure will allow future expansion the capabilities of the ANGEL system to a full hardware-in-the-loop simulation and eventually a full microgrid without requiring too much modification. To show ANGEL in action, a simple demo case was set up to create a discrepancy between the physical system and the digital twin. Similar to the methodology used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a threephase fault is implemented on bus 39 in the physical twin at the 10 second mark and the fault is cleared at 10.2 seconds.</p><p>An important part of the digital twin is the ability to visualize the data acquired from physical and digital twins. The visualization is aimed to inform the operator of the condition of the physical system and how well it is aligning with the digital twin. The digital twin and physical twin align quite well for this demo case up, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> until the 10s mark when the fault is triggered. This is to be expected because both systems are running in nearly identical environments without any perturbations.</p><p>At the 10s mark the three-phase fault is triggered on bus 39 and the impact of his fault reverberates throughout the system. As one would expect the response is most severe on bus 39 which is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>. The ANGEL digital twin is able to capture the differences between the digital twin simulation which does not have the fault and the physical twin which has a three-phase fault at bus 39. When this divergence occurs, the angel GUI detects the discrepancy and alerts the user of the potential issue. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. USING A DIGITAL TWIN FOR CYBER DEFENSE</head><p>The ability of the digital twin to not only model, but to influence the physical system creates an extremely powerful entity that could defend the grid against cyber-attack and exploit. The hybrid approach of the digital twin makes it very well suited to evaluate the performance of the full power grid and make decisions to protect the stability of the grid in real time. While digital twins are not currently used in modern power system monitoring and control, similar concepts have become part of the discussion in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. False Data Injection</head><p>The false data injection attack is the most obvious potential vulnerability to the digital twin for Smart Grids. The digital twin is an integral part of the Smart Grid that it is installed on. This tight two-way coupling makes it extremely vulnerable to reacting to bad data. However, the physics-based simulation that is the basis of the digital twin will make it more difficult for the attacker to inject data that still aligns with a probable real-world solution. The simulation approach has built-in redundancy due to the entire system being modeled not just an individual node.</p><p>While false data injection attacks have proven successful against state estimation techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the physics-based simulation environment of the digital twin increases the difficulty of such attacks. Signal data that does not align with the simulation-based system state will be flagged and evaluated to determine the source of the error. Using this type of approach, the Digital Twin can add layers of protection to the traditional SCADA system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Denial-of-Service</head><p>The Digital Twin relies on a constant stream of data to keep the simulation model in lock-step with the physical twin. If the data received by the Digital Twin is cut off or delayed the Digital Twin would not be effective in directing the physical system because any control or guidance the physical twin receives from the digital twin will no longer be present. In this case, the physical system would default to the traditional SCADA system. Likewise, the temporal accuracy of the sensor information is important to the digital twin. If the sensor information is delayed in a way that puts the digital twin out of sync with the physical Smart Grid, the input provided by the digital twin could excite any grid instabilities that are present in the physical system. Due to the importance of the temporal component in digital twin's dynamic simulation, the timestamp of the data would also need to be analyzed in conjunction with the physical parameters of the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Topology Attack</head><p>The topology attack is a man-in-the middle attack where the attacker is able to intercept network and meter data, modify them and forward the modified data packets onto the control system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. While modern power systems have bad data tests to compare the network and meter data, if both data set are changed to be consistent the data check will not discover the change. Further, this type of attack can be shown to be impossible for the traditional SCADA system to detect without proper countermeasures in place <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. One of the countermeasures suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> is to lock down certain meters to prevent tampering with the meter data. While this method would likely work, it could possibly be difficult to lock down a meter with absolute certainty.</p><p>The digital twin presents another possible solution to the defense of this attack. By providing an independent real-time simulation of the full topology of the physical system, the digital twin will be able to detect any unnatural changes in the data that the digital twin receives from the physical twin. Furthermore, the digital twin will be able to evaluate the likelihood of the recorded meter and network data being accurate or bad data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Digital Twin Vulnerability to Attack</head><p>The addition of more elements to any system creates a potential vulnerability for attack and the digital twin is no different. The ANGEL framework attempts to mitigate the inherent risks involved with a powerful system by designing the digital twin with the capability to fall back on the SCADA system if required. However, this is not enough to prevent the digital twin from becoming a potential single point of failure for the system is installed on. It is imperative that the ANGEL framework be designed with this vulnerability in mind and the ability to detect and self-diagnose is critically important.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>The ANGEL system is able to demonstrate its ability to gather system data and to present anomalies to the operator. Gathering this anomaly data is the first step to implementing a machine learning algorithm that can characterize the data set to make intelligent decisions using an AI framework. Once equipped with AI decision-making, the ANGEL Intelligent Digital Twin will create a learning and self-healing system is the fully developed digital twin that we believe is needed to defend the power grid. The ANGEL framework will allow for the implementation of more sophisticated defense of the power grid using real-time response and damage mitigation.</p><p>While the prior sections outline the potential applications of the ANGEL system, the development of the ANGEL Digital Twin for Microgrid Security is currently ongoing. The opening of the new URI Cyber Physical Security lab will provide us with the opportunity to use state-of-the-art hardware-in-theloop based simulation as the microgrid surrogate. This will also allow the ANGEL framework to transition to using the SCADA communication network for as a data delivery system rather than the current co-simulation memory-based approach. This will enable the ANGEL framework to test the system in attack and defense scenarios on both the cyber and physical layers with minimal modification required to the traditional power grid testbeds.</p><p>While the power of the digital twin is beginning to be realized in other industries, the power distribution sector has been relatively slow to develop digital twin technology. As Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies continue to infiltrate themselves into all industries, the potential applications and power of digital twins continue to increase. Creating digital twins of individual devices or components to determine maintenance cycles and service life is valuable; however, the ability to leverage the digital twin to not only model the full physical system but also to control, adapt and protect the physical system would be extremely beneficial.</p><p>The ANGEL digital twin for Cyber Physical System Security of microgrids can be a game-changer in the defense of distributed energy resources. The ability to monitor, evaluate and control remote assets using physics-based simulations and machine learning algorithms is the next step in smart control systems. The legacy SCADA system would still be valuable and can be used as a safety net to prevent malicious actors from targeting the digital twin virtual environment as a single point of failure. The digital twin will create a framework for a learning and self-healing cyber physical system that is able to combat the sophisticated malicious cyber attacks that are being implemented worldwide. The power grid is perhaps the most essential piece of modern infrastructure and therefore protecting it is critical.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
