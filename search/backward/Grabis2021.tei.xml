<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Digital service security and resilience is an active research area <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Despite the fact that digital services are delivered jointly by networks of organizations, security and resilience are often addressed within organizational boundaries, or even boundaries of a specific service or information system. However, the magnitude and sophistication of the challenges faced by modern organizations can only be addressed if the organizational ecosystem is considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Every node of the network contributes to both strengths and weaknesses of the network and its services. Hence, it is a common practice for malicious actors to target the nodes having lax security practices or limited resilience, including organization's business partners, customer, contractors, and suppliers.</p><p>There are many examples of vulnerabilities in networked organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, 40 million of Target's credit card data were stolen by exploring security in shortcoming in HVAC devices used at the stores and provided by an external vendor. Similarly, 40,000 U.K. users were affected by a data leak in a third party customer chatbot. Experts predict that these problems will be amplified by a rush to create new devices and services relying on the 5G mobile network <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which would open doors for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities. This paper argues that the digital services provisioning network as a whole as well as individual nodes should possess security and resilience capabilities to ensure safe and sustainable delivery of the services. In this regard, capability is seen as an ability and capacity to meet desired goals (including security and privacy requirements) in dynamic context <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The security and resilience capabilities jointly allow for a quick recovery in the case of security incidents.</p><p>The capabilities are developed following the Capability Driven Development (CDD) methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. CDD defines capability design, delivery, and knowledge accumulation processes. These three activities are integrated in such a way that allows the company to capture contextual information in relation to capability objectives and to adapt capability delivery according to changes in the context and performance. CDD is suitable for design of secure and resilient systems because the concerns of context adherence and performance improvement are addressed at the organizational and inter-organizational level rather than just the technical level. CDD is a component-oriented methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and extensions can be developed for specific purposes.</p><p>The objective of the paper is to elaborate a method extension of the CDD methodology for development of security and resilience capabilities. The method extension is specifically targeted towards networked organizations. It includes inspection of the capability design to identify security and resilience concerns using both expert judgment and capability patterns. The method also considers using a data-driven digital twin for continuous exploration and prediction of newly arising threats. The digital twin uses live data to evaluate the current situation and to appraise suitable response mechanisms. The paper extends the previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> on resilience of ICT product supply chains by generalizing the capability-based resilience management to different types of networked organizations.</p><p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses foundations of the proposed method extension. Section 3 describes the component of the digital twin, focal for enabling security analysis in the network. The method extension is elaborated in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 present two application examples. The related work is reviewed in Section 7. Section 8 discusses the contribution as well as provides concluding remarks and outlines issues for future work. capability is designed for delivery in a specific context as defined using context elements. The context elements name factors affecting the capability delivery. The context elements take value from a context range and jointly define a context set (not shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>) describing the area of capability suitability. The process element specifies a capability delivery solution. The capability model does not model the whole delivery solution but only focuses on features that are context dependent and adaptive. The delivery solution is designed and implemented following the organization and platform specific engineering process.</p><p>In order to ensure that a capability is delivered as expected in different contextual situations, adjustments are used to adapt its delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The adjustments take context data and KPIs as input and evaluate potential changes in the capability delivery. They are also used to implement complex context-dependent decision-making logics. The capability designs are aimed to be reusable across organizations. The reusable components are represented by patterns. The patterns provide solutions to capability design and delivery problems observed in similar contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1. Key elements of the CDD meta-model</head><p>The process of capability development is performed according to the CDD methodology. Its main features are: • Enterprise Modelling phase, which defines information about the digital enterprise necessary to specify requirements for development of capable information systems. It allows involving business people in information system development; • Design phase, where the capability-enabled information system is designed on the basis of the existing knowledge in a model-driven manner; • Delivery phase, where the information system is executed, monitored, and adjusted to changes in the operating environment if necessary; • Feedback phase, where the information system delivery experiences are accumulated and changes in the design are requested. The capability model is developed during the design phases. The model is used to configure the capability delivery solution. The adjustments are also implemented during the design phase. The CDD methodology focuses on development of adaptable components of the overall capability deliverer solution. Development of other components needs to be done with other engineering methods and tools specific for the problem domain and business case. The delivery phase concerns run-time aspects. The main aspect of capability delivery is the execution of capability delivery adjustments. The adjustments are executed in separate container and interact with the other parts of the capability delivery solution through well-defined interfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Method Extensions</head><p>CDD consists of a number of method components each focusing on a specific task of the capability cycle, such as Capability Design, Context Modeling, Patterns and Variability Modeling, and Capability Adjustment Algorithm Specification. These method components are considered to comprise the regular CDD method. It can be extended with method extensions for dealing with certain business challenges such as supporting business process outsourcing, context-aware configuration of e-government services, industrial symbiosis, designing of new entrepreneurial ventures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, as well as managing service configuration with the support of open data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Method components and method extensions are described following the structure of a method component initially outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Forms of cooperation</head><p>The benefits of structuring a method in method components are: (i) the resulting method is not a monolith, which means that its parts can be combined and applied depending on the needs of the modeling domain; (ii) all components are based on a common meta-model, which allows efficient elaboration of new components and extensions, (iii) the method components or their parts can be easily updated and replaced, e.g. the goal modeling language of CDD is based on 4EM and can be replaced with another; (iv) the method can be extended with other methods offering modelling perspectives that are not currently addressed by it. With respect to the latter, this paper presents parts of the results of research project ARTSS among the objectives of which is to elaborate an extension of the CDD methodology for modeling secure and resilient business service ecosystems in crisis and post-crisis situations. To this end, the existing CDD method components will be interfaced with additional method extensions addressing capability design and management of (a) secure foundational IT services, (b) secure telemedicine services, (c) secure remote workplaces, (d) secure business services. In order to elaborate the envisioned method extensions additional three services should also be elaborated (e) specification of capability-enabled digital twins, (f) advanced context data processing for live data streams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Resilience Design Method</head><p>The secure and resilient capability design method consists of a set of concepts supplementing the existing CDD meta-model and the design procedure. The purpose of the method extension is to ensure that capability design and delivery includes concerns for security and resilience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Concepts</head><p>The core building blocks of the secure and resilient capability design method are (1) the principle of joint responsibility of members of service provision network to deliver secure and resilient services, (2) the notion of capability for configuring the supply chains with goal and context awareness, (3) the need to develop and manage digital twins to simulate and predict the behavior of the supply chain from the data of executing capabilities, and (4) a collaboration-based approach to the reconfiguration and adjustment of supply chains to ensure the needed security and optimal trust. In this regard, capability defines an ability and capacity of the network and its nodes to provide secure and resilient services. The network has common goals, exchange contextual information as well as shares knowledge to a degree of trust required in the network. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref> illustrates additional concepts introduced in the CDD meta-model to design secure and resilient service delivery capabilities. The network is required to possess security and resilience capabilities. Delivery of these capabilities is supported by services (used as an alternative implementation mechanism to processes in the original CDD meta-model). These services are provided by a network consisting of multiple nodes. The concept of security concern is introduced to identify goals dealing with security and resilience. In order to explore network behavior depending on contextual changes and adjustments used, its virtual representation or digital twin is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. It uses live data to diagnose potential problems and to plan capability delivery. It plans the application of adjustments to optimize capability delivery according to the specified goals. The digital twin uses the actual network services in its simulations. It is not aimed to represent the whole network and its services. The digital twin focuses on the security concerns identified during the capability design. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Procedure</head><p>The capability design is an iterative and interactive processes. There are several pathways to design the capability and the modeling procedure defines the suggested modeling steps but not necessarily a fixed sequence of their execution. The following steps are performed to design a resilient capability: 1.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> what includes identification of the capability's goals and delivery context as well as KPIs and measurable properties used to measure the goals and context, respectively. The capability is implemented using a set of services.</p><p>The capability design is inspected for the purpose if identifying security and resilience concerns. At first the pattern repository is searched to identify the concerns associated with the capability design. The search is performed by matching goals, context, and services included in the capability design with those referenced in the pattern repository and associated with the security and resilience domain. The design is also inspected by experts who identify other security and resilience concerns. The security and resilience concerns identified are marked as properties of the elements of the capability design and goals, context, and services in particular. Adjustments are used to address the security and resilience concerns. They are selected from the pattern repository or specified by the domain experts. Context values or their ranges as well as KPI thresholds triggering the adjustments are also specified.</p><p>The adjustments change the capability delivery in response to changes in the context or performance. In order to appraise these changes in a virtual environment, a digital twin is developed to represent certain aspects of the capability delivery. The capability design is inspected to mark aspects of capability delivery requiring representation using a digital twin; these aspects are referred as to twinning concerns.</p><p>The digital twin is developed to represent the twinning concerns identified. It used live data and contextual information to suggest a suitable resilience response (i.e., triggering of appropriate adjustments). The capability delivery dashboard is used to continuously monitor the capability delivery performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Data-driven Digital Twin</head><p>A data-driven digital twin is a digital representation of a service provisioning network on the basis of live data streams for the purpose of analysis of security concerns and experimentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). The network is only partially observable and there is a degree of uncertainty and missing data in its representation. Therefore, it is referred as to datadriven because of relaxed requirements in terms of knowing the internal structure of the network. The digital twin receives data about a live network as specified in the capability model. The data streams are analyzed to identify irregularities and to benchmark them against the normal behavior captured in the patterns. The digital twin is then used to predict the behavior of the network and to propose adjustments to cope with security concerns and to adjust the network. The digital twin is based on a model representing the network. Various types of models including simulation, statistical, and machine learning could be used. The Design-of-experiments (DOE) module is used to specify scenarios to be explored to identify weaknesses and potential threats. The Simulator module is responsible for exploring the scenarios. The evaluation scenarios are visualized and the prediction results are transferred to the portal and the dashboard. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Secure Campus Area Network Governance Example</head><p>A campus area network (CAN) consists of multiple interconnected local area networks (LAN) in a limited geographical area. It is often characterized by a combination of different modes of management including access and security control. The example explores the case of CAN governance at a large higher education institution <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that operates a CAN. The network is highly heterogeneous consisting of multiple LANs with different security settings and governance modes. One part of the network is governed by a centralized network management system while other parts are not. There is a variety of devices connecting to the network including private computers and specialized devices. Moreover, there are locations and situations permitting access without authentication. As a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, studies are taking place online and employees work remotely, which puts strains on network performance and creates additional security risk exposures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Capability Model</head><p>In order to ensure continuous operations of the higher education institution, the Secure campus network governance capability is deployed. Following the CDD methodology, a capability model is developed (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The capability fulfills goal 3.1 To provide secure IT environment supported by the goals 3.4 To provide high connectivity and 3.2 To prevent security incidents. Goal 3.4 specifically targets the ability of all users to access network, especially, during live events. Goal 3.2 concerns security. The top goal 3.1 is also supported by the goal 3.3 To minimize warnings by CERT, an external network security monitoring organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurable properties</head><p>The capability delivery is affected by relevant context elements. The Device threat level indicates whether a network connected device is potentially infected; it is evaluated using multiple measurable properties. This evaluation might not always be 100% accurate because of obfuscation. The user threat level depends on availability of the user identity information and user's previously recorded behavior. The Urgency context element characterizes the need to resolve security incidents as quickly as possible. It is assumed that the urgency increases if there are many active users and external data indicates intensification of security incidents. The context elements are evaluated using the specified measurable properties. It is important to note that these are the elements considered by the institution of this case; other institutions might design the capability differently and choose context elements according to their needs. The capability is implemented using two primary services, namely, the Malicious activity identification service and the Incident resolution. The former uses a number of techniques to identify infected nodes in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the latter provides various means for informing users on activities required to resolve the incident.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 5. The initial Secure campus area network governance capability design</head><p>In order to identify means for ensuring security and resilience, the capability model is further refined (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Potential values of the context elements are identified and context ranges are specified. These values guide the capability delivery in response to changes in the context. They are defined as categorical variables and the categories are defined by the modelers and using data analysis. The Device threat level assumes values {None, Possible Low, Possible High, Definite low, Definite high}. The low values indicate that a threat identified does not create an immediate harm while the high values suggest that the node could affect the whole network. The latter case requires an immediate action to resolve the incident. The possible values suggest detection of suspicious activities though they cannot be classified as malicious. The definite values indicate that the node is certainly infected. The Urgency has categories {Low, Medium, High}. The high level is assigned if there are many active nodes during crucial operation hours. The User threat level is determined according to the previously observed behavior of the respective user and it is set to Unknown if the user cannot be identified. Adjustments to adapt the capability are identified. The Select response adjustment determines, which options provided by the Incident resolution service should be invoked depending on the context and KPI. In this case two types of responses could be used: (1) notify user; and</p><p>(2) disconnect device. These responses are treated as sub-capabilities because the institution should possess abilities to carry out the response mechanisms and they are potentially reusable for other organizations.</p><p>The Select response adjustment invokes either the Notify user capability or the Disconnect device capability (1.1 and 1.2 respectively). The decision is made according to a decision-table specifying the selection outcome according to the context values. The Disconnect device capability is deployed if User threat level is Unknown and Urgency is Low or Medium because disconnecting one node could affect other nodes urgently requiring the network. The Notify user capability uses the Select notification type adjustment, which select among posting a message into user profile, sending an e-mail message or sending and SMS message. The latter has been observed as the most efficient notification type (i.e., user response time is the shortest) though it is also the most intrusive and its over-usage could decrease it efficiency. Therefore, it is preserved for cases when either of the context elements have value High. Selection of suitable response and notification means directly affects resilience of the system in terms of its ability to respond to security incidents and to ensure that ongoing network operations are uninterrupted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 6. The Secure campus area network governance capability and its sub-capabilities</head><p>The Urgency update adjustment is also introduced (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). This adjustment dynamically changes classification of the incidents according to their urgency. If there are too many incidents and their resolution time is too long then more incidents are classified as urgent requiring efficient resolution mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 7. The Urgency update adjustment</head><p>In order to identify the need for urgent update and to determine classification changes required, a digital twin of the CAN is created specifically to explore the Incident resolution service (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The digital twin uses live data from the CAN. That includes the evaluated device threat level and urgency as well as the observed number of incidents. The DOE specifies several alternative ways to define the urgency level. In order to evaluate these alternatives, a model representing the CAN and its Incident resolution service is constructed. The live data are fed into the model and simulated for a specific planning horizon. The model uses actual network governance services to discover incidents and to select response mechanisms. As the results, it presents the expected number of incidents depending on the way the urgency level is defined. It is important to note that the digital twin is constructed to represent specific aspects of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 8. Incident resolution digital twin</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Incident Resolution</head><p>To demonstrate the Urgency update adjustment, an example is elaborated. It evaluates alternative ways to evaluate the Urgency context element as follows: 1. The Urgency is set to High for most of the incidents (U1); 2. The Urgency levels are uniformly distributed (U2); 3. The Urgency is set to Low for most of the incidents (U3); A network fragment of 1000 nodes is simulated over a fixed time period:</p><p>1. Start with the first period; 2. Infection of a fraction of the nodes is simulated; 3. The Malicious activity identification service is used to discover the infection.</p><p>It can be discovered immediately or in one of the forthcoming time periods. 4. The infected node can infect a random number of other nodes as long as the incident is not resolved. 5. If the incident is discovered, the Select response adjustment is invoked to determine the response type; 6. Application of the response mechanism is represented as simulated time needed to resolve the incident; 7. The expected value of the Number of incidents KPI is evaluated; 8. The process is repeated from Step 2 till the end of the planning horizon. The simulated evaluation is performed for all three alternatives. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">9</ref> shows the incident resolution duration depending on the urgency evaluation policy. Consequently, if many incidents are classified as urgent and the SMS notification is used, the resolution speed increases. These results can be compared with the desired value of KPI. If KPI value is satisfactory then the capability can be adapted to use a more conservative classification (i.e., prefer the U3 policy). However, if the KPI value is not satisfactory, the U1 policy should be invoked. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Secure Supplier Onboarding Example</head><p>The example case considers an ICT product called IoTool (https://iotool.io/), which is a lightweight IoT gateway. The IoTool uses various third-party components such as sensors and actuators supplied by different vendors. The tool vendor needs to make sure that the components are trusted and do not compromise IoTool end-users. Currently, the IoTool design implements fair-enough security, but needs to face the interoperation with additional untrustworthy IoT devices and protocols which usually are black-boxes in the sense that they offer little information with regard to what security and privacy protections they implement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Capability Model</head><p>The IoTool solution uses out-of-the-box devices (e.g. smartphones) which are not 100% secure and users want to use them for different purposes. It is necessary to make sure that data transport protocol is secured to keep data integrity and confidentiality. By adopting the capability-based approach, the IoTool requires that vendors of the connected devices provide the secure sensing capability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">10</ref>). The goals of secure sensing capability are goal 2 To preserve data privacy and goal 3 to prevent using sensing devices for DOS or similar malicious activities, as well as goals 5 to provide the desired features requested by customers. Additionally, the overall supply chain risk level should not exceed a pre-specified threshold (goals 4). To ensure that the ICT product supply chain is able to achieve these goals, context is defined in terms of to how the vendors and devices are characterized by their trustworthiness and vulnerabilities. Measurable properties are used to evaluate the context. Both internal and external data sources are used. It is assumed that the trustworthiness score is evaluated using data (i.e., measurable properties) provided from a credit scoring agency (e.g., https://www.companyhouse.de/) and the product vulnerability score is evaluated using data from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database (https://cve.mitre.org/). The Product vulnerabilities assume values from the range 1…10 with categorical ratings from None to Critical.</p></div>

Secure sensing capability model</head><p>The ICT product supply chain topology including its product design and supply chain configuration is developed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">11</ref>).

Once the IT environment supporting the digital twin for the supply chain is put in place the context is continuously evaluated on the basis of the measurable property data and if irregularities are observed the supply chain is reconfigured. For example, in case external data sources provide a report that one of the vendors has supplied insecure sensors and the Vendor trustworthiness falls below a certain threshold set by the IoTool vendor, the sensors provided by this supplier are excluded from the offering. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Suppliers Selection</head><p>The ICT supply chain is continuously monitored for security concerns. The digital twin employs various models to represent and to analyze the supply chain. A data-driven supply chain configuration model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is one of these models. It uses the current data to evaluate the agreement of the established supply chain typology with the goals defined for the capability. In the sample model provided, the supply chain risk minimization is considered. The model selects supply chain members (referenced using index j) and products (references using index i) to minimize the overall supply chain level of risk R (Eq. 1). The risk is calculated by taking into account the context factors, namely, the product vulnerability score ai and the supply chain member trustworthiness score bj. The parameters wi indicate the relative importance of the product item in the ICT product and ij is 1 if the ith product is provided by the jth supply chain member and 0 otherwise. The decision variable Xij is 1 if the ith product provided by the jth supply chain member is included in the ICT product supply chain and 0 otherwise.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">11 min MN i i j ij ij ij R w a b X  == =→  (1)</formula><p>Eq. 2 requires the minimum set of features for the ICT product stating that a function f of the selected products should be larger than a specified threshold F.</p><p>( )</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">fF  X (2)</formula><p>Furthermore, any selected supply chain member is required to possess the secure sensing capability, represented by constraints in Eq. 3-5.

Therefore, a round of supply chain configuration model execution should be triggered and recommendations for supply chain reconfiguration should be generated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Design of networks providing digital services is a challenging research area <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Security concerns are particularly prevalent in such networks often due to their obscure nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Specialized modeling methods help to identify and highlight the security concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Security Incident Response Modelling Language is proposed to model security and recovery issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Various aspects of designing secure systems can be captured using a unified modeling technique representing attack trees, vulnerability cause graphs, security activity graphs, and security goal indicator trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Insufficient transparency in networks also can be addressed by means of data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, resilience should be a measurable feature of network design <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Considering design of resilient systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> suggestes starting from a goal-framework for achieving: diversity (variety of actors), efficiency (productivity and resource utilization), adaptability (transparency and flexibility), and cohesion (alignment of actors and their capabilities), which then need to be realized by the goals and objectives specific to a business domain. ISO 22316:2017 provides a guideline for any size or type of organization. It is not specific to any industry or sector and it can be applied throughout the life of an organization. MITRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> has outlined a set of "design principles" for cyber resilience elicited from various domains including evolvability, survivability and security. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides a framework for improving the cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructures. Some research studies have proposed guidelines for organizational cyber resilience and measuring its maturity by extending the design of the information systems with, for example, additional interfaces to the systems' environment for increased situational awareness, design of alternative, modular software capabilities, development of security-related parameters and related metrics, and rich testing to different conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Haque et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> present a comprehensive cyber resilience framework for Industrial Control Systems by decomposing "resilience" into a hierarchy of several sub-metrics. Their resilience framework can serve as a platform for a multi-criteria decision aid and help technical experts in identifying the gap in the study of network resilience.</p><p>The concept of digital twins is starting to get attention for application in the security management domain. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> propose to use digital twins to rise cyber situational awareness for cyber-physical systems through visualizations. Viability of using data streams in digital twining has been recently demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. In advanced cases such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, digital models of service networks are created automatically by analyzing large sets of data available in the existing enterprise information systems. This paper has presented a method extension of the CDD methodology for design and delivery of secure and resilient capabilities. The CDD methodology is used as a basis for this development because it allows to consider security and resilience concerns from both organizational and technical perspectives. The capability delivery is supported by digital services, which are provided by a network of organizations. It is shown that the network level resilience can be achieved if individual nodes are able to meet security and resilience goals and to share contextual and performance information. The datadriven digital twin is a primary tool to ensure resilience. It is used to evaluate the current capability delivery situation as well as to suggest the necessary adjustments in response to contextual changes and performance goals.</p><p>The digital twin component is introduced in the paper. However, the digital twin development process is still highly case specific. Formalization of the digital twin development and exploration processes in an area for future research. It should also be considered in relation to knowledge reuse in the form of patterns as suggested by the CDD methodology. The CDD methodology is also supported by a toolset supporting capability design, delivery, and knowledge management. However, support for digital twin development of operation is currently not supported by this toolset and digital twins are developed for a specific purpose using they own technology stack. Integration between tools used in the CDD methodology and digital twin development technologies is also subject to further investigation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3.
