  abstract  = {The advancements in the field of internet of things, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics has laid the path to the evolution of digital twin technology. The digital twin is a high-fidelity digital model of a physical system or asset that can be used e.g. to optimize operations and predict faults of the physical system. To understand different use cases of digital twin and its potential for cybersecurity incident prediction, we have performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). In this paper, we summarize the definition of digital twin and state-of-the-art on the development of digital twin including reported work on the usability of a digital twin for cybersecurity. Existing tools and technologies for developing digital twin is discussed.},

  abstract  = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

Usually, only one or two devices are given to the testers, but hundreds or thousands are needed to really test IoT effects. This proposition makes IoT Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) cost and management prohibitive. One possible approach is to develop a digital twin of the IoT device and employ many replicas of the twin in a simulation environment comprised of various simulators that mimic the IoT device's operational environment. Cyber attack experimentation is a critical aspect of IoT T&amp;E and without such a virtual T&amp;E environment, it is almost impossible to study large scale effects. This paper will present a digital twin engineering methodology as applicable to IoT device T&amp;E and cyber experimentation.},

The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

Therefore, the aggregated and contextualized data is bundled in a central data hub, bringing tremendous cybersecurity advantages. Given the threat landscape in IIoT systems, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to be prepared regarding their cybersecurity, react quickly, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity. For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures. Thus, this paper conceptualizes a flexible security analytics service that implements security capabilities with flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs' needs. The security analytics service is also evaluated with a real-world use case.},

Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.},

Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem.
