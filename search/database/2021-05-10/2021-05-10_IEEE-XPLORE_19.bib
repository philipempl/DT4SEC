  abstract  = {Attention to cyber security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has led to the development of innovative cyber-resilient methodologies to ensure early detection and mitigation of cyber anomalies and threats. The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.},

Many existing digital-twins stream read-only data of machine sensors and do not incorporate operations of manufacturing machines through Internet. In this paper, a new method of virtualization is proposed to integrate machining data and operations into the digital-twins using Internet scale machine tool communication method. A fully functional digital-twin is implemented in CPMC testbed using MTComm and several manufacturing application scenarios are developed to evaluate the proposed method and system. Performance analysis shows that it is capable of providing data-driven visual monitoring of a manufacturing process and performing manufacturing operations through digital twins over the Internet. Results of the experiments also shows that the MTComm based digital twins have an excellent efficiency.},

The unpredictable network dynamics of aerial-assisted IoV pose challenges to the resource allocation. In this paper, dynamic digital twin (DT) of aerial-assisted IoV is established to capture the time-varying resource supply and demands, so that unified resource scheduling and allocation can be performed. We design a two-stage incentive mechanism for resource allocation based on Stackelberg game where DT of vehicles or road side units (RSUs) is deemed as the leader, and the RSUs who provide computing services are as the follower. In the first stage incentive, we determine the computing resources that RSUs are willing to offer according to vehicles’ preferences. To further maximize the satisfaction of vehicles and the overall energy efficiency, a distributed incentive mechanism based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is then designed, in which the resource allocation policy for each vehicle is optimized. Thanks to ADMM, the incentive mechanism can be run at multiple RSUs in parallel to reduce delay and relieve the computational burden of UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the satisfaction of vehicles and the energy efficiency at the same time.},

Answering the demands of critical IoT (Internet of Things), and mass IoT application users - beside lifting mobile broadband to the next level - remains the challenge for 5G. While generic, high level targets for KPIs are widely communicated, it is not yet well-understood how the various demands can affect the traffic mixture. Both the radio- and the core-domains of the cellular network have to cope with traffic peaks, and have to obey various QoS (Quality of Service) guarantees. In order to do this, traffic-related characteristics should be determined, and this knowledge should be used during network planning, optimization and service shaping.This paper aims to provide insights to user behavioral patterns for these three key application areas: mobile broadband, critical IoT and mass IoT. Since traffic volume- and burst-related user behaviour is not expected to change suddenly, current, targeted data collection on 4G links would provide a good basic insight for future, 5G usage - at least as traffic patterns. We collected live 4G network data then analyzed throughout this paper in order to show traffic patterns - and their distinguishing features - for the three key 5G application areas.},

  abstract = {With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.},

The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.},

Traditional frameworks work in small, single manager environments, but are impractical in even medium sized, complex, or distributed multi- manager environments such as smart homes, smart buildings, and smart cities. Our framework is built upon the Liberated Object Location System (LOLS) that provides a distributed, decentralized, secure, and consumer oriented system that merges a control management framework for data collection and analysis with the consumers and the smart elements in the environment. Digital twins, or proxy services, are created for each device. LOLS provides a directory service for each device and its digital twin, allowing consumers to interact with the connected devices in the environment either directly or through the digital twin. Digital twins may exist at multiple levels in the information hierarchy, allowing for localized, regional, or even global functional scope. All digital twins are integrated with the environment control and management functionality, allowing for scalable, distributed smart environments that provide a consumer accessible interface for each smart device.},
