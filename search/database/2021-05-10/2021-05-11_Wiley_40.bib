While these systems afford greater functionality, they also create a heightened security risk due to their network-enabled capabilities, their reliance on software, and their direct interaction with physical systems. This chapter will provide a user perspective on the challenges in securing these systems, based on known vulnerabilities and attacks against CPS. It will also outline challenges and opportunities for the use of modeling and simulation in supporting improved security systems engineering of these systems.},

  abstract  = {Summary Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are hybrid systems comprising multiple components and many other combinations of various integrated but heterogeneous computational and physical capabilities. Todays embedded system such as iPhones and smart watches have integrated hardware and software solutions. There are engineering methodologies available to develop such embedded systems, focusing on the system. While their use at a personal level is much understood, what is less understood, and a topic of ongoing research is the question of what happens when such systems are deployed across multiple sectors, such as intelligent transportation systems, Internet of Things, smart medical devices, and many more, and used in activities not originally intended by the designers, for example, controlling the physical devices such as an automobile or an electricity power generation plant. This cross-sector deployment and the collective use of such systems introduces risk at the macro-system level that may have cascaded impacts in a highly networked environment, which further impact the constituent systems themselves. This is a major problem. One possibility to reduce the technical risk is to remotely control the systems in the cyber environments, but the sheer number of variables and possible situations introduce complexity at multiple scales. This complexity results in test plans with limited coverage. Additional cyber physical system related issues of intelligence, adaptation, autonomy, and security make the problem even worse. The proposed solution is the enhanced use of Modeling and Simulation (M\&S). The M\&S discipline has supported the development of complex systems since its inception. This chapter provides an overview on the M\&S methods and technologies that aid CPS engineering in the development and testing phases, and CPS governance when they are deployed in complex cyber environments.},

Companies are migrating to a more digital model based fundamentally on three pillars: communications, big data and artificial intelligence. The right combination of these three pillars will optimise the operation of the electrical system, reducing costs and polluting emissions, accelerating the adoption of non-polluting energies and renewable energies, while maximising economic performance and a closer way of interacting with users.

Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.},

The reader may ponder about the amorphous questions or wonder in confusion. We disrupt the status quo and indulge in orthogonal, nonlinear, and asymmetric information arbitrage which may not be correct. This is a seed, sterile unless cultivated. We aspire to inform that tools and data related to the affluent world are not a template to be “copied” or applied to systems in the remaining (80\%) parts of the world which suffer from economic constraints. We need different thinking that resists the inclination of the affluent 20\% of the world to treat the rest of the world (80\% of the population) as a market. The 80/20 concept evokes the Pareto [1] theme in P3 and the implication is that ideas may float between (porous) the 80/20 domains (partition).},

In such systems, it is mandatory to monitor the field network and detect potential threats before a problem occurs. This work proposes a hybrid approach that orchestrates unsupervised and incremental learning methods to detect threats that impact the control loops in a plant. We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90\% precision and with accuracy higher than 95\%.},

Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.},

  abstract = {Abstract A systems perspective of an emergent field such as Industry 4.0 requires combining and analysing the entire multidisciplinary scholarship under one map. Recent developments in scientometric analysis allow researchers to carry out complex bibliometric analyses coupled with an unstructured ontological discovery made available through thematic and ensuing semantic analyses to gain a holistic outlook on the ecosystem of Industry 4.0. The state-of-the-art review of the entire scholarship of Industry 4.0 demonstrates three broad clusters—the implications of automation on industry, the integration of technologies and technological advancements driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The scholarship output is, for the first time, compared with the leading industrial and policymaking institutional reports to highlight similarities and discrepancies. This allows to propose a previously unavailable definition of Industry 4.0, which is much needed to progress the research further. The three highly discrepant areas between academic literature and industry insights include lack of research into return on investment, lack of research involving policymaking, and the implications of technological development on the workforce, firms and countries. It is imperative to drive research into the existent, as well as the highlighted, themes in advancing the knowledge and aligning the academic scholarship with the interests of practitioners.},

The creation, protection, exchange, valorization, enrichment and monetization of intangible assets all come up against obstacles in the form of three categories of systemic asymmetries: trust and security asymmetries, information and control asymmetries, and revenue and recognition asymmetries. The original Bitcoin protocol, called proof of work, aims to prevent malicious people from attacking the Bitcoin network by forcing them to use their computing power to prove their contributions to the network. Private protocols, such as proof of authority, are more “human centered” and can achieve a much lower carbon footprint. The augmentation convergence of the Bio, Phy and Digital worlds is based on the AugmentChain propelled by three “pyramidal” engines, the enablers, the catalysts and the outcome that work together in short cycles.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated for more than 60 years. With the development of computing power, innovative algorithms, and gathering of massive data, AI will be rejuvenated in the next decade and become one of the most important enabling technologies for 5G automation. How to use the powerful analysis, judgment, and prediction capabilities provided by the AI algorithms to enable 5G equipment, networks and service systems, and combine them with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of carriers' networks become an important topic in the ICT industry. Based on deep understanding, accumulated experience in telecom field, and long-term investment in AI strategies, many organizations have been introducing AI technology to telecom networks and contributing to development of standards essential for improving the quality and security of AI products and services, ensuring user safety and creating a fair and open industry ecosystem. 5G networks can be automatically deployed (automatic service deployment and automatic running) with the introduction of AI based on application scenarios. AI algorithms can also be used for self-healing (automatic fault recovery), self-optimization (network self-optimization) and creating autonomous 5G systems (self-evolving networks), which continuously improve network efficiency and reduce OPEX. This article aims at presenting the most relevant use cases, prominent research outcomes, latest standard developments and related standardization gaps, examples of AI strategy interpretation, AI solutions – including communication intelligent platform, AI model service, and deployment solution – and typical application scenarios. As a part of this framework, this article introduces the most important aspects of AI security, in terms of protecting the integrity and confidentiality of AI models and data, and thus preventing attackers from changing the inference results or stealing data.},

  abstract = {Abstract Business process management (BPM) provides many benefits for a company including productivity, efficiency, compliance, risk management, consistency, repeatability, and measurability. Many of these aspects also ensure and improve functional safety, privacy, and security in process execution. However, managed business processes lack flexibility; ie, changing a business process requires more effort than ad hoc execution and adaptation. Thus, especially in small companies, the acceptance rate of managed business processes is low. So we claim that in current BPM approaches, the structuredness ensuring functional safety and security concepts contradicts with the objective for flexibility. The main goal of the AdaBPM project is to address this contradiction by providing a formal approach to handle advanced adaptations and exception handling in business processes. The technical objectives of the project include (1) the definition of a basic framework being capable of handling different levels of adaptivity and considering security and safety requirements at the same time, (2) a rigorous process specification language and model refinement methods, (3) static business process adaptations, and (4) dynamic (or ad hoc) adaptations. The result of our research is a general approach for flexible BPM combined with the possibility to nevertheless manage the process and define safety and security restrictions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The digital transformation of buildings becomes a critical component of the digital transformation agenda of any organization. The mission of the building has to support the mission of the businesses. This chapter presents example after example in every industry segment of how the built environment accentuates the mission of the business. Artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to flourish and making a breakthrough in the building industry. It is transforming the energy and building industries with intelligent solutions that can make buildings more intelligent, safe, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable. The chapter talks about the major areas of the built environment where AI will make a substantial impact, including AI-driven adaptive buildings, occupant productivity, frictionless experiences, predictive and remote maintenance, converged security, and energy management. It also discusses a few key areas where the shift in building technology has already started, including building operating system, cloud-edge architecture, natural language interfaces, and building lifecycle management.},
