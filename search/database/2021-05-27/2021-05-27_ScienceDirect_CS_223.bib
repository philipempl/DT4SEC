We consider the future of blockchain in supply chains and how the developments in other technologies are likely to affect its potential to improve supply chain management. The chapter also addresses the importance of organizational, interorganizational, and cultural changes to benefit from the potential of blockchain. It argues that while some actors may see an opportunity to distort the truth for profitable gains, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery can change the economics of truth and bring blockchain closer to a truth machine. Recommendations and implications for policymakers, companies, and scholarly research are discussed.}

This paper, to support automated driving systems (assisted, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles), introduces a cognitive layer called Associated Reality to enhance the involved information, knowledge and communication processes. The architecture defined includes an augmented Local Dynamic Map, with complementary layers, and an augmented Graph Database, with complementary semantic–cognitive relations, for the considered purpose, in cooperative human–machine and machine–machine systems. Virtual augmented landmarks are defined to improve the connectivity and intelligence of the involved spatial-information systems. Different structure landmarks and sequence landmarks (which includes regular, repetitive and periodic landmarks) are defined, categorized and used in diverse visual localization and mapping scenarios, for autonomous driving. In this paper, it is also shown, as a proof-of-concept for vehicle localization and mapping in road tunnels, the visual detection of different sequences of periodic luminaires, using YOLO v3 for the corresponding LED lights detection, or a specific alternative procedure developed with very low computational cost.}

abstract = {3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology's benefits. This technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.}

Gartner (2016) published an extensive report on the opportunities for digitalization of upstream O&G. The report covered the projected operator impact for drilling and wells, field development, and production and operations. In the report, Exxon Mobil's chief computational scientist is quoted as saying, the “oil patch's digital transformation will be comparable to horizontal drilling's tech revolution” (Endress, 2017) (which, of course, was the game-changing technology that enabled the shale gas revolution, among other major industry achievements). Furthermore, the report states that “…he predicts the digitalization of oilfield equipment and operations will continue for the foreseeable future, due to future competitive advantages and untold economic value” (Endress, 2017).

A first order disruption is a localized change, within a market or industry. A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.}

A hybrid research methodology is proposed to investigate the criticality of factors, their hierarchical model, and cause & effect relationships. 35 Employees from two geographies, namely India (N=17) and Netherlands (N=18) in hospitality and tourism firms, were interviewed. In the next step, the expert opinions were collected using the Analytic hierarchy process - Interpretive Structural Modeling- Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ISM-DEMATEL) technique. A forward-looking approach was adopted by considering the implications of barriers and drivers on the adoption of BCT and thereby benefiting HTS. The results suggest that ‘low cost’ and ‘risk management’ are the key drivers with driving power of 1 and 10 in Indian and the Netherlands, respectively. They are placed at I and VI hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group. ‘Lack of Government Regulation/ Policy’ and ‘Market Uncertainty’ are the critical barriers with driving power 9 and 10 in the Indian and Netherlands context, respectively.

This chapter discusses how most of these issues can be addressed through intelligent use of real-time operating data continuously collected from their production facilities. It advocates the use of a data-driven strategy to optimize operational efficiency and maintenance and enable business personnel to quickly and easily take corrective action when abnormal conditions occur. By taking corrective actions in real time, unnecessary costs can be avoided, bottom line profitability is increased, employee safety is maintained, and responsible environmental stewardship is achieved. The strategy uses real-time data infrastructure software as the integration layer between production process control systems (operational technology), business systems, and advanced offline analytics (information technology).}

More specifically, the action research method was applied in two industry case studies that implemented and tested the designed architecture in a global logistics environment. Case Study A examined the blockchain application in cross-border cargo movements whereas Case Study B investigated the application in a liquid chemical logistics company serving to petroleum industries. Our research analysis has identified that the Case A subject had disconnected systems and services for blockchain wherein the big data interactions had failed (failure case). Whereas in Case B, the company has achieved nearly 25% increase in revenue through its customer service after the blockchain implementation and thereby reduction in paperwork and carbon emissions (success case). This research contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge to big data and blockchain by identifying key implementation guideline and issues for blockchain in supply chain management. Further, action-based research coupled with a case study approach has been used to evaluate the application aspects of the architecture's scalability and functionality of bigdata and blockchain in supply chain management.}

We invested in a mix of desk research with qualitative methods, including interviews, surveys, or ethnographic explorations, together with participatory workshops for collective vision building and speculative prototyping for policy. Our main findings underline key sociotechnical challenges and opportunities for the development and uptake of Blockchain in specific European industrial and business contexts, taking into account the complexity of policy, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental elements.

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing decision making processes within the manufacturing industry. Among the technological portfolio enabling this revolution, the late literature has capitalized on the potential of data analytics for improving the production cycle at different stages, from resource provisioning to planning, delivery and storage. However, such a promising role of data analytics has been so far explored without a proper, quantitative inspection of the cost-improvement trade-off, nor has the process of acquiring sensors and extracting valuable information from their captured data formalized in a series of methodological steps. This paper introduces the Analyze, Sense, Preprocess, Predict, Implement and Deploy (ASPPID) methodology, an iterative decision workflow that spans from the acquisition of sensing equipment to the quantitative assessment of the contribution of their captured data to enhance the production step under focus. By placing the data scientist at the core of the workflow, this methodology helps improvement teams make informed decisions about which parts of the process need to be sensed, and how to exploit this information towards a verifiable improvement of the production cycle. The implementation of this methodology is exemplified in a real use case within the automotive industry, where the detection of defects in an annealing process can be modeled as a classification problem over a highly imbalanced dataset. Results obtained after applying the proposed ASPPID methodology show that the scrap ratio is reduced by sensing the correct part of the process at minimal investment costs, thus highlighting the crucial role of the data scientist in the management team of manufacturing plants.}

From there we follow the developments in the 1980s and the benchmarks in Europe in the 1990s revealing the large differences in outcomes when various teams work out the risks of a same plant. It showed the uncertainties intrinsic to the methodology of that time. The last 2 decades have seen various kinds of improvements but also awareness that other factors, such as human failure and organizational ones are important to include. The last subchapter is highlighting approaches partly based on machine learning and artificial intelligence that will make use of “big data,” even enabling dynamic operational risk assessment.}

The respondents were executives of industrials firms whose factories, warehouses, and headquarters are located in Northern Italy. This is undoubtedly the European region first and most extensively affected by the pandemic, and the government implemented radical lockdown measures, banning nonessential travel and mandating the shutdown of all nonessential businesses. Several major effects on both product and service businesses are highlighted, including the disruption of field-service operations and supply networks. This study also highlights the increased importance of servitization business models and the acceleration of digital transformation and advanced services. To help firms navigate through the crisis and be better positioned after the pandemic, the authors present a four-stage crisis management model (calamity, quick & dirty, restart, and adapt), which provides insights and critical actions that should be taken to cope with the expected short and long-term implications of the crisis. Finally, this study discusses how servitization can enhance resilience for future crises—providing a set of indicators on the presumed role of, and impact on, service operations in relation to what executives expect to be the “next normal.”}

First, the last chapter gives an overview of the remaining key issues in maritime supply chains, hampering the transition from a linear maritime supply chain thinking toward a network industry. It furthermore provides solutions for handling those problems. Second, following Finger and Jaag 2015, the reshaping of the maritime supply chain is discussed from the industry, policy, and management perspectives. Last, some scenarios of how the industry should evolve from partner collaboration (one-to-one collaboration) to a maritime supply network (many-to-many collaboration) are discussed. From a business perspective, this trend of (maritime) actors banding together platform-enabled ecosystems can leverage their strengths and competitiveness.}

It extends the scope and depth of resources sharing and enables society-based manufacturing integration. SharedMfg is complex and is still in its infancy. It demands encouraging research to clarify the concept and understand the key operations. In this paper, the SharedMfg is analysed along with two significant manufacturing evolutional trends, (i.e., Servitization and Industry 4.0). Based on this, to reduce the complexities in operations, the concept and definition of SharedMfg are presented on the basis of a service hierarchy that includes Product-Service System, Configuration-Service System and Resource-Service System. At the same time, this paper looks SharedMfg as an independent socialization manufacturing mode (e.g. compared with Cloud Manufacturing), and also, the benefit in contributing to the integration of the manufacturing and service sectors is revealed. However, apart from the complexity, high-degree dynamics and uncertainties related to service operations challenge the application of SharedMfg as well. To meet both requirements, based on the construction of a three-dimensional SharedMfg Service (SMS) modelling framework, a hybrid integration and interoperable SharedMfg architecture is proposed to ensure the provision of SMS in efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, a dynamic SMS scheduling method in support of the technologies of Complex Network Analysis is presented. A case study associated with the networked fabrication of an assistive glove is applied by implementing a prototype system to validate the proposed frameworks and methods. Finally, an experiment for evaluating the efficiency of service matching is carried out to prove the SharedMfg that can provide better performance than Cloud Manufacturing and Social Manufacturing.}

Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.}

Although automation and assistance technologies are becoming more prevalent in production and logistics, there is consensus that humans will remain an essential part of operations systems. Nevertheless, human factors are still underrepresented in this research stream resulting in an important research and application gap. This article first exposes this gap by presenting the results of a focused content analysis of earlier research on Industry 4.0. To contribute to closing this gap, it then develops a conceptual framework that integrates several key concepts from the human factors engineering discipline that are important in the context of Industry 4.0 and that should thus be considered in future research in this area. The framework can be used in research and development to systematically consider human factors in Industry 4.0 designs and implementations. This enables the analysis of changing demands for humans in Industry 4.0 environments and contributes towards a successful digital transformation that avoid the pitfalls of innovation performed without attention to human factors. The paper concludes with highlighting future research directions on human factors in Industry 4.0 as well as managerial implications for successful applications in practice.}

Addressing deployment costs, incentives, and governance, this paper explores a blockchain-based approach for the deployment of product-centric information systems. Through explorative design science and systematic combining, the deployment of a permissionless blockchain system for collecting product life-cycle data is conceptualized, demonstrated, and evaluated by experts. The purpose of the blockchain-based solution is to manage product data interactions, to maintain an accurate single state of product information, and to provide an economic incentive structure for the provision and the deployment of the solution. The evaluation by knowledgeable researchers and practitioners identifies the aspects limiting blockchain-based deployment of solutions in the current industrial landscape. Combining theory and practice, the paper lays the foundation for a blockchain-based approach to product information management, placing design priority on inter-industrial and self-sustained deployment.}

The interpretive structural modeling technique is further used for mapping the interrelationships among various energy sustainability functions identified. The interpretive model developed, and the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement analysis offered exciting insights into the Industry 4.0-energy sustainability interactions. Findings show that Industry 4.0 promotes energy sustainability via a very complex mechanism that involves ten interrelated functions. Contrary to the general opinion, production efficiency offered by the digitalization of the manufacturing industry is not the immediate and most essential energy efficiency outcome of the digital industrial transformation. Industry 4.0 primarily contributes to energy sustainability by enabling the energy industry to reshape its operating landscape and enjoy more advanced, intelligent, and complicated energy production and distribution equipment. The digitalization of the energy demand sector, digitalization of the manufacturing industry, and the introduction of smarter and more sustainable products are among the main opportunities of Industry 4.0 for energy sustainability. Overall, the study and the ISM model of energy sustainability developed explains how Industry 4.0 contributes to energy sustainability via different functions and how each function is placed within the structural model based on its driving and dependence powers.}

abstract = {Continuous manufacturing, an emerging technology in the pharmaceutical industry, has the potential to increase the efficiency, and agility of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. To realize these potential benefits of continuous operations, effectively managing materials, equipment, analyzers, and data is vital. Developments for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing have led to novel technologies and methods for processing material, designing and configuring individual equipment and process analyzers, as well as implementing strategies for active process control. However, limited work has been reported on managing abnormal conditions during operations to prevent unplanned deviations and downtime and sustain system capabilities. Moreover, although the sourcing, analysis, and management of real-time data have received growing attention, limited discussion exists on the continued verification of the infrastructure for ensuring reliable operations. Hence, this work introduces condition-based maintenance (CBM) as a general strategy for continually verifying and sustaining advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing systems, with a focus on the continuous manufacture of oral solid drug products (OSD-CM). Frameworks, such as CBM, benefit unified efforts towards continued verification and operational excellence by leveraging process knowledge and the availability of real-time data. A vital implementation consideration for manufacturing operations management applications, such as CBM, is a systems architecture and an enabling infrastructure. This work outlines the systems architecture design for CBM in OSD-CM and highlights sample fault scenarios involving equipment and process analyzers. For illustrative purposes, this work also describes the infrastructure implemented on an OSD-CM testbed, which uses commercially available automation systems and leverages enterprise architecture standards. With the increasing digitalization of manufacturing operations in the pharmaceutical industry, proactively using process data towards modernizing maintenance practices is relevant to a single unit operation as well as to a series of physically integrated unit operations.}

Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.}

Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.}

abstract = {Smart manufacturing systems are an attractive target for cyber attacks, because they embed valuable data and critical equipment. Despite the market is driving towards integrated and interconnected factories, current smart manufacturing systems are still designed under the assumption that they will stay isolated from the corporate network and the outside world. This choice may result in an internal architecture with insufficient network and system compartmentalization. As a result, once an attacker has gained access, they have full control of the entire production plant because of the lack of network segmentation. With the goal of raising cybersecurity awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study showing attack scenarios that we have validated on a real modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical security counter measures. The testbed smart manufacturing system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory hosted by Politecnico di Milano, and comprises seven assembly stations, each with their programmable logic controllers and human-computer interfaces, as well as an industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place tasks. On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a system not directly connected to any public network. We conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an adversary can use to cause physical impact on the production, or keep persistent access to the plant. We are unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the premises of a research facility, following a scientific methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a good first step to inspire follow up research on the many verticals that we touch.}

Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.}

This means the adaptation of a data-driven manufacturing model, which includes the horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain and the management of data across the whole product life cycle. Currently companies face two major problems in this transformation of their IT architectures: 1) There are multiple reference architectures for Industrie 4.0, whose suitability has not been evaluated in a straightforward way. 2) There are no maturity models to objectively assess data-driven IT architectures. In this work we address these problems by providing an overview of Industrie 4.0 features in multiple reference architectures and developing a maturity model for IT architectures for data-driven manufacturing. We first give an overview of the current maturity models with aspects of data-driven manufacturing. Based on this overview we survey three reference architectures for Industrie 4.0: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0, and the Stuttgart IT Architecture for Manufacturing. We analyze and assess each approach and define maturity levels for data-driven manufacturing to guide companies in the adaption process of Industrie 4.0, as well as criteria for meeting these levels.}

The key questions facing firms are: How can we capitalize on the three primary dimensions (the increasing new-age technology adoption, the growth of big data and analytics, and the increased importance of key stakeholders) and overcome their associated challenges to achieve sustainable firm growth? This study aims to revive the thinking based on the growth strategy literature in the current environment, by presenting a 4E growth strategy matrix comprising of entrenching, empowering, enterprising, and enriching growth strategies. We propose that a firm can invest resources to maximize on one, two, or all three primary dimensions to produce the four growth strategies. We present an organizing framework based on insights from our triangulated research approach. Each of the growth strategies discussed will result in building certain types of firm capabilities, which will then lead to serving the needs and well-being of the key stakeholders.

Nonetheless, barriers still exist, as suitable methods are needed to handle complex networks of actors, often with competing objectives, while determining design and operational decisions for systems across a wide spectrum of features and time-scales. This review looks at the current developments in the smart energy sector, focussing on techniques in the main application areas along with relevant implemented examples, while highlighting some of the key challenges currently faced and outlining future pathways for the sector. A detailed overview of a framework developed for the EU H2020 funded Sharing Cities project is also provided to illustrate the nature of the design stages encountered and control hierarchies required.

At the same time, the energy generation gradually reshapes into decentralised network with lower capacity, but able to manage demand and supply in real-time. However, the penetration of online platforms within the energy sector poses policy questions that are specific to platforms' business models. This study investigates a sample of 217 digital platforms running energy-related activities across the EU regional markets. These energy platforms make about 20% of the world energy platforms. By observing their characteristics and those of their surrounding markets, it appears that the digital platforms in the European energy sector still tend to be relatively small and concentrated in specific regions, often in the neighbourhood of capital cities. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis suggests that market size, digital readiness and regulatory quality are the most important features relating to platforms' presence in the EU regional markets. This paper offers empirical evidence and reflections to provide energy policy with key information to best ripe the potential of new technologies while being aware of their inherited complexities.}

A comprehensive review of the literature regarding the application of blockchain in the construction domain found that there are few studies and applications of blockchain in construction practices, and most of the current research involves qualitative studies only. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of applying both public blockchain and private blockchain technologies in the construction industry using two industry cases. Two business process cases (i.e., Case 1 and Case 2) were selected and used to drive the blockchain-based software system architecture design. The proposed architectures were demonstrated using Hyperledger Fabric (a private, permissioned and open source blockchain platform) and Ethereum (a public blockchain platform) respectively, to reflect the different requirements of the two use cases. This pilot study also illustrates the process, benefits, and challenges of adopting private and public blockchain technologies in construction domain. This research provides insights to researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption of blockchain technology, especially in construction industry.}

The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. ‘Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement’ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders – leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians – to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.}

These disruptions failed to change Curricula, Teaching-Learning processes, Assessment appreciably in the large number of engineering institutions in several countries across the world. Same old processes despite switching over to Outcome Based Education or EESD or Industry 4.0 are being continued. Disruption is most sought after in engineering education as it offers lot of advantages like leadership, profit and professional standing. Many Institutions offering engineering programs try to implement disruptions but fail because of lack of understanding about disruption and the associated processes, required finances, Human Resources and more importantly the innovation capabilities. Disruption is a process where a product outsmarts others through Innovation either in Technology or in Product or in processes. Disruption is building a new eco-system to meet the customer’s purpose of buying a product, service or a program. Of late people are trying to implement innovations in Engineering Education with no knowledge of Disruption, its properties and processes. In this paper, we try to take an example of Kingsmen Coffee, a company trying to disrupt in the Indian market, analyse what it is offering and how they are trying to disrupt the existing players and what lessons does it offer to Engineering Educators in Disruption. Kingsmen Coffee is a coffee dispensing machine with new technology and the way it is creating win-win situations for all the stake holders involved, is a matter of interest and study for Engineering Educators. Through this study of Disruption, essential pre-requisites for disruption to happen are noted and they are used to extrapolate for realizing disruption in engineering education. Some suggestions regarding implementation of Disruption are given.}

However, these offerings seldom enhance revenue, because companies struggle with business model (BM) dynamics. By analyzing 27 companies through an explorative case-study approach, the authors consider how companies can successfully achieve revenue enhancement through digital offerings. The result is a threefold framework for revenue enhancement through digital offerings. First, this framework distinguishes between three phases of BM dynamics: 1) augmenting products through a “hardware plus” logic, 2) developing a portfolio of multiple logics for creating customer value, 3) integrating this portfolio through platform logic. Second, the framework emphasizes that three barriers, which we refer to as confidence, mixing, and collaboration barrier, limit the progress from Phases 1 to 3. Third, the framework reveals that each phase contains certain modifications of BM components. In the first phase, companies adapt their BM components slightly, so as to advance toward a “hardware plus” logic. In the second phase, companies embrace more radical BM innovations in order to convert services into an outcome-based BM and develop a new software subscription BM. In the third phase, companies modify BM components in order to integrate the BMs internally and to open them up for external collaboration partners.}

From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.}

The device ecosystem expands frenetically with the arrival of trendy and handy, slim and sleek, disappearing and disposable gadgets, gizmos thereby ubiquitous (anywhere, anytime, and any device) access, and usage of web-scale information, content, and services get fructified. Finally, all sorts of casually found and cheap articles in our everyday environments (homes, hotels, hospitals, etc.) are being systematically digitized and service enabled in order to exhibit a kind of real-world smartness and sagacity in their individual as well as collective actions and reactions. Thus trillions of digitized objects, billions of connected devices, and millions of polyglot software services are bound to interact insightfully with one another over locally as well as with remote ones over any networks purposefully. And hence the amount of transactional, operational, analytical, commercial, social, personal, and professional data created through a growing array of interactions and collaborations is growing very rapidly. Now if the data getting collected, processed, and stocked are not subjected to deeper, deft, and decisive investigations, then the tactically as well as strategically sound knowledge (the beneficial patterns, tips, techniques, associations, alerts, risk factors, fresh opportunities, possibilities, etc.) hidden inside the data heaps goes unused literally. For collecting, stocking, and processing such a large amount of multistructured data, the traditional databases, analytics platforms, the ETL tools, etc., are found insufficient. Hence the Apache Hadoop ecosystem technologies and tools are being touted as the best way forward to squeeze out the right and relevant knowledge. In this chapter, you can find the details about the emerging technologies and platforms for spearheading the big data movement.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 systems are extensively using artificial intelligence (AI) to enable smartness, automation and flexibility within variety of processes. Due to the importance of the systems, they are potential targets for attackers trying to take control over the critical processes. Attackers use various vulnerabilities of such systems including specific vulnerabilities of AI components. It is important to make sure that inappropriate adversarial content will not break the security walls and will not harm the decision logic of critical systems. We believe that the corresponding security toolset must be organized as a trainable self-protection mechanism similar to immunity. We found certain similarities between digital vs. biological immunity and we study the possibilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to provide the basis for the digital immunity training. We suggest the taxonomy of GANs (including new architectures) suitable to simulate various aspects of the immunity for Industry 4.0 applications.}

Some companies and experts believe that “Oil and Gas 4.0” can completely change the status quo of the oil and gas industry, which can bring huge benefits because it accelerates the digitization and intelligentization of the oil and gas industry. However, the “Oil and Gas 4.0” is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper systematically introduces the concept and core technologies of “Oil and Gas 4.0”, such as big data and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this paper analyzes typical application scenarios of the oil and gas industry chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) through examples, such as intelligent oilfield, intelligent pipeline, and intelligent refinery. It is concluded that the essence of “Oil and Gas 4.0” is a data-driven intelligence system based on the highly digitization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic peer-reviewed paper on the “Oil and Gas 4.0” era, aiming to let more oil and gas industry personnel understand its benefits and application scenarios, so as to better apply it to practical engineering in the future. In the discussion section, this paper also analyzes the opportunities and difficulties that may be brought about by the “Oil and Gas 4.0” era. Finally, relevant policy recommendations are proposed.}

This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The interrelations between these groups and individual high-impact publications are visualized using social network analysis. A structured overview of the main strands of research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual connections between publications and discourses is obtained. Based on the results, starting points for future research are derived, which offer researchers and practitioners a substantial basis for their work on smart contracts.}

abstract = {In today’s competitive scenario, the manufacturing industries are lagging behind in implementing the Industry 4.0 concept or in integrating smart, ubiquitous components due to high cost and high energy consumption due to the volatile market. The digital transformation has reshaped the manufacturing industries and has paved the way towards data-driven, intelligent, networked, and resilient manufacturing systems. In this context, Industry 4.0 is progressing exponentially and offers a productive output in terms of circular economy and cleaner production to attain ethical business by achieving accuracy, precision, and efficiency. Hence, there is a strong requirement to revamp the traditional manufacturing set-ups into smart manufacturing to gain self-adaptability, reliability, and flexibility with high quality and low-cost output. The paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for Industry 4.0 set-up to achieve circular economy and cleaner production by optimizing products-machine allocation. The proposed MILP model optimizes the trade-off between energy consumption and machine processing cost to gain a circular economy and cleaner production respectively. The proposed model also achieves ethical business by deploying sensors to capture real-time information to establish the Industry 4.0 facility. The paper discusses the product-machine specific analysis to optimize the manufacturing of customized and high-end products at low production cost with minimal energy consumption. The objective of the paper is to minimize the total cost and energy consumption of machines for establishing the Industry 4.0 facility to gain a circular economy and cleaner production. The proposed model is demonstrated and computationally tested on small, moderate, and large data instances and presented with their detailed analysis.}

However, many of the CMaaS platforms are centralized with data flowing through an intermediary agent connecting clients with service providers. This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.}

The international team (authors of this paper) worked together to analyse the status of this convergence through the assessment of concrete examples, referred to here as demonstrators, within advanced manufacturing systems. Four independent demonstrators from different sections of the manufacturing value chain and involving bio-inspiration, bio-integration and/or bio-intelligence were selected to test the following hypothesis: “That Future Manufacturing Systems will incorporate Components, Features, Characteristics and Capabilities that enable the convergence towards Living Systems”. Each of these four demonstrators have succeeded in supporting this hypothesis and in providing clear evidence to confirm that significant performance benefits may be derived through the “biologicalisation” of advanced manufacturing systems. This conclusion is of great significance for the next phases of development of manufacturing science and engineering globally. The evidence reported in this paper provides a robust basis for recommending that a deeper analysis of the implications of biologicalised manufacturing systems be undertaken. As a result of this early stage work, it is concluded that there is a high likelihood that this new convergence will lead to a major paradigm shift in advanced manufacturing. Outstanding opportunities exist for high levels of innovation in the next stages of development of advanced manufacturing processes and systems from the biological perspective. The relationship between the human and the physical manufacturing system will also change and the world of advanced manufacturing will be confronted with many new challenges including important ethical questions.}

A set of advanced technologies for digitalisation and a theory-based set of seven value drivers for PSM are identified for the proposed grid to facilitate the design of applications and interventions for digitalising PSM. The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.}

AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study’s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security. Given the pace of development in information technology, AI and data analysis, regulatory approvals for new services and products in the new Era of digital energy markets can be enforced as quickly and efficiently as possible.}

This paper provides a different perspective by examining relevant challenges and providing examples of some less-talked-about yet essential topics, such as hybrid systems, redefining advanced manufacturing, basic building blocks of new manufacturing, ecosystem readiness, and technology scalability. The first major challenge is to (re-)define what the manufacturing of the future will be, if we wish to: ① raise public awareness of new manufacturing’s economic and societal impacts, and ② garner the unequivocal support of policy-makers. The second major challenge is to recognize that manufacturing in the future will consist of systems of hybrid systems of human and robotic operators; additive and subtractive processes; metal and composite materials; and cyber and physical systems. Therefore, studying the interfaces between constituencies and standards becomes important and essential. The third challenge is to develop a common framework in which the technology, manufacturing business case, and ecosystem readiness can be evaluated concurrently in order to shorten the time it takes for products to reach customers. Integral to this is having accepted measures of “scalability” of non-information technologies. The last, but not least, challenge is to examine successful modalities of industry–academia–government collaborations through public–private partnerships. This article discusses these challenges in detail.}

Besides, digitalization has brought a vast amount of information and data sources that MM may exploit to improve its processes and asset-related decision-making. This evolution of MM has brought a lot of opportunities but also various criticalities about information and data management. Data models are envisioned to provide significant support to this end. However, a common reference data taxonomy is needed for the correct development of data models. This work aims at exploring how the data taxonomy could help in addressing the current criticalities by synthesizing most information and data classes that support MM. The data taxonomy, along with other elements, like data models, effectively support companies in improving the management of their information and data. The usefulness of a data taxonomy is proved thanks to action research in a company within the automotive sector aiming at improving the MM process.}

Ontologies play an important role in SOCx as they facilitate data readability and reasoning by machines. A better understanding of ontologies is required in order to develop and incorporate them in SOCx. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art research on building data ontologies since 2014 within the SOCx domain through sorting them based on building data types, general approaches, and applications. The data types of two main domains of building information modeling and building management system have been considered in the majority of existing ontologies. Three main applications are evident from a critical analysis of existing ontologies: (1) key performance indicator calculation, (2) building performance improvement, and (3) fault detection and diagnosis. The key gaps found in the literature review are a holistic ontology for SOCx and insight on how such approaches should be evaluated. Based on these findings, this study provides recommendations for future necessary research including: identification of SOCx-related data types, assessment of ontology performance, and creation of open-source approaches.}

abstract = {Cloud-based CNC (C-CNC) is an emerging concept within Industry 4.0 where computer numerical control (CNC) functionalities are moved to the cloud and provided to manufacturing machines as a service. Among many benefits, C-CNC allows manufacturing machines to leverage advanced control algorithms running on cloud computers to boost their performance at low cost, without need for major hardware upgrades. However, a fundamental challenge of C-CNC is how to guarantee safety and reliability of machine control given variable Internet quality of service (e.g. delays), especially on public Internet networks. We propose a three-tier redundant architecture to address this challenge. We then prototype tier one of the architecture on a 3D printer successfully controlled via C-CNC over public Internet connections, and discuss follow-on research opportunities.}

abstract = {The digital era is characterized by fast development, growth, innovation, and disruption. Organizations that want to survive must be ready to adapt to the new digital landscape. The digital transformation process is more than just implementing new technology, investing in tools, or upgrading existing systems. These steps are important, but they are not the whole picture. If an organization wants to stay competitive, it won’t just be able to respond to changes, it should expect them and stimulate innovation itself. To do this, companies need to plan ahead and be active designers for their future. This is where the digital transformation strategy comes in. The digital transformation strategy helps leaders answer the questions for their business such as the current digitalization level, future vision, and how to get there. To be protected from digital disruption, companies need to develop three core competencies related to awareness, informed decision-making, and rapid implementation. The development and implementation of a digital transformation strategy have become a key concern for many organizations across manufacturing industries, but how such a strategy can be developed remains an open question. In this paper, we will be discussing how manufacturing could develop a digital transformation strategy that including a different aspect of the strategy tailored to the nature of the manufacturing sector.}

These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.}

abstract = {The Physical Internet (PI), a new vision for the future of the global freight transport and logistics system, describes a geographical hierarchy of interconnected networks of networks, from the urban, to the national, the continental, and the global level. Like today, in PI the maritime ports will fulfil roles as continental and global hubs. Differently than ports today, however, decisions to split and bundle cargo across ships and other modes will not be made solely on the basis of long-term agreements by ports, but rather ever more dynamically and in real-time, aiming to reconsolidate shipments within the port area. This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally. We provide insights into the approach’s applicability by means of the illustrative case of Teesport, located in Northeast England (United Kingdom).}

abstract = {Manufacturing companies across all major industries are facing serious challenges trying to competitively design and manage modern products, which are becoming increasingly complex multi-domain systems or “systems of systems”. Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders’ needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {In recent years, the need for Operational Technology (OT) defenses has been recognized, serving as an additional line of defense when Information Technology (IT) defenses are bypassed. This is no longer considered an uncommon possibility when dealing with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors expected to be state-sponsored and receiving insider assistance. In these extreme adversarial situations, OT defenses aim to provide another layer of defense for the system, introduced directly at the physical process level, as described by the sensors data, the system model, and control actions. Just like IT defenses, two schools of thought, i.e., passive and active defenses, have emerged to address this challenge. In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors.}

Manufacturing now has the opportunity to gather large quantities of data, coming from different areas, such as product and process design, assembly, material planning, quality control, scheduling, maintenance, fault detection and cover all the product life cycle phases. The extraction of value from data is a new challenge that companies are now experiencing. Therefore, the need for analytical information system is growing, in order to explore datasets and discover useful and often hidden information. Data analytics became a keyword in this context, but sometimes it is not clear how different methods or tools are defined and could be effectively used to analyze data in manufacturing. The paper aims to present and clarify the meaning of terms that are currently and frequently used in the context of analytics. The paper also provides an overview of the data analysis techniques that could be used to extract knowledge from data along the manufacturing process.}

Industry 4.0, building on the integration of information and communication technologies, Internet of things, robotics, additive manufacturing, and artificial intelligence, aims for developing autonomous and dynamic operations to enable the mass production of highly customized products. Industry 4.0 and quality management share the same objective, that is, improving process performance, yet through different trajectories. However, notwithstanding Industry 4.0 developments, quality management models have remained stagnant and failed to keep abreast of these advancements. This paper evaluates the alignment of quality management models with Industry 4.0. The paper shows that quality models are not congruent with Industry 4.0. The former build on the paradigm that supports establishing formal systems, compliance with specifications, and meeting requirements which are quite irrelevant to Industry 4.0. The paper compares the features of Industry 4.0 against quality models, highlights inadequacies in quality models, and develops recommendations for future quality models. This study is the first to review quality management models in light of the Industry 4.0 developments.}

abstract = {The many scholars approaching Industry 4.0 today need to confront the lack of an agreed-upon definition, posing serious limitations to theory building and research comparability. Since its initial German conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the Industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms − such as “smart manufacturing”, “digital transformation”, and “fourth industrial revolution” − have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts. The review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. Each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. This categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets.}

abstract = {The introduction of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) into manufacturing systems involves a wide range of opportunities and risks. The latter are critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and could either lead to their future success or jeopardize their economic survival. To scrutinize the impact of an I4.0 solution on their processes, SMEs need to assess their trans formed processes holistically with respect to numerous perspectives. Existing assessment approaches either focus on a single I4.0 solution in isolation, assess exclusively from the technological perspective, or lack an overall procedural and economic impact evaluation. The aim of this contribution is to develop a framework of performance metrics for the holistic impact evaluation of I4.0 solutions on SMEs. In the framework, we consolidate the impacts of technology applications discussed in the literature into 16 main fields of action and define adequate performance metrics to assess each of them. The resulting performance framework combines traditional metrics for the evaluation of supply chain processes i.e., supply chain operations reference-metrics and the global reporting initiative, and extends them with additional performance metrics relevant to the assessment of I4.0 solutions. This framework aims to facilitate and systemize the selection of adequate attributes for the evaluation of I4.0 solutions. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the practical utility of the framework and its convenience for the purpose of an assessment.}

abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoDs) is getting growing interest of researchers due to its applicability in wide range of applications for transportation, weather monitoring, emergency monitoring for flood, earth quake, healthcare and road hazards. To update the data about emergency situation, a real-time data sharing is mandatory. However, regular message transmission by various drones may not only overwhelm a central server but it also causes congestion on the network. It is mandatory to reduce messaging cost and congestion. This paper presents a fog-assisted congestion avoidance approach for Smooth Message Dissemination (SMD). We present a message forwarding algorithm for congestion avoidance to select the appropriate next-hop node using layered model. This model is based on various layers having drones. In first phase, it looks for an appropriate drone in a layer near the fog server for message forwarding. In next step, the drone is identified in nearby layers to forward the emergency message to next-hop to further locate the group head as per priority. It is a drone that has less distance towards fog server and inform in its one-hop circle. It can stop forwarding message after delivering it to fog server. Finally, the fog server disseminates information timely towards upper layers for necessary actions for emergency situations. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations using NS 2.35. Results prove the dominance of SMD over counterparts in terms of messaging overhead, packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption and average delay. Proposed SMD improves PDR by 85% and message overhead cost by 91% as compared to counterparts.}

This shift stems from several features relevant to Industry 4.0, specifically the increase of the importance of the digital world and the fostering of the development of more autonomous and intelligent systems that will interact and interoperate with humans in more open production environments. The first aim of this paper is to study to what extent Industry 4.0 impacts ethics. The second one is to raise the awareness of researchers regarding potential ethical risks when designing and evaluating future Industry 4.0 compliant production systems. For that purpose, the ethical stakes of industry 4.0 are first presented. Then, an overview of related work is done to evaluate the different scientific fields potentially contributing to the study of the ethical dimension in Industry 4.0. A discussion is finally proposed from this overview. The main conclusion of this discussion concerns the urgent need to address the ethical dimension of scientific contributions relevant to Industry 4.0, given the lack of work in that field.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

In this paper we extend the use of Wikipedia by comparing the German edition with the world largest edition (in English) in order to examine whether there are significant structural differences. We first validate the use of Wikipedia for emerging technologies and for cross-language comparisons as a tool for (almost) real time strategic analysis. We then extract all Wikipedia pages related to Industry 4.0, build up a knowledge network and study its topological properties in the two editions. We find striking differences, which can be explained with respect to the persistence of the industrial pattern of specialization of Germany with respect to all other countries. Emerging technologies introduce novelty but also preserve path-dependency in the pattern of specialization. The implications for companies and policy makers are discussed.}

Specifically, it looks at the following supply chain management (SCM) objectives: (a) Reducing costs; (b) Assuring quality of products; (c) Increasing speed; (d) Increasing dependability; (e) Reducing risks; (f) Facilitating sustainable practices; and (g) Enhancing flexibility. This chapter uses a number of practical applications and real-world examples to delve into blockchain's roles in contributing to these objectives. A key argument is that blockchain makes it possible to trace ingredients and components across multiple tiers of a supply chain because data must be shared in a tamperproof way and must be accessible to relevant parties. Blockchain, thus, facilitates traceability, which is among the key mechanisms by which blockchain can help firms meet the various supply chain objectives.}

The DeepQA technology of Watson (a massively parallel probabilistic evidence-based architecture) can effectively deconstruct a question and result in a hypothesis with evidence and confidence scoring. There are key differences between characteristics of AI and cognitive computing even though cognitive computing is considered within the realm of AI. NLP, the machine’s capability to understand language and is the intersection of AI, computer science, and linguistics. NLP consists of natural language understanding and generation and is used in chatbots.

abstract = {Industry 4.0 was introduced with the hope of transitioning to the next industrial revolution. I4.0 is a vision of increasing flexibility and efficiency within a system of low complexity. Despite this intention, Industry 4.0 has required users to understand complex information and communication systems, limiting usability and therefore not necessarily satisfying the original vision. However, application of principles from the Lean Production Systems originally developed in the 1930’s in combination with Industry 4.0, may help to reach its desired goals. Through a literature review, this paper discusses the current state of art of Industry 4.0 and some Lean Production Systems principles. The paper focuses on a model combining Lean Production Systems with Industry 4.0, that was created in response to the shortcomings of the anticipated industrial revolution. With a Lean Production System as a foundation, the six design principles of I4.0 of interoperability, virtualization, decentralization, real-time capability, service orientation, and modularity can be better implemented to reach the vision of highly flexible and low complexity systems. In return, horizontal and vertical integration within Industry 4.0 can support and accelerate Lean principles by reducing human error and increasing intercommunications between the systems, resulting in a productive integration. The specific principles of Lean that could boost Industry 4.0 will be discussed, demonstrating why a company should be Lean, meaning value adding processes and stakeholder orientation are at its core.}

Among the several benefits offered by these technologies, is the infrastructure for harnessing big-data, machine learning (ML) and cloud computing software tools, for instance in designing advanced data analytics platforms. Although, this is an area of increased interest, the information concerning the implementation of data analytics in the context of Industry4.0 is scarcely available in scientific literature. Therefore, this work presents a process data analytics platform built around the concept of industry 4.0. The platform utilizes the state-of-the-art IIoT platforms, ML algorithms and big-data software tools. The platform emphasizes the use of ML methods for process data analytics while leveraging big-data processing tools and taking advantage of the currently available industrial grade cloud computing platforms. The industrial applicability of the platform was demonstrated by the development of soft sensors for use in a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. In the case study, the work studied data-driven soft sensors to predict syngas heating value and hot flue gas temperature. Among the studied data-driven methods, the neural network-based NARX model demonstrated better performance in the prediction of both syngas heating value and flue gas temperature. The modeling results showed that, in cases where process knowledge about the process phenomena at hand is limited, data-driven soft sensors are useful tools for predictive data analytics.}

Improvements in communications technologies allow the interconnection of systems into ever greater Systems of Systems. In these large-scale System-of-Systems domains, we manage their scale by creating a series of abstractions; such as metadata and metamodels. The chapter also identifies the core use of data as an element in an information processing chain involving the collection of the data, transformation into information to be internalised to provide knowledge that can be employed to interact effectively within a given context.

abstract = {The development of dynamic data-based Decision Support Systems (DSSs) along with the increasing availability of data in the industry, makes real-time data acquisition and management a challenge. Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database. This paper presents an implementation of the platform in the pharmaceutical industry, providing interoperability and real-time reaction capability to changes to an industrial prototype using dynamic scheduling algorithms.}

abstract = {One approach to developing futuristic views of technology is to draw upon experience and expertise. However, this becomes increasingly speculative as one moves to more distant timelines and visionary technological forms. This raises the question of whether it is possible to rationally predict how a technology development trajectory might unfold into the future, perhaps to some ‘ultimate form’, that is accessible, surfaces the necessary technological features for development as well as considers the implications for human–artefact relationships. The proposed approach is conceptually grounded in a parsimonious framework that examines different configurations of human–artefact relationships, revealing ‘Six Genres of Technology’. This suggests how the shift from human-human to artefact-artefact and the increasing autonomy of the artefacts (technological beings), introduces specific features to each of the six Genres. Four features are identified in the later Genres that in combination, could be construed as, or indeed pose a threat: autonomy, intelligence, language, and autopoiesis. This paper advances the debate about future technological developments by using the proposed framework to structure an argument about the key issues that should be discussed today - so that the developments of tomorrow can be more reflectively considered, appropriately debated and knowingly pursued.}

It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.}

In the meantime, the 4th industrial revolution, characterized by several technologies that allow digitalisation, optimisation, automation, customisation and more communication, is in progress. Thus, the ‘Industry 4.0’ can be an enabler for industrial sustainable development. Maintenance processes, which are fundamental for ensuring sustainable operation of manufacturing systems, can benefit from these technologies, with a consequent improvement of maintenance and manufacturing performance. Therefore, a strong synergy between I4.0 technologies and industrial maintenance processes for promoting sustainable manufacturing occurs. Nevertheless, to date, no study investigates thoroughly the effects of such potential synergy on sustainable manufacturing. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, identifying the relation between maintenance processes and I4.0 technologies; then, analysing the positive effects of their integration on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable manufacturing. Finally, a preliminary analysis was also conducted to shed light on the negative effects of this synergy on sustainability.}

Much research on blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 has been conducted from technical, commercial, organizational, and operational perspectives. This paper surveys how blockchain can overcome potential barriers to achieving sustainability from two perspectives, namely, the manufacturing system perspective and the product lifecycle management perspective. The survey first examines literature on these two perspectives, following which the state of research in blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing is presented, which sheds new light on urgent issues as part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We found that blockchain-empowered transformation of a sustainable manufacturing paradigm is still in an early stage of the hype phase, proceeding toward full adoption. The survey ends with a discussion of challenges regarding techniques, social barriers, standards, and regulations with respect to blockchain-empowered manufacturing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and social barriers that blockchain technology must overcome to demonstrate its sustainability in industrial and business spheres.}

Smart manufacturing utilizes rich process data, usually collected by the SMS (e.g., machine tools), to enable accurate tracking and monitoring of individual products throughout the process chain. However, until now, the to-be-manufactured product itself has not contributed to the sensing and compilation of product and process data. More specifically, data measured from the product’s structure during its own fabrication. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the opportunity to actively use the capabilities of smart products within a SMS in terms of technical and economic feasibility. This opportunity emerged only recently with the advancements in smart products engineering. In this research, we developed a smart product prototype and evaluated it on a SMS testbed (CPlab) with eight distinct, fully-connected manufacturing processes. The results of the conducted experiments show the possibility to uniquely identify two distinct ‘fingerprints’ of manufacturing processes solely based on data provided by sensors within the smart product itself. The sensor data was collected directly from the smart product before manufacture was completed, yet after the intended sensor functionality during the product’s use phase was activated. The capability to automatically, accurately, and reliably identify process signatures and even inform the optimization of manufacturing parameters creates new opportunities for improvements in quality, scheduling, and seamless transparency across the whole value chain.}

The ability to predict the need for maintenance of assets at a specific future moment is one of the main challenges in this scope. The possibility of performing predictive maintenance contributes to enhancing machine downtime, costs, control, and quality of production. We observed that surveys and tutorials about Industry 4.0 focus mainly on addressing data analytics and machine learning methods to change production procedures, so not comprising predictive maintenance methods and their organization. In this context, this article presents a systematic literature review of initiatives of predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0, identifying and cataloging methods, standards, and applications. As the main contributions, this survey discusses the current challenges and limitations in predictive maintenance, in addition to proposing a novel taxonomy to classify this research area considering the needs of the Industry 4.0. We concluded that computer science, including artificial intelligence and distributed computing fields, is more and more present in an area where engineering was the dominant expertise, so detaching the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address Industry 4.0 effectively.}

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keywords frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.}

abstract = {Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), machine operators and suppliers are three main stakeholders in today’s industrial asset management lifecycle. Considering high rate of investment and prices to purchase and operationalize secured IoT-based production systems, insurance companies explore contributing into industrial asset management lifecycle by providing new products to transparently monitor online condition and operation status of industrial machines, and accordingly adjust the insurance prices and offers. Hence, joint efforts and cross-disciplinary research is vital to introduce a new insurance product, i.e. failure-based insurance, gaining benefits from AI technologies and knowledge-based maintenance approaches. This paper provides insights into the aforementioned problem, and presents the work-in-progress research on failure-based insurance model aided by Digital Twin technology. Finally, the practical implications and future research directions are outlined.}

abstract = {In a hybrid layout production system under uncertainties, making strategic decisions becomes crucial and demanding, with an increase in the complexity of the system. The advent of Industry 4.0 leads to the development of technologies such as smart factories, simulation, cloud, cyber-physical systems that use digital twins for making informed strategic decisions in a factory. This paper proposes a decision-making framework for a multi-product hybrid layout production system under stochastic disruptions using a simulation model. The simulation model will act as a digital twin of the physical system, which helps to proactively visualize and analyze several key performance parameters of the system and make informed decisions. The objective of this paper is to identify the best sequence from predefined sequences for jobs, which maximize profit, throughput, and minimize cost, and make-span. Several experimentation cases are developed to analyze the performance of the system under different scenarios of disruptions and make strategic decisions such as investing in new machines, prioritizing products, and rescheduling of products.}

Usually, designers in various fields can only design subsystems of an SMS based on the limited cognition of dynamics. Conducting SMS designs concurrently and developing a unified model to effectively imitate every interaction and behavior of manufacturing processes are challenging. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulations to reduce the vast time and cost of physical commissioning/reconfiguration by the early detection of design errors/flaws of the SMS. However, the development of the digital twins concept in the SMS design remains vague. An innovative Function-Structure-Behavior-Control-Intelligence-Performance (FSBCIP) framework is proposed to review how digital twins technologies are integrated into and promote the SMS design based on a literature search in the Web of Science database. The definitions, frameworks, major design steps, new blueprint models, key enabling technologies, design cases, and research directions of digital twins-based SMS design are presented in this survey. It is expected that this survey will shed new light on urgent industrial concerns in developing new SMSs in the Industry 4.0 era.}

abstract = {As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.}

Business is developed on top of Big Data Analytics and revenue is returned with high percentages from events prediction. Since many business areas can benefit from it, Big Data Analytics as a research topic faces multiple challenges. These ones are: fundamental understanding of models, architectures, security, privacy, but also data science and mentality to accommodate big data-driven decisions. This is argued by a series of facts such as: inference from multiple data sources, observation measuring, missing events and surrogate variables, incomplete information. Thus, this chapter aims to present a broad overview of the most common methods and techniques, including processing data platforms, used for analytics applied to large volume of unstructured, semistructured, and structured data coming with high velocity. Moreover, the tutorial character of this material helps to develop some capabilities in analyzing small data, to be followed up with massive amounts of data.}

At present, these controls are prescriptive and pre-determined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic, possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics, data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted building management. This paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the end-user to select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through the spatio-temporal building performance data.}

R&D in Dutch companies and innovation in universities in the Netherlands play an important and active role in this context. In this paper, we provide a general framework for supporting education in the context of Industry 4.0. We adopt the case study of Wageningen University at which we were actively involved in designing and customizing academic courses related to Industry 4.0. Wageningen University, which has the highest rank in the field of Agriculture & Forestry according to influential university rankings and has a rank 59 according to Times Higher Education, is traditionally a life science university but has taken also an active strategy for aligning with the developments in IT and Artificial Intelligence. Apart from the content-wise shift, skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving are addressed by applying project-based evaluations. We discuss the lessons learned and address the issues related to Industry 4.0 and education.}

The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services. This picture calls for future research endeavours to extend the scope of investigation into digital servitization (regarding the technologies covered and their combinatory effect, the potential benefits, and the application domains) and to develop models and frameworks to support decision-making by practitioners.}

This paper presents an inductive study of the “why” and “how” of BC-IoT systems through a Systematic Literature Review of 120 peer-reviewed studies. To capture the diverse nature of BC-IoT integration, we proposed and applied a multi-perspective framework to analyse the existing systems. Regarding their motivations, we studied the improvement objectives and technical problems that drive the integration of BC. Regarding the design, we captured the position of BC within IoT systems as well as the content and processes that IoT systems offload to BC. As these dimensions are not mutually exclusive, they constitute a rich and multi-angle view of BC-IoT integration. Based on these findings, we defined 10 archetypes of BC-IoT systems that embody the core patterns of usage and configuration of BC in IoT systems.}

Incorporation of digital twin into the paradigm of existing data-driven smart customisation will make the process more responsive, adaptable and predictive.

Therefore, scalable methods for verifying security properties of manufacturing systems are paramount. This paper presents an approach to guarantee security of C2PS using concepts from Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to describe the security properties of cloud constructs. We prove that composability is an essential property for enhancing the security of the C2PS. Furthermore, it also provides good scalability to the system. We propose formalisms required for modelling security properties in the Industrial IoT-based manufacturing system. Using this formalism and Hoares’ logic we provide conditions for composing systems. Finally, we provide strong authentication conditions among entity pairs in C2PS based manufacturing systems. We demonstrate the message exchanges, methodology, and different steps required for verifying C2PS.}

First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a network of interfaces between the environments is designed and implemented to enable communication between the digital world and physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel combination between data science and manufacturing industries.}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.}

abstract = {Today’s digital world and evolving technology has improved the quality of our lives but it has also come with a number of new threats. In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.}

Automating the process of capturing data from industrial machines, analyzing it and using the knowledge gained to make better decisions for the machines is the crux of the digital twin. Sensor technology, Internet of Things platforms, information and communication technology and smart analytics allow the digital twin to transform a physical asset into a connected smart item that is now part of a cyber physical system and that is far more valuable than when it existed in isolation. The digital twin can be adopted by the maintenance engineering industry to aid in the prediction of issues before they occur thus creating value for the business. In this paper the authors look to introduce a maintenance digital twin to a large-scale manufacturing facility. Issues that hamper such work are discovered and categorized to highlight the difficulty of the practical installation of this concept. To aid in the installation process a digital twin framework is presented that simplifies the digital twin development process into steps that can be completed independently.

abstract = {Data and object connectivity are the key and the critical component of industry 4.0, Connectivity of software, equipment, data ... are all massive data to be processed. Combined with cybersecurity, they become fundamental elements for creating intelligence in an industrial system that can increase the flexibility of production in addition to allocating resources more efficiently. In order to successfully transition to ecosystem 4.0, the industry must examine the new skills that are required and the need for qualified personnel. The fourth industrial revolution corresponds to the widespread use of sensors and intelligent agents to connect machines, components, processes and operators. This is generally called the digital factory or industry 4.0. It suggests a global system of effective communication between the modules of decision-making. World 4.0 will allow interaction between products, machines and even between machines (M2M). The product will also be able to communicate with machines in the production phase. This is called intelligent production, which will allow the modification and customization of products in their production phase. In this article, we present a communication model based on Modbus and multiband communication using NB-IOT, this communication model allows data to be exchanged between different industrial equipment (PLCs, SCADA systems, etc.) via MODBUS RTU and ASCII, via RS485, or via analog and digital inputs for sensors and actuators.}

abstract = {A new emerging frontier in the evolution of the digitalisation and the 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is considered to be that of “Biologicalisation in Manufacturing”. This has been defined by the authors to be “The use and integration of biological and bio-inspired principles, materials, functions, structures and resources for intelligent and sustainable manufacturing technologies and systems with the aim of achieving their full potential.” In this White Paper, detailed consideration is given to the meaning and implications of “Biologicalisation” from the perspective of the design, function and operation of products, manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, supply chains and organisations. The drivers and influencing factors are also reviewed in detail and in the context of significant developments in materials science and engineering. The paper attempts to test the hypothesis of this topic as a breaking new frontier and to provide a vision for the development of manufacturing science and technology from the perspective of incorporating inspiration from biological systems. Seven recommendations are delivered aimed at policy makers, at funding agencies, at the manufacturing research community and at those industries involved in the development of next generation manufacturing technology and systems. It is concluded that it is valid to argue that Biologicalisation in Manufacturing truly represents a new and breaking frontier of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 and that the market potential is very strong. It is evident that extensive research and development is required in order to maximise on the benefits of a biological transformation.}

Industry 4.0 literature is growing exponentially, overexpanding the current understanding of the digital industrial revolution through thousands of academic publications. This unprecedented growth calls for a systematic review of the concept, scope, definition, and functionality of Industry 4.0. Such systematic review should address the existing ambiguities and deliver a clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of this phenomenon, including the possible implications for sustainability. Consistently, the present study carried out a systematic literature review of related articles, published online within the Industry 4.0 discipline until November 2020. The systematic literature review identified 745 eligible articles and applied extensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis methodically. The study provides a descriptive assessment of eligible articles’ properties and offers a unified conceptualization of Industry 4.0 and the underlying building blocks. The study explains how the implications of Industry 4.0 for value creation expand beyond the manufacturing industry. The study further describes the sustainability value drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and identifies the conditions on which digital industrial transformation success lays. Overall, findings reveal that Industry 4.0 transformation could address pressing issues of sustainable development goals, particularly concerning the manufacturing-economic development. The study also draws on the findings and offers important theoretical and practical implications, highlights the existing gaps within the literature, and discusses the possible future research directions.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.}

abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, machines and devices are increasingly getting connected. These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices’ known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.}

This work reveals that too much research attention was invested in making data-driven models, as supposed to ensuring the quality of industrial data. Furthermore, the true challenge within the Industry 4.0 is with data communication and infrastructure problems, not so significantly on developing modelling techniques. Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry. Foreseeing some potential challenges, this paper also discusses the importance of symbiosis between researchers and industrialists to transition from traditional industry towards a digital twin-based energy-saving industry. The novelty of this work is the current context of industrial energy savings was extended towards cutting-edge technologies for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this work proposes to standardize and modularize industrial data infrastructure for smart energy savings. This work also serves as a concise guideline for researchers and industrialists who are looking to implement advanced energy-saving systems.}

The emergence of the concept of Cyber Physical System (CPS) and big data imperatively enable manufacturing to become smarter and more competitive among nations. Many researchers have proposed new solutions with big data enabling tools for manufacturing applications in three directions: product, production and business. Big data has been a fast-changing research area with many new opportunities for applications in manufacturing. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of big data in manufacturing. Six key drivers of big data applications in manufacturing have been identified. The key drivers are system integration, data, prediction, sustainability, resource sharing and hardware. Based on the requirements of manufacturing, nine essential components of big data ecosystem are captured. They are data ingestion, storage, computing, analytics, visualization, management, workflow, infrastructure and security. Several research domains are identified that are driven by available capabilities of big data ecosystem. Five future directions of big data applications in manufacturing are presented from modelling and simulation to real-time big data analytics and cybersecurity.}

The main attraction of the concept relies in the fact that it encompasses many scientific topics that were distinct before. The downside is the lack of readability of the current developments about cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). Indeed, the large scientific area of CPPS makes it difficult to identify clearly and rapidly, in the various applications that were made of CPPS, what are the choices, best practices and methodology that are suggested and that could be used for a new application. This work intends to introduce an analysis framework able to classify those developments. An extensive study of literature enabled to extract the major criteria that are to be used in the framework, namely: Development Extent; Research Axis; Instrumenting; Communication standards; Intelligence deposit; Cognition level; Human factor. Several recent examples of CPPS developments in literature are used to illustrate the use of the framework and brief conclusions are drawn from the comparative analysis of those examples.}

abstract = {As manufacturing industry is moving its steps towards a more digital, smart and flexible scenario, the changes required to achieve the expectations of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) framework are numerous and extensive. Though, a general lack of understanding of how new technologies could be integrated and shall be implemented is present, limiting the rate of adoption of such changes and the related beneficial impacts. This paper describes the implementation of a smart-factory at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) aiming at filling the gap in I4.0 related skills development thorough a learning by doing approach, and providing a research platform that could foster collaboration of practitioners and academia on the development and testing of new technologies. The developed factory integrates different production technologies such as additive manufacturing, laser processing and milling, in order to produce a highly customizable item consisting in a TANGRAM game-set, packaged into personalized boxes. The entire factory is coupled with its digital twin, which is fed by an exhaustive monitoring infrastructure composed by vision systems and high precision measurement instruments, allowing to track in real time plant processes. The design has been carried out in order to make the smart factory serving as a mean to face both educational and research challenges at many different levels. As an educational mean, students and professionals have the chance to dive into manufacturing history experiencing both classical automation topics (PLC, MES and SCADA programming, precision axes control and pneumatics), as well as more advanced technologies, typical of the most advanced smart-factories (IoT, vision systems, simulation and digital twin, advanced measuring methods and smart production management systems). From a research point of view, the factory functions as a pilot plant for internal research and applied industrial projects, on the top of which applications, manufacturing methods and technologies are developed, tested and integrated.}

abstract = {In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of life including smart homes, smart cities, agriculture, offices, and workplaces. Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.}

In particular, maintenance is one of the most researched applications, as the impact of the execution of maintenance task may have a great impact in the business of the companies. For example, in sector such as energy or manufacturing, a maintenance activity can cause the shutdown of an entire production line, or in the case of a wind turbine inspection, may face the safety of an operator to measure a simple indicator. Hence, the application of more intelligent maintenance strategies can offer huge benefits. In this context, this paper focuses on the review of DT applications for maintenance, as no previous work has been found with this aim. For instance, both “Digital Twin” and “maintenance” concepts and strategies are described in detail, and then a literature review is carried out where these two concepts are involved. In addition to identifying and analyzing how DTs are currently being applied for maintenance, this paper also highlights future research lines and open issues.}

Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes. Finally, the scope of future research is discussed in detail.}

The US government launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) in 2011 and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in 2014. Most recently, the Manufacturing USA initiative was officially rolled out to further “leverage existing resources... to nurture manufacturing innovation and accelerate commercialization” by fostering close collaboration between industry, academia, and government partners. In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed. Challenges are addressed with applications that are based on commercially available platforms such as General Electric (GE)’s Predix and PTC’s ThingWorx.}

A limited number of researchers consider integrating process measurements. However, in complex systems, process variable changes could result from different combinations of abnormal occurrences. This paper examines recent advances in intrusion detection algorithms, their limitations, challenges and the status of their application in critical infrastructures. We also introduce the discussion on the similarities and conflicts observed in the development of machine learning tools and techniques for fault diagnosis and cybersecurity in the protection of complex systems and the need to establish a clear difference between them. As a case study, we discuss special characteristics in nuclear power control systems and the factors that constraint the direct integration of security algorithms.

As digitally enabled manufacturing machines continue to grow exponentially, it becomes imperative to uniquely and securely identify them in the cyber-physical world, particularly in defense, biomedical, energy and aerospace manufacturing. Research about threats originating from internal adversaries’ i.e the machine/organization owner within a tiered digitally connected supply chain is scarce. This paper introduces a machine fingerprinting scheme named as the ‘Witness Box Protocol’ (WBP) that exploits the physical properties of manufacturing machines (legacy or smart) and their surroundings to create a unique biometric like fingerprint. WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. In this research, fingerprints were randomly generated from the statistical features of signals from 3D printers and CNC machine in a production-like lab environment. Using k-means clustering and Jaccard similarity index, these fingerprints are shown to identify the source equipment with 95 % accuracy.}

Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Technologies, manufacturing industries are witnessing the fourth Industrial Revolution, coined as Industrie 4.0 (I4.0). Although many studies related to this subject were published, including several literature reviews, there is no consensual definition of I4.0. Consequently, there is not a clear understanding of the underlying enabling technologies required to implement it. That makes it more difficult for players to plan a migration strategy. This paper proposes a technological pathway infrastructure from Industry 3.0 (I3.0) to I4.0, based on the analysis of research and academic involvement in this transition process. A bibliometric study was directed to academic work, while field research addressed industry practitioners. The purpose of field research is to understand the impact of the knowledge about the transition from I3.0 up to I4.0. The contribution of this study includes a construct showing the fundamental technology infrastructure to pave the way from I3.0 up to I4.0. Furthermore, it reveals the transition of manufacturing paradigm from I3.0 complex, centralized, monolithic architecture and physical Supply Chain to a modular, distributed, collaborative, and product-service-oriented I4.0 architecture.}

This systematic and thematic review provides a detailed analysis of I4.0-related requirements in terms of MES functionalities and an overview of MES development methods and standards because these three aspects are essential in developing MESs. The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development. The observed trends show that formal models and ontologies will play an even more essential role in I4.0 systems as interoperability becomes more of a focus and that the new generation of linkable data sources should be based on semantically enriched information. The presented overview can serve as a guide for engineers interested in the development of MESs as well as for researchers interested in finding worthwhile areas of research.}

In such domain, the search for “agility” has come to be one of the most requested features. As a result, considerable research has been conducted to design manufacturing systems which embody manufacturing flexibility. It is in this context where the evolution of the supply-chain based concept of Mini Factories is relevant, as it allows a network-like interconnectivity between assets by setting up factories inside the premises of the principal manufacturer. It is stated that at the core of Industry 4.0 implementation, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the bridge between the physical world and the IoT world or, in other words, the data model from where the digital twin stems from. In this paper we present a methodology to create Asset Administrative Shells in a Mini Factories context. We argue that our approach, effectively embodies concepts related to Industry 4.0 in a modular way, allowing the much-desired agility. By using our proposed methodology, Model Factory @ARTC has been able to create a seamless integration of assets into our factory of the future, demonstrating the connectivity and some of the enhanced capabilities of Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {Smart-Manufacturing systems are increasingly being used to perform complex tasks on the factory floor. Most often, these systems have hard-coded cases to achieve a specific set of actions -or to assure the safety of the operations. The hard-coding makes the use complicated to re-deploy a system for different tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to have a flexible framework, which can generate a plan based on an intuitive description with system constraints, while satisfying all safety conditions. In this work, we propose Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)-based autonomy framework for smart-manufacturing systems. Specifically, we describe a general technique for formulating problems using LTL specifications. The use of LTL enables us to specify a manufacturing scenario (e.g. assembly), along with system constraints, as well as assured autonomy. Based on the given LTL formulation, a safe solution satisfying all constraints can be generated using a satisfiability solver. To eliminate the exhaustive and exponential nature of the solver, we reduced the exploration space with a divide and conquer approach in a receding horizon, which brings dramatic improvements in time and enables our solution for real-world applications. Our experimental evaluations indicated that our solution scales linearly as the problem complexity increases. We showcased the feasibility of our approach by integrating TLbased autonomy with the simulations of Gantry robot in Siemens NX Mechatronics Concept Designer and TIA Portal (PLCSIM Advanced) for Siemens S7-1500 TCPU connected to Sinamics drives.}

Going beyond simply the automation of manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 involves the convergence of information and automation technology to create cyber-physical systems which virtualize and optimise the manufacturing process on a global scale. The traditional unidisciplinary or multidisciplinary engineering approach has been extremely successful for the provision of Mechatronics Engineers for Industry 3.0 over the past decades. But the complexities of the cyber physical systems which must be implemented as part of Industry 4.0 require a much more comprehensive systems engineering approach. This has resulted in the requirement for the new occupation of Equipment Systems Engineers (ESE) who have been introduced to, and are capable of utilizing an interdisciplinary or even anti-disciplinary approach. This paper describes the development and implementation of an Industry-Led Masters programme at the University of Limerick which was designed specifically to meet the unique skillset required for this rapidly developing field. The development of a unique Industry 4.0 teaching space is described as well as the creation of three manufacturing cells and their ‘digital twins’ which recreate the environment found in the field. They allow Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies to be used to interact remotely with the equipment. Close collaboration with Industry Experts is a strong feature of the design and delivery of the programme. The teaching methods were also novel and an implementation of the CDIO method is described. The programme recently received the award of ‘Best New Masters Programme’ in a field of competitors across all Irish Universities and disciplines.}

Second, the prototype of a Service-oriented Digital Twin, which leverage on a flexible ontology-oriented knowledge structure and on augmented reality combined to a vocal interaction system for an intuitive knowledge retrieval and fruition, has been designed and developed to deliver this manufacturing knowledge. Two test-beds, complimentary for the problems in practice (the former on the maintenance-production interface in a large enterprise, the latter majorly focused in production and setups in a small and medium enterprise), show the significant benefits in terms of time, costs and process quality, thus validating the approach proposed.

abstract = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

Besides technical and organisational issues, standardization, in the context of next generation manufacturing systems, is a topic requiring better study. In this article we offer an analysis of relevant standards for manufacturing systems which was performed for the Digital Manufacturing Platforms (4DMP) cluster in order to identify those standards that might be relevant for ZDM, as well as for further projects or manufacturing platform designers. The standards covered by this work are aligned with the RAMI 4.0 reference model in order to simplify the design process by interlinking standards with relevant model layers and thus contribute to system's interoperability.}

Safety-critical systems, such as planes, are at risk because cyber-information cannot be provably tied to a specific physical part instance (e.g., impeller). This paper presents promising initial work showing that using piezoelectric sensors to measure impedance identities of parts may serve as a physically unclonable function that can produce unclonable part instance identities. When one of these impedance identities is combined with cyber-information and signed using existing public key infrastructure approaches, it creates a provable binding of cyber-information to a specific part instance. Our initial results from experimentation with traditionally and additively manufactured parts indicate that it will be extremely expensive and improbable for an attacker to counterfeit a part that replicates the impedance signature of a legitimate part.}

In respect to its practical world applications, the IoT has the prospect of entirely transforming the pharma industry by facilitating and mechanizing the isolated nursing of patients, the innovation of different types of drugs, their admittance, and much more. The combination of the IoT with the growing digitization of figures in the pharma segment has led to a new direction and opened the floodgates for enormous changes and industrial scale innovations. While striving for ingenious inventions, the software needs to keep pace. As previously observed, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are providing tremendous opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry. Similarly, the IoT offers pharma production with an assortment of innovative prospects, such as an improved mechanism for drug trade and better analytical tools. Now the question is how can the IoT be used to benefit the pharmaceutical industry? The answer is that IoT sensors and detectors can help in enabling the optimal circumstances for supervising different styles of biomaterials and chemicals, detecting tool flaws, and it can be also used to assist in the prevention of fraudulent drug activities. People who are involved in industries like pharmaceuticals work in a risk-prone industry where they must avoid asset failures at any cost, as making mistakes is unacceptable because quality control has a direct impact on the health of the consumer and there should be no opportunities for errors to be made. There are a variety of problems that may arise in plants during the manufacture of drugs, such as wear and tear of equipment with time, corrosion, excessive voltage, and destruction caused by the chemicals used. Keeping a proper track of all these risks is crucial to meet the desired quality of the drug, hence a number of sensors are used for the assimilation of enormous amounts of data from different departments that help in managing, controlling, and supervising everything that takes place, initiating a sequence response for better efficacy and control, which will eventually reduce the production cost, minimize waste, and allow for better control.}

First, a development method for OPC UA-based CPMT is proposed based on a generic OPC UA information model for CNC machine tools. Second, to address the issue of interoperability between OPC UA and MTConnect, an MTConnect to OPC UA interface is developed to transform MTConnect information model and its data to their OPC UA counterparts. An OPC UA-based CPMT prototype is developed and further integrated with a previously developed MTConnect-based CPMT to establish a common CPMT Platform. Third, different applications are developed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CPMT Platform, including an OPC UA Client, an advanced AR-assisted wearable Human-Machine Interface and a conceptual framework for CPMT powered cloud manufacturing environment. Experimental results have proven that the proposed CPMT Platform can significantly improve the overall production efficiency and effectiveness in the shop floor.}

In current cyber-physical systems, data are collected from pieces of manufacturing equipment and used to drive useful change and affect production output. The data gathered typically describe the operating state of the equipment, such as a machine tool, and can be provided using standard protocols. One such protocol, known as MTConnect, is becoming increasingly popular to collect data from machine tools. Other useful data can be collected from production personnel using a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to monitor process output, consumable usage, and operator productivity. However, MTConnect data and MES data usually reside in separate systems that may be proprietary and expensive. This paper describes the development and implementation of a new MES, powered by Android devices and cloud computing tools, that combines MTConnect data with production data collected from operators; the proposed MES is particularly suitable for small manufacturing enterprises, as it is low-cost and easily implementable. A case study using the MES to track a production run of titanium parts is presented, and data from the MES are correlated with MTConnect data from a machine tool. This work is integral to realizing a complete digital model of the shop floor, known as the Shop Floor Digital Twin, that can be used for production control and optimization.}

The ID study considers the elements of the Industry 4.0 (I4) such as autonomous robots, advanced analytics, systems integration, high-end sensing, big data, internet of things, cloud computing and human-machine interactions. Toward achievable I4-based production, the proposed IDoI4 (ID-of-I4) approach integrates I4 fundamental elements regarding a) modelling and solution algorithms (MSA), b) information and communication technologies (ICT), c) high-performance computing (HPC), and d) mechatronics (MEC). These four groups of the I4 elements are examined in the industrial cases covering from mature industries to laboratory level systems to determine their current technological states and gaps into the I4 stage. The examples highlighted are crushed-ore stockpile level control in the mining field, resin bed cleaning timetabling in water demineralisation treatment, compositional data-driven real-time optimisation of hydrocarbon streams and diverse I4 basics in the next generation of biorefineries. In the main example, supported by a high-end sensing apparatus to measure crushed-ore stockpile levels in real-time (live inventory as a controlled variable by a target), a hybrid dynamic control prescribes (every 4 minutes) discrete positions and time-slots of the shuttle-conveyor tripper car mechatronics that creates the stockpiles. From such IDoI4 methodology, a table on the MSA, ICT, HPC and MEC ground bases summarises how such technologies are integrated to the industrial examples considering research, development and deployment in stable, demanded and highly demanded stages of the technologies into the I4 mandate.}

However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 has been identified as a major contributor to the era of digitalisation. Its implications for sustainable development have gained widespread attention from the perspectives of the triple bottom line, sustainable business models and circular economy. The purpose of this paper is to map the broad field of sustainable development and investigate the key research areas which comprises the aforementioned perspectives under Industry 4.0 framework. A systematic mapping review was conducted by searching five databases for relevant literature published between January 1, 2012 and April 17, 2020. The search yielded 4291 papers of which 81 were identified as primary papers relevant to the research herein. The primary findings are that the majority of sustainability research focuses on conceptual analysis, and the Internet of Things is dominantly cited with an emphasis on achieving the triple bottom line benefits. Sustainable development in the Industry 4.0 context contributes to circular economic objectives by achieving social, economic, and environmental benefits. Triple bottom line studies mainly focus on Industry 4.0 adoption and implementation, sustainable supply chains, smart and sustainable cities, and smart factories. Circular economy and sustainable business models as emerging research themes that focus on Industry 4.0 adoption and implementation, as well as sustainable supply chains. Our analysis consolidates emerging research patterns areas in both the Industry 4.0 and sustainability literature. Furthermore, it identifies salient research gaps and suggests future research.}

abstract = {This article identifies the advances, advantages, limitations, requirements and current methodologies in implementing the strategic Industry 4.0 (I4.0) initiative. It focuses on all research works mainly on production planning. To do so, it proposes a taxonomy of the principles of I4.0 design terms that contemplates the following classification aspects: interconnection/connectivity, decentralised decision making, technical assistance, the human factor, intelligence/awareness, interoperability, information transparency, technology, organisation, conceptual frameworks and production planning. It also presents the models, algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics of the components used in relation to an I4.0 setting. Finally, a considerable number of reference conceptual frameworks is analysed, which allow the term I4.0 to be defined.}

abstract = {The impact of barriers and incentives on the relationship between openness to Industry 4.0 and performance have so far received little scholarly attention. As a result, this paper explores this relationship by employing a mixed methods approach. A qualitative analysis using in-depth interviews and multiple case studies identifies prominent barriers and incentives, whilst a quantitative analysis on a representative sample of 500 local manufacturing units in Piedmont (a region of Northern Italy) is undertaken via an OLS regression-based path analysis. The results of the parallel-serial multiple mediation model show that: (1) greater openness to Industry 4.0 is related to better performance; (2) greater openness to Industry 4.0 leads to a higher perception of barriers; (3) greater knowledge-related and economic and financial barriers improve performance, abstracting from the adoption of incentives; and (4) greater openness to Industry 4.0 drives the adoption of incentives. However, perceived economic and financial barriers are found not to drive firms to adopt more incentives. The study contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying previously unidentified strengths and weaknesses to barriers and incentives, and highlights the necessity of policies that reflect real firms’ needs.}

abstract = {To make production more competitive, the new factories need to be built according to the guidelines of smart factories. The existing literature describes different approaches how to plan and design the smart factories. Therefore, the paper presents a step-by-step methodology for efficient planning of smart factory from the initial idea to the final realization in the real environment. The methodology includes eight crucial steps, which covers organizing the workshops in the company, explaining terms and definitions commonly used for smart factories, analysing and defining the employee's competences and the technological level of the company, analysing the possibilities of integration of smart I4.0 technologies, developing of digital twins at different levels, designing the visualization and finally building the smart factory in a real environment. The methodology is designed according to the needs of several partners and manufacturers, which are collaborating within the various European projects related to the smart factories.}
