abstract = {Blockchain technology is used adeptly to simplify the complex and fragmented processes present in the transportation system like mobility-as-a-service and supply chain management. Companies across the trucking industry have integrated blockchain in transportation and mobility service. A blockchain is a distributed, digital ledger that records transactions in a series of blocks. It exists in multiple copies spread over multiple computers, and track all the records of the system. It records transactions, tracks assets, and creates a transparent and efficient system to manage all documents involved in the transportation system. In this chapter, we have described the role of blockchain in the transportation system in terms of mobility-as-a-service and supply chain management.}

Practice-orientation refers to efforts that have resulted in positive impact and transformations in the delivery of healthcare. The review is epochal in the sense that there have been 3 major stages of innovation and diffusion in digital health that are identified. The year 1998 was deemed a significant starting point for the literature search because it marked the introduction of the term e-health. The main objective of this review is to track the evolution of digital health and the conspicuous developments in the field - crucial steps to get a grasp of the key issues involving the delivery of healthcare. The article includes a general discussion of these various key issues and sensitizing concepts. The sense-making thus shed some light on the areas of enquiry, which are central to identifying the direction in which the practice of healthcare is headed. These areas of enquiry often referred to as ‘substantive areas’ in qualitative research terminology, were identified as ‘electronic medical records’, ‘health cloud’, ‘data analytics’, ‘Internet-enabled devices’, and other ‘emerging information technologies’. The article concludes with a synthesis of key inferences drawn from the epochal review. The digital disruption of healthcare has created necessary conditions for its offering as a global, interoperable service.}

The role of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are exploited in the IIoT environment to ensure effective management and computing resource utilization. Based on the SDN and NFV paradigms, this article introduces a novel elastic computing resource virtualization (ECRV) method to improve the flexibility of resource management in the IIoT. The need for virtualization is obtained by identifying the control and process platforms used in industrial task management. Support vector machine-based classification learning is used to achieve balanced identification, and prevents unnecessary distribution of limited resources, Support vector machine helps to retain flexibility in task control processes that use available industrial resources. By separating the process and control platforms, service dissemination is improved and backlogs in task processing are decreased. The proposed method could provide flexible virtualization and reduces the service response time and task failure.}

These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.}

Traceability and trackability of data ensure the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part’s life cycle, leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.}

abstract = {E-commerce logistics real estate (EcLRE) is on the rise with the rapid development of logistics industry and continuous prosperity of real estate. The profit model for EcLRE is moving towards offering professional logistics services instead of simple real estate leasing. As the attributes for real estate are definite and difficult to change, the improvement of logistics service becomes necessity for EcLRE service providers to gain competitiveness in the market. However, the heterogeneous requirements from different service demanders place great challenges for the EcLRE service providers. The most puzzled one is to prevent fragmentation of logistics resources to serve different demanders (customers). This phenomenon of resource fragmentation is aggravated by the implementation of demanders’ (customers’) own information technologies or management requirements. To achieve the central management of logistics resources to serve heterogeneous demanders becomes an imperative requirement for EcLRE service provider. Therefore, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled workflow operating system (Bc-WfOS) to centrally share heterogeneous logistics resources with different customers. Three key innovative technologies are involved to empower Bc-WfOS. The first one is gateway technology introduced to realize the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of heterogeneous logistics resources. Secondly, to effectively and efficiently coordinate logistics resources, a multi-dimensional workflow model is proposed with corresponding workflow operation mechanism to suit different business logic. Additionally, a resource blockchain is designed with the integration of blockchain technology with agent technology to guarantee the data reliability to provide accurate front-line resource execution data for different customers to conduct higher decision-makings. Aiming at verifying the proposed Bc-WfOS, a prototype system is also developed and implemented in laboratory environment for conducting experimental case studies based on a real-life case.}

AI refers to analytical methods in the execution of certain tasks, which can replace human intelligence. AI helps computers to learn from experience, adapts to new inputs, and performs tasks of a human nature. From research labs to your living room, AI now lives everywhere. AI has already taken jobs from humans and will continue to do so as it becomes wider and more successful. On the other hand, the IoT is a network of various devices that are linked over the internet and that can capture and exchange data among themselves. IoT helps the devices/objects to observe, identify, and understand a situation or environment without being dependent on human assistance. From everyday objects like kitchen appliances, vehicles, thermostats, and baby monitors to everything else is connected to the Internet through embedded devices.}

Further, to tackle such circumstances, conformation to quality has become a must in Agriculture Supply Chain (ASC). Agro-stakeholders have tried to accomplish this demand through the integration of technology in ASC. One such technology is blockchain, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India. Fueled by this motivation, we aim to investigate the significant barriers for blockchain adoption in Indian ASC. The constructs are identified through a comprehensive literature search and opinion of domain experts from five agro-organizations, academia, and agro-stakeholders. Further identified construct is modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL approach, which not only interrogates interrelationship amongst identified constructs but also evaluates the intensity of the relationship between them. The identified constructs are also clustered into a suitable group using Fuzzy-MICMAC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. The results reveal that “lack of government regulation and lack of trust among agro-stakeholder to use blockchain” are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Indian ASC. Moreover, the managerial implication about the results is also provided, which will be useful to government and related agencies to take suitable measures to overcome these obstacles for increasing the rate of blockchain adoption in Indian ASC.}

However, the distrust between stakeholders and the platform (distrust among collaborators and the doubts of data accuracy) hinders the development of it. Manufacturing service that are mainly encapsulated by static information cannot well adapt to changing physical conditions, which will disappoint the stakeholders for data accuracy. In addition, distrust among unfamiliar stakeholders is also the reason to keep users away from the platform. Digital twin (DT) and blockchain (BC) technologies have been widely studied in many fields, as they can provide a trustful method for the process of cyber-physical integration. In view of the insufficient interaction of physical and cyber spaces and distrust challenges encountered in the development of the current Industrial Internet platform based manufacturing service collaboration, this paper proposes a DT-BC enhanced manufacturing service collaboration mechanism towards the Industrial Internet platform.

Advances in technology such as blockchain technology can help facilitate effective management of sustainable supply chain visibility and in delivering associated benefits. The relational characteristics of blockchain and sustainable supply chain visibility has recently been reported in the literature with some emphasis on the capacity, capability and context of sustainable supply chain visibility. This paper explores a notion of context-awareness and blockchain in relation to sustainable supply chain visibility. A landscape for an architecture of a blockchain-based sustainable supply chain visibility management platform centred on context-awareness is suggested. The main thrust of the considerations is provisioning of secure, auditable and mutually benefiting sustainable supply chain information sharing, for distinctive visibility, in heterogeneous context-aware scenarios whilst recognising the underlying characteristics of sustainable supply chain visibility.}

The main focus of these approaches is the feasibility of different applications. It is usually simply assumed that data in a blockchain is stored immutably. However, the path from data generation to entry into a blockchain is usually neglected. Exactly this topic is discussed in this paper and a solution proposal for a secure data flow from the machine to the blockchain is presented. For this, the hardware and software architecture of the solution is shown, followed by measurements of the operational capability of the solution.}

An intelligent battery management system is a crucial enabler for energy storage systems with high power output, increased safety and long lifetimes. With recent developments in cloud computing and the proliferation of big data, machine learning approaches have begun to deliver invaluable insights, which drives adaptive control of battery management systems (BMS) with improved performance. In this paper, a general framework utilizing an end-edge-cloud architecture for a cloud-based BMS is proposed, with the composition and function of each link described. Cloud-based BMS leverages from the Cyber Hierarchy and Interactional Network (CHAIN) framework to provide multi-scale insights, more advanced and efficient algorithms can be used to realize the state-of-X estimation, thermal management, cell balancing, fault diagnosis and other functions of traditional BMS system. The battery intelligent monitoring and management platform can visually present battery performance, store working-data to help in-depth understanding of the microscopic evolutionary law, and provide support for the development of control strategies. Currently, the cloud-based BMS requires more effects on the multi-scale integrated modeling methods and remote upgrading capability of the controller, these two aspects are very important for the precise management and online upgrade of the system. The utility of this approach is highlighted not only for automotive applications, but for any battery energy storage system, providing a holistic framework for future intelligent and connected battery management.}

In order to be able to link and use such heterogeneous data, spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities can play an important role in establishing interoperability between systems and platforms. Based on the open and international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Smart District Data Infrastructure (SDDI) concept integrates different sensors, IoT devices, simulation tools, and 3D city models within a common operational framework. However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. Also, there are various users and applications who prefer to work with all the systems in convenient ways using Single-Sign-On. This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration. Such access control and security federation based realization has not been considered in spatial data infrastructures for Smart Cities before.}

We look at concepts which have been presented by researchers in the past, e.g. device or OS fingerprinting, biometrical respectively hylemetrical methods and self-description abilities of CPPS components. We propose how they can be used to construct a hybrid fingerprint for CPPS, to increase security and build a secure identity for CPPS.}

At present, these controls are prescriptive and pre-determined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic, possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics, data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted building management. This paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the end-user to select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through the spatio-temporal building performance data.}

abstract = {This paper provides a review of research into using Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality(MR) for remote collaboration on physical tasks. AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. This work will be useful for current and future researchers who are interested in collaborative AR/MR systems.}

This positioning paper responds to practical business needs of organisations and project teams, builds upon existing conceptual constructs, and delivers a modular information management framework. The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components - information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers – which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes – and aims to predict - information flows across an asset's lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.}

However, current verification mechanisms cannot verify the correctness of search results for semantically related queries in mutual distrust scenarios. Moreover, most secure semantic searching schemes still perform exact matching on ciphertext after query expansion, then directly accumulate the weights of the matched keywords as similarity measurements to rank the documents, resulting in the search results with unsatisfied ranking. In this paper, we propose a secure heuristic semantic searching scheme, in which a privacy-preserving word nonlinear matching (PPWNM) method is developed, and a blockchain-based verification is designed to obtain trustworthy search results with high retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we describe several retrieval heuristics and formulate them as a word nonlinear matching problem, then transform it to the PPWNM problem for calculating the similarity measurement between the query and document so that the highly accurate ranked results can be obtained. Also we design a blockchain-based verification mechanism in which the blockchain nodes utilize the proofs generated during the matching process to verify the correctness of the search results and reach a consensus to ensure the trustworthy results and fair payment between the participants in a mutual distrust model. Our security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is secure and has higher accuracy compared with the existing other schemes.}

This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law.

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is the new industrial revolution involving the introduction of new technologies in the industrial field. However, changing the technological level of an outdated industry is not a simple task. By retrofitting all old equipment into new equipment in industries, the retrofitting concept emerges as a rapid and low-cost solution, aimed at reusing existing equipment, with the addition of new technologies. However, retrofitting changes according to the type and model of industrial equipment, making it challenging to upgrade industrial equipment to Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). In this paper, the standardization of the retrofitting process to transform old equipment into a CPPS is presented. The standardization is done with the support of a platform that has features to work independently of the model or type of equipment. To implement the platform, we define the requirements, components, and technologies necessary to retrofit industrial equipment. The entire process is based on Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) a widespread architecture of Industry 4.0. With the retrofitting platform based on RAMI 4.0, makes consistent the process of upgrading industrial equipment, providing Industry 4.0 functionality. A prototype with an industrial robotic arm was implemented to validate the process and the retrofitting platform. The results show the benefits of the CPPS Retrofitting process in industrial equipment.}

The proposed algorithm enables independent power grid nodes, without prior trust on each other, to reach an agreement on the Optimal Power Flow solution. We decompose the Optimal Power Flow problem using a blockchain-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers and we comment on efficiency, trust, security and transparency issues. The successive iterants of the solution of the power flow problem are securely stored on the blockchain, removing the need for a central operating authority, while allowing network nodes to verify the validity and optimality of the solution. We illustrate the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm presented through simulation experiments on the 39-bus New England transmission system, and IEEE-57 and IEEE-118 benchmark systems. We systematically compare the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with well established blockchain consensus algorithms. The results show that our method maintains the convergence characteristics of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers iterative scheme and enables independent network nodes to reach consensus.}

Previous research efforts on addressing the bottlenecks primarily emphasize on the analysis of data from the physical job-shop, but with little connection and convergence with its virtual models and simulated data. By introducing digital twin (DT), further convergence between physical and virtual spaces of the job-shop can be achieved, which greatly enables dynamic scheduling. DT fuses both real and simulated data to provide more information for the prediction of machine availability on one hand; and on the other hand, it helps to detect disturbances through comparing the physical machine with its continuously updated digital counterpart in real time, triggering timely rescheduling when needed. It also enables comprehensive performance evaluation for rescheduling using multiple-dimension models, which can describe geometric properties, physics parameters and behaviors of the machines. In the paper, a five-dimension DT for a machine in the job-shop is introduced first, then the DT-based machine availability prediction, disturbance detection and performance evaluation methods are explored. Based on this, a DT-enhanced dynamic scheduling methodology is proposed. A scheduling process of making hydraulic valves in a machining job-shop is taken as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.}

The digital transformation has reshaped the manufacturing industries and has paved the way towards data-driven, intelligent, networked, and resilient manufacturing systems. In this context, Industry 4.0 is progressing exponentially and offers a productive output in terms of circular economy and cleaner production to attain ethical business by achieving accuracy, precision, and efficiency. Hence, there is a strong requirement to revamp the traditional manufacturing set-ups into smart manufacturing to gain self-adaptability, reliability, and flexibility with high quality and low-cost output. The paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for Industry 4.0 set-up to achieve circular economy and cleaner production by optimizing products-machine allocation. The proposed MILP model optimizes the trade-off between energy consumption and machine processing cost to gain a circular economy and cleaner production respectively. The proposed model also achieves ethical business by deploying sensors to capture real-time information to establish the Industry 4.0 facility. The paper discusses the product-machine specific analysis to optimize the manufacturing of customized and high-end products at low production cost with minimal energy consumption. The objective of the paper is to minimize the total cost and energy consumption of machines for establishing the Industry 4.0 facility to gain a circular economy and cleaner production. The proposed model is demonstrated and computationally tested on small, moderate, and large data instances and presented with their detailed analysis.}

These technologies will improve processing efficiency, the creation of business opportunities, requirement regulation, information security, and transparency. While sharing electronic health records can assist in improving diagnosis accuracy, privacy and security preservation are imperative. In the network of IoT devices, that exchange involves sensitive medical data; patient monitoring has to be totally secured against privacy risks and attacks. Delays in treatment progress and emergency treatments could also result in medical data security and confidentiality violations.

In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.}

In the literature, several technologies associated with Industry 4.0 have been applied to improve the availability of equipment, including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), blockchain, and data mining. Nevertheless, there is still no survey study that seeks to show how reliability has collaborated to support decision-making in organizations, in the context of Industry 4.0. In general, most applications still focus on the productivity and health of individual equipment. However, in today's volatile and complex businesses, local decisions are no longer sufficient; it is necessary to analyze the organization entirely. Thus, being aware of the impacts that a local failure can impose on the entire company has significant weight in the decision-making process. In this context, this article presents a survey to identify how researches on systems reliability has contributed to and supported the development of decision-making in Industry 4.0. The main contribution of this article is to highlight how reliability can be used to support different types of strategic decisions in the context of Industry 4.0.

Digital twin (DT) brings about a possible means, due to its ability to provide candidate behavior adjustments based on received “feedbacks” from its physical part. However, such candidate adjustments are deterministic, and thus lack of flexibility and adaptability. To address such problem, in this paper an extended concept – evolutionary digital twin (EDT) and an EDT-based new mode for intelligent industrial product development has been proposed. With our proposed EDT, a more precise approximated model of the physical world could be established through supervised learning, based on which the collaborative exploration for optimal policies via parallel simulation in multiple cyberspaces could be performed through reinforcement learning. Hence, more flexibility and adaptability could be brought to industrial products through machine learning (such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning) based self-evolution. As a primary verification of the effectiveness of our proposed approach, a case study has been carried out. The experimental results have well confirmed the effectiveness of our EDT based development mode.}

More in detail, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Circular Economy (CE) are two key concepts that are characterizing the present and that will shape the future. From the extant literature review emerges that, although academics identify a possible synergy between these topics, a concrete integrated framework able to achieve CE at systemic level is still missing. The objective of this research is to put in relation the I4.0 and CE paradigms to understand the link between the two topics and envisage a new framework focused on circularity among supply chains. Therefore, a systematic literature review on CE, I4.0 and on their mutual relationship have been conducted to investigate which are the synergies and how the new I4.0 technologies support the implementation of CE at supply chains network level. Hence, a framework in which I4.0 technologies support the adoption of Reduce, Redesign, Recycling and Remanufacturing strategies has been developed. Indeed, starting from the 6Rs’ model (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover, Redesign, Remanufacture), the focus has been shifted towards these 4Rs since they have been considered the most affected by I4.0. Regarding the use of I4.0 technologies, Cloud Manufacturing (MaaS) and Additive Manufacturing have been deemed the most enabling technologies. Indeed, they allow to respectively aggregate resources and reduce wastes. The framework is supported by a quantitative analysis of economic and environmental impacts that results in the definition of a Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (MOILP). The framework works in closing the loop by acting as strategic node able to link different supply chains. It has been developed focusing on discrete manufacturing and replicable in different sectors. Finally, the model identified has been supported by some pilot assessments through semi-structured interviews.}

The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study’s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security. Given the pace of development in information technology, AI and data analysis, regulatory approvals for new services and products in the new Era of digital energy markets can be enforced as quickly and efficiently as possible.}

abstract = {Real Estate Online Platforms (REOPs) are used for conveying real estate and property-related information to potential users (buyers, renters, or sellers). The information leveraged through REOPs supports these users in reaching conclusive rent or buy decisions. Despite their promised utility, user perception about accepting online information through REOPs is unexplored. Using a comprehensive questionnaire and data collected from 65 users, the current study captures the users’ perception of REOPs. Risk, service, information, system, technology adoption model (RSISTAM) is proposed comprising of seven users’ perceptions: risk (PR), service quality (PSEQ), information quality (PIQ), and system quality (PSYQ) from the information systems success model, and usefulness (PU), ease of use (PEU) and behaviour to accept (BAU) from TAM. The results are analysed using the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach, which shows that PIQ, PSEQ and PEU are the causes and PR, PSYQ, PU and BAU are the effects. Among the criteria, the order of prominence is PEU > PSEQ > PIQ, and for net effects, the order is PU > BAU > PSYQ > PR. For addressing the causes, the REOP managers must provide more transparent, high quality and voluminous information to the users, focus on the system, services, and information qualities, and add more enjoyable, immersive and easy-to-use content through REOPs. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring user perceptions and proposing methods to improve the quality and reliability of REOPs in line with Real Estate 4.0 and industry 4.0 aims.}

It is widely accepted that blockchain technology causes disruptive changes in supply chain operations that can overcome supply chain difficulties encountered in realizing information sharing, maintaining traceability in the entire process and improving operational efficiency. However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential. This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations. A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes. This article provides valuable information to help scholars and practitioners better determine the relevant research topics to accelerate the development of blockchain-based supply chains.}

Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure.}

abstract = {Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the largest electronics market for hardware production due to its fast evolving application space. However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing.}
