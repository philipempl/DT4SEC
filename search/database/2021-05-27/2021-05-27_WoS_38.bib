Abstract = {{Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G)
   mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence
   in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin
   and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust
   instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy,
   federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for
   deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks.
   However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack
   of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated
   learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin
   wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless
   networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the
   edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning
   framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which
   improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data
   privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the
   proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge
   association by jointly considering digital twin association, training
   data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent
   reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem.
   Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme
   yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark
   learning methods.}},

Title = {{Metrics development and modelling the mixed reality and digital twin
   adoption in the context of Industry 4.0}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper aims to examine the current technology acceptance
   model (TAM) in the field of mixed reality and digital twin (MRDT) and
   identify key factors affecting users' intentions to use MRDT. The
   factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive
   model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users.
   This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
   Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was
   adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis
   of secondary data contained within published journal articles that
   focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items
   for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to
   meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were
   included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path
   coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b)
   test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the
   database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to
   2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly
   used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social
   influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived
   enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and
   behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the
   general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other
   important factors such as ``perceived immersion{''} could be added to
   the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to
   utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction
   project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic
   construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect
   employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The
   extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers
   or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of
   MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent
   due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and
   empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies
   which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality
   (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies
   may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer
   time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development
   in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a
   theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the
   individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research
   related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing
   managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to
   expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A
   set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will
   help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider
   acceptance.}},

Abstract = {{The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object,
   which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The
   DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle
   that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a
   production system and its components. A methodology design using
   model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being
   both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels:
   first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide
   basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication,
   security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and
   simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical
   composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on
   these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed
   using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that
   supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A
   case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated
   with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are
   described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify
   that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment
   process of a DT.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date
   virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in
   most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize
   the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use
   of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the
   dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a
   Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360 degrees camera
   and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The
   Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by
   constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360
   degrees live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature
   and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other
   purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using
   a 360 degrees web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object
   detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured
   stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an
   identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the
   corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these
   objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost
   importance to many other services and domains such as national security.
   To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and
   conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection
   and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness
   of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step
   forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart
   mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.}},

   Perimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous
   vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles.
   Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in
   the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system
   life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts.
   The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to
   efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use
   digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative
   evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system
   performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE
   experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current
   testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a
   smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios,
   connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation
   engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been
   successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security
   system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for
   autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated
   and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system
   behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and

Abstract = {{Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment (DSMA) has progressed from
   challenging traditional soil science paradigms, through small scale
   prototyping, to large-scale implementation capturing quantitative
   measures of soil attributes and functions. This paper considers the
   future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where
   high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding
   to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is
   for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided
   from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as
   a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a
   strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory,
   tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore
   expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of
   base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and
   forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer
   spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly
   globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of
   DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis
   of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to
   provide the background to a soil and landscape `digital twin' and the
   consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of
   land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA
   skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice
   involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools.
   Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of
   public-private partnerships in this development and application. (C)

Abstract = {{Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and

   a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on
   models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT
   networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In
   this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose
   the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical
   edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a
   blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen
   communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN.
   Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we
   propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin
   empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate
   spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm
   that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication

Abstract = {{Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for
   manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However,
   most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of

   flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to
   support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article
   combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel

   configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then,
   hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are
   designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of

   presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT
   with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the
   autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an
   MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the

Journal = {{ENERGIES}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{With the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs), with their
   associated communication and control complexities, there is a need for
   an efficient platform that can digest all the incoming data and ensure
   the reliable operation of the power system. The digital twin (DT) is a
   new concept that can unleash tremendous opportunities and can be used at
   the different control and security levels of power systems. This paper
   provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy
   cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple
   applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth
   and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision
   making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using
   Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical
   and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from
   the different actual power and control entities. The experimental
   results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of
   the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud
   computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the
   low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7\%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the
   proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the
   voltage estimates, with 98.2\% accuracy from only the controllers'
   states.}},

Abstract = {{Featured Application This work was elaborated in the frame of a
   collaborative innovation project named CyberFactory\#1 which aims at
   enhancing optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. Its
   outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial
   use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors
   such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication,
   consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is
   provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace
   System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is
   being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named
   Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing
   assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual
   assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their
   applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches
   are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and
   interdependencies between different production assets are commonly
   ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose
   innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash
   novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a
   holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented
   by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and
   simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including
   external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel
   approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for
   security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital
   Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of
   Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a
   specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Abstract = {{Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure
   efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the
   airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming
   increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including
   the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries,
   weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air
   cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan
   optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality
   system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for
   connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical

   (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment
   with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor
   data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal
   cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the
   digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal,

Abstract = {{The Blockchain is a novel technology with a wide range of potential
   industrial applications. Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and
   proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of
   Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the
   interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with
   Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in
   both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with
   distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity
   that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular:
   interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be
   guaranteed by design.
   This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic
   and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless
   applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an
   industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern
   and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors.
   Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering
   paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been
   designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios.
   Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between
   industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of
   immutable and trust-less ``digital twins{''} for industrial IOT

Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{780-788}},

Abstract = {{The previous applications of new digital methods (BIM) in infrastructure
   construction have led to the realization that merely a building
   information model is not sufficient for the ambitious goals of an
   optimized planning process and, as a result, optimized construction
   management. Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and
   that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in
   underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the
   structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to
   map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the
   ideal case of a ``digital twin{''}. The modeling of the ground goes
   beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do
   justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and
   characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major
   international projects clearly show that the optimization of
   construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment
   and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the
   production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and
   schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the

Abstract = {{Digitization era is altering several industries which include the way in
   which the data is analyzed and it is inferred that about 2.7 Zettabytes
   of data exist in the digital world today. By 2020 the data generated per
   second for every human being will approximate amount to 1.7 megabytes
   and the volume of data would double every 2 years thus reach the 40 ZB
   point by 2020. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by the
   end of year 2020, the e-commerce transactions B2B and B2C will hit 450
   billion per day on the internet.
   The advent of Big and real time Data has triggered disruptive changes in
   many fields and the exploding volume of different sources of data like
   heterogeneous data, data integration, spatio-temporal correlation of
   data, batch analytics and real-time analytics, data sharing, semantic
   interoperability requires the development of a scalable platform that
   can fuse multiple data layers to handles the data intelligently.
   In Big Data approaches, the challenge is not anymore to collect the
   data, but to draw valuable conclusions by properly analyzing them. The
   growth in Unstructured Data generated by business is irrefutable and
   they are under more pressure to preserve it for longer periods of time.
   To be clear, exploiting the collected data has been always considered by
   practitioners and researchers, but the huge velocity, heterogeneity and
   enormity of massive stream of real-time data shove the limits of the
   current storage, management and processing capabilities.
   Admittedly, the traditional method of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)
   are challenged and cannot be applied on the emerging opportunistically
   and crowed sensed data streams. Some of these data streams are
   structured in a way that serve only one predefined purpose and cannot be
   directly used for other means. Yet, there are emerging unstructured data
   such as context-based data from the internet and social media as well as
   credit card transactions that is not clear if they can be used to better
   understand the mobility patterns.
   The analytical company Gartner states that by 2020 there will be over 26
   billion interconnected devices. It is obvious, that they will produce
   massive amounts of meaningful data. Those data can be used for many
   applications such as real-time industrial equipment monitoring, traffic
   planning, automated maintenance, etc. Therefore, it is essential to
   develop modern system abstractions that allow us to resourcefully
   process huge and new data streams. This enormous amount of data urges
   the growth of integrated and insightful big and real-time data analytics
   Platforms.
   The upcoming contemporary technology like digital twin, integrates
   historical data from past machine usage to the current data. It uses
   sensors to collect the real-time data, working status and other
   operational data attached to the physical model. These components send
   the relevant data via a cloud-based system to the other side of the
   bridge with the help of data analytics platform which produces the
   required insights. The big and real-time data analytics Platforms assist
   to perform useful operations on data analytics as a complete package.
   For this purpose, data analytics platform are used to acquire
   constructive insight from the huge volume of data.
   Data analytics platform is an ecosystem of technologies and services
   that can help the businesses in increasing revenues, enhance operational
   efficiency, stabilize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts,
   respondmore quickly toemerging market trends and gain a competitive edge
   over rivals. The data analytics platform finds the pattern and
   relationships in data by applying statistical techniques and
   communicates the results generated by analytical models to executives
   and end users to make decisions with the help of data visualization
   tools that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real
   time as new information becomes available. Big data and real-time data
   analytics platform supports the full spectrum of data types, protocols
   and integration to speed up and simplify the data wrangling process. The
   big data and real time platform provides accurate data, increase
   efficiency in the workspace, gives answers to complex questions along
   with security and hence it plays the key role in business analytics.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Twin is a way to virtually represent or model a physical object
   using the real time data. This innovation sets up a way to deal with
   industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently
   bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name
   suggests, ``Digital Twin{''} infers that a reproduction of the product
   is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The
   procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data,
   processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive
   investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally
   enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their
   product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering
   information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could
   store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the
   intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the
   successful working of the products geographically distributed. The
   impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital
   twin.
   The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of
   utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as
   they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use.
   Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of
   manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The
   effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for
   activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach
   can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the
   virtual machine without the need of a specific training.
   With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial
   Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent
   approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own
   execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing
   self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded
   with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the
   field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital
   twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the
   data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting,
   organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data
   is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud.
   It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud
   which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and
   process it effectively.}},

   Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience

   chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including
   those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical
   supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials
   increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors
   like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair
   practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of
   lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of
   food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through
   challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and
   contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and
   survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent
   hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the
   system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world
   implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and
   detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in
   using it to serve their communities.}},

Title = {{Digital Twin for the Oil and Gas Industry: Overview, Research Trends,
   Opportunities, and Challenges}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O\&G) industry is
   now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity,
   efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and
   operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the
   O\&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows
   O\&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets.
   Considering DT adoption, the O\&G industry is still at an early stage
   with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications
   instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT
   implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related
   technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology,
   the current status of O\&G-related DT research activities, and the
   opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the
   O\&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this
   understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the
   context of the O\&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to
   select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based
   publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as
   Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered
   articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant
   Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and
   conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study.
   These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were
   thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology
   and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of
   DT deployment in the O\&G industry. From this literature review, it was
   found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle
   management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O\&G
   industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty
   in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O\&G
   industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT
   related research in the O\&G industry, the United States (US) is the
   leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China,
   Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall
   publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year
   until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The
   number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of
   conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented
   theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both
   these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O\&G
   industry is still at an early stage.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development and implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT)

Abstract = {{The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G
   deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish
   a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research.
   In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication
   needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of
   connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true
   representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial
   and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical,
   biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will
   shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new
   man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices
   acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among
   multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to
   create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv)
   precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With
   rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to
   become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data,
   compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving
   superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other
   major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i)
   cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the
   integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system
   definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on
   latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms
   involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security

   and Risks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient
   and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the
   freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and
   pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM
   have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid
   growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general
   characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain
   models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of
   the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply
   chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the
   virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively
   manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain
   (<italic>digital thread</italic>) with the physical supply chain and
   their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical
   system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of
   a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible
   attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse
   engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk
   classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity
   methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that
   threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing
   solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In
   providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies
   of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate
   the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further,
   we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and
   identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.}},

Abstract = {{Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security,
   there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of
   anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most
   outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in
   recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is
   the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the
   simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a
   paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically
   assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model
   guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin
   theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor
   control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for
   supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based
   data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the
   sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data
   association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of
   the reward function by using the results of the proposed

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{20325-20336}},
Abstract = {{The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of
   future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry
   4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface
   description related to a product or process available through a single
   interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment.
   However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future
   application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for
   specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We
   developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of
   communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks
   supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high
   levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject
   for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised
   of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over
   a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the
   system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a
   network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and
   attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization
   within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is
   limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from
   the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could
   be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for
   communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies
   that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we
   concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development
   in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own
   tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a
   potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and

   of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing
   systems, cyber-physical systems, or augmented reality. One of the latest
   technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain,
   which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability,
   accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness,
   and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a
   higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review
   analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the
   automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the
   applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the
   state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges.
   Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since
   the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and
   medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new
   business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it.
