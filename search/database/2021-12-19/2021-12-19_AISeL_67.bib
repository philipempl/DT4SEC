	abstract = {Since the last few years, the topic of Digital Twins receives considerable attention in research and with practitioners. A Digital Twin describes the connection between physical and virtual objects. However, a unified definition for Digital Twins is still missing. While existing literature reviews mainly focus on the application of Digital Twins, this review is analyzing the explanations, definitions, and elements of the Digital Twins described in the literature. Based on an examination of 233 papers, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy of a Digital Twin and sorts the most common definitions. The taxonomy developed in this contribution allows classifying the various definitions and concepts of Digital Twins that emerged in literature over the years. That may help the reader to gain profound insights into the domain of Digital Twins.},

With embedded connectivity units this changes so that manufacturers can gather data from vehicle in-build sensors and thus, gain insights into each products usage. Our study investigates why manufacturers aim to integrate connectivity units into their products to gather sensor based usage information and what hinders them to do so. Thereby, we aim to identify the factors that have an influence on the decision of vehicle manufacturers to adopt the concept of the vehicle digital twin. To unveil those factors, we conducted 30 expert interviews at two vehicle manufacturers in which we found benefits and barriers regarding the realization of a product digital twin. By conceptualizing the benefits and barriers, which have a positive or negative influence on the adoption decision from the perspective of the manufacturers, we were able to derive general influences on the adoption decision. In our adapted technology-organization-environment framework we found influences in the technological (i.e. product data and product heterogeneity), the organizational (i.e. business model orientation, readiness of internal processes and digital culture) and the environmental (i.e. competitors behaviour, legal regulations and customer demand) dimension.},

Therefore, this research in progress paper attempts to structure the research field and classify DTs for digital health and in future, for telemedicine. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR) and grounded theory analysis techniques, we derive 12 dimensions and 35 characteristics that support researchers and practitioners to develop, apply, refine and evaluate various DT applications. The taxonomy serves as a promising starting point for further research on implementing or adopting DTs in healthcare and telemedicine.

In addition, information sharing becomes increasingly decisive for the competition, e.g. in supply networks where products and logistics data such as demands and capacities are exchanged. As many companies are, however, highly reluctant to share data across the supply chain, this paper applies the methodology of design science research to, first, state the requirements for shared digital twins based on five industrial use cases. It turns out that with regard to data decentralism, sovereignty and compatibility through global standardization are key success factors. Hence, second, this paper presents a concept for a shared digital twin providing data on demand, i.e. at the right time and in particular with data condensed to the concrete need, thus, minimizing volume. The concept covers both the company-internal and the supply network perspective.},

To better understand and help mitigating older adults’ distress in their daily trips, this paper proposes constructing the digital twin city (DTC) model that integrates multimodal data (i.e., physiological sensing, visual sensing) on environmental demands in urban communities, so that such environmental demands can be considered in mobility planning of older adults. Specifically, this paper examines how data acquired from various modalities (i.e., electrodermal activity, gait patterns, visual sensing) can portray environmental demands associated with older adults’ mobility. In addition, it discusses the challenges and opportunities of multimodal data fusion in capturing environmental distresses in urban communities.},

Understanding the situation and disruptive events of critical infrastructure is essential to effective disaster response and recovery of communities. The potential of social media data for situation awareness during disasters has been highlighted in recent studies. However, the application of social sensing in detecting disruptions of critical infrastructure is limited because existing approaches cannot provide complete and non-ambiguous situational information about critical infrastructure. Therefore, to address this methodological gap, we developed a graph-based approach including data filtering, burst time-frame detection, content similarity and graph analysis. A case study of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Houston was conducted to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. The findings highlighted the temporal patterns of critical infrastructure events that occurred in disasters including disruptive events and their adverse impacts on communities. The findings also provided insights for better understanding critical infrastructure interdependencies in disasters. From the practical perspective, the proposed methodology study can improve the ability of community members, first responders and decision makers to detect and respond to infrastructure disruptions in disasters.},

Five SME’s from different domains out of the 20 surveyed are taken as case studies to evaluate the potential benefits, trade-offs and barriers from an implementation of these integrated technologies. The findings revealed that the companies are still coping with the issues relating to planning, logistics and automation. It was also found that all the concepts of i4.0 may not be necessary or even beneficial to an enterprise in the current scenario and new strategies need to be developed for its realization in SME’s.},

In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play important roles in connecting business to customers, processes and technologies creating a mesh of integrated and interconnected advanced systems that are not only able to sense the environment, but also learn, predict, adapt and potentially operate autonomously (Panetta, 2016). In this study, we propose a model that integrates the emergent Mesh technology with Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to meet challenges of today’s business analytics and technology adoption strategies. The adoption of digital mesh technology will be investigated among users who use mesh technology such as conversational systems, mesh app and mesh service for their business purposes.},

Not surprisingly, our results show that DIUs primarily focus on digital products and business models related to AI, IoT/Smart x and Data Analytics. Differentiating between four DIU setups, we could not find particular digital trends being addressed by specific setups. In addition, drawing on the Gartner Hype Cycle (GHC), we show that DIUs mostly pay attention to digital trends in more mature stages. We conclude and recommend the need for DIUs to focus on radical DIs to be as innovative as they should be and to pay attention on digital trends in the earlier stages of the GHC to promote radical DIs.},

We propose a literature based preliminary framework for platform data governance with five domains: original data quality; ownership and access; stewardship; platform data quality and value of data usage. We report experiences from a European shipbuilding network, which is seeking ways to share data collected during ship’s operations. While the device manufacturers already process sensor data within their device-specific platforms, they are knowledgeable about potential benefits of sharing their data with others in the network. Based on interviews within the shipyard network, we report views along the five platform data governance domains.},

Our analysis compares the performance of a bare metal machine, a virtual machine without artifact mitigation, and a virtual machine with our proof-of-concept mitigation technique applied to a temperature sensor. Results of the implementation are analyzed to determine the potential impact on system performance and whether our mitigation technique is appropriate for extending high-fidelity hypervisors.},

In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the integration of data and analytics as an analytical unit into the field of Service Innovation – referred to as Data-Driven Service Innovation (DDSI). Overall, the SLR reveals three main research perspectives that span the research field of Data-Driven Service Innovation: Explorative DDSI, validative DDSI, and generative DDSI. This integrated theoretical framework describes the distinct operant roles of data analytics for Service Innovation, and thus contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of DDSI by providing three unified lenses, which researchers can use to describe and locate their existing and future research endeavors in this ample field. Building up on the insights from the SLR, a research agenda is proposed in order to trigger and guide further discussions and future research surrounding DDSI. Ultimately, this paper aims at contributing to the body of knowledge of Service Innovation in general and Data-Driven Service Innovation in particular by presenting a three-dimensional research space model structuring DDSI towards its advancement.},

Where tokenization may disrupt our economic system leading to more efficiency or democracy, it is required to gain insights and facilitate the development of use cases associated with this concept.

This paper aims to focus on identifying challenges that pose knowledge risks and pos-sible actions to overcome them. Particularly, the focus is on knowledge risks emerging out of an organizational and technical perspective. These risks can also act as a barrier for technology adaption in industry, hence it is important to provide an overview of existing research, synthesize it with one another, and translate it to unexplored gaps. Therefore, a structured literature review is conducted. It is found that challenges are often related to topics of data security, data analytics, training, and trustful relation-ships.

The business model of those platforms introduces transaction costs for users. Additionally, these platforms often create lasting dependencies, lack transparency, and therefore trust. At the same time, new technologies such as blockchain emerged, which promise to solve these various issues by enabling decentralized transactions. This paper uses a design science research approach to develop an infrastructure for decentralized collaborative manufacturing. Therefore, we matched requirements for existing platform approaches to decentralizing technologies. To evaluate the approach, we conducted expert interviews to verify the usefulness and assess potential improvements to extend existing research dimensions of collaboration systems.},

We contribute to the literature on process automation by unveiling transparent and immutable, cross-organizational, and decentralized automation as characteristics that differentiate smart contracts from established automation technologies. Besides, we provide practitioners with an understanding of application scenarios, potentials, and drawbacks of smart contracts for process automation.},

	abstract = {Numerous statements and pamphlets indicate that governments should increase the transparency of ICT-implementations and algorithms in eGovernment services and should encourage democratic control. This paper presents research among civil servants, suppliers and experts who play a role in the automation of spatial policymaking and planning (e.g. environment, building, sound and CO2 regulation, mobility). The case is a major digitalisation programme of that spatial planning in the Netherlands. In this digital transition, the research assumption is that public and political values such as transparency, legitimacy and (perceived) fairness are difficult to validate in the practice of the design process; policy makers tend to lose sight of the algorithms and decision trees designed during the ICT -implementation of eGovernment services. This situation would implicate a power shift towards the system level bureaucrat. i.e., the digitized execution of laws and regulations, thereby threatening democratic control. This also sets the stage for anxiety towards ICT projects and digital bureaucracies. We have investigated perceptions about ‘validation dark spots’ in the design process of the national planning platform that create unintended shifts in decision power in the context of the legal planning process. To identify these validation dark spots, 22 stakeholders were interviewed. The results partially confirm the assumption. Based on the collected data, nine validation dark spots are identified that require more attention and research.},

Based on a conceptualization of such situations, a lifecycle "plug-in" is proposed in the form of a methodology and associated tool support, allowing for responsive evolution of the adopted modeling method with impact on several lifecycle phases. Historical examples from the evolution of a BPM product are provided to illustrate and classify the demands that motivate the existence of this "lifecycle plug-in".},

We have addressed the challenge by applying a sequence of innovation intermediaries involving actors from the local port and students from three bachelor programs. The outcome manifested itself in the acquisition of both tacit and encoded knowledge and served as a milestone in establishing a standard within maritime IT.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2018_rp/92},
	abstract = {Digitalization disrupts business models and smartifies products and services. Based on the ever-faster emergence and adoption of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, or augmented reality, digitalization irreversibly changes our private lives and organizational routines from all industries on a global scale. Thereby, digitalization develops unlimited potential in terms of innovation, connectivity, efficiency and productivity improvements. However, research and practice still lack a fundamental understanding of the nature of digital technologies. To address this gap, we developed a multi-layer taxonomy of digital technologies that includes eight dimensions structured along the layers of established modular architectures, i.e. service, content, network, and device. Based on our taxonomy, we also identified seven archetypes of digital technologies by means of a cluster analysis. To revise and evaluate our artefacts, we classified 45 digital technologies from the Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies and conducted evaluation rounds with other researchers. Our results contribute to the descriptive knowledge on digital technologies. They enable researchers and practitioners to classify digital technologies on two levels of aggregation and to make informed decisions about their adoption.},

	volume = {9},
	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/ijispm/vol9/iss4/4},
	abstract = {The emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has revolutionized the infrastructure construction industry by introducing real-time and collaborative information management tools to be used throughout the lifecycle of projects. The importance of BIM in this industry has been emphasized in previous research. However, strategies for the implementation of this system is still less explored, which requires more elaboration and validation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate such strategies considering all necessary dimensions of the BIM system in infrastructure construction projects. The findings are based on theoretical discussion and semi-structured interviews in a case study project in New South Wales, Australia. The results revealed that BIM integrates various elements of infrastructure construction, which include but are not limited to risk, time, cost, energy, safety, and sustainability. It was found that implementation strategies should focus on improving the contribution of the BIM system to infrastructure construction in terms of improved (1) integrity and automation, (2) collaboration, and (3) optimization. Identification of seven technical and managerial implementations strategies is the core contribution of this research. These strategies provide practitioners with insight into technical and managerial measures to be taken for the successful implementation of the BIM system.},

	abstract = {Driven by digitalization and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ‘war for talents’ is increasingly shifting towards the digital world, transforming traditional personnel selection systems into information systems. While these digital personnel selection systems (DPSSs) make use of video interviews or gamified assessments to realize benefits in terms of cost-efficiency and sustainability, the use of digital technologies has a significant impact on user behaviors and selection outcomes. Against this backdrop, we present a common, interdisciplinary conceptualization of DPSSs in terms of a framework for technology-driven factors, which we inferred from a systematic literature review. Our interview-based evaluation showed that such an overview is urgently needed in research and practice. Our findings represent a theory for analyzing and add to the descriptive knowledge by providing an information systems lens on personnel selection. With this understanding of technology-driven factors, we provide a profound basis for developing user-centric DPSSs.},

Existing literature reviews indicate that the number of available models has increased sharply in recent years. At the same time, it is found that the number of model applications does not keep up with the pace of development. Against the background of the current digitization trend, this article empirically investigates which models are actually used in business practice. We find that the degree of application is very low. Moreover, we also examine user-related model requirements, reasons for employing MMs, and the purpose of using MMs, which can support the user-centered development of future MMs.},

Benefits for companies arise within four dimensions and concern various issues ranging from production related benefits to superordinate benefits affecting the business model. To conclude, managerial implications resulting from dependencies and the variety of benefits are presented.},

	abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) and digital platforms have offered industrial companies new opportunities to compete against digital platform-native companies. To succeed in this competition, industry incumbents must learn to extend their traditional product and service business through platforms. However, extant research has focused primarily on the ability of platform owners to govern mature platforms for innovation but has largely ignored how industry incumbents can build these capabilities internally during the establishment of their platform ecosystems as part of larger transformational journeys. To address this gap, we conduct a multiple case study of three incumbent organizations, drawing on a dynamic capability lens. We identify 11 practical microfoundations of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities that aided three incumbents in establishing their IoT platform ecosystems. Besides the transformational activities, our findings contribute to the literature on platform establishment through three IoT-related shifts that deviate from known digital platform paradigms.},

The blockchain technology is supposed to solve many problems as it promises to save time, avoid costs, reduce risk, and increase trust among the participants. It leads to many approaches that enable tracking and tracing of goods in supply chains. We found out that the proposed solutions are unnecessarily complicated and that there was no defined process to introduce a blockchain-based tracing solution in companies using lean principles. Therefore, we utilized a value stream mapping approach to develop a simple tracing mechanism based on colored coins and show how they can be implemented in companies. The resulting tracing mechanism and implementation process were evaluated with the partners of a joint research project and showed excellent future development potential.},

	abstract = {In research, industrial case studies are a possibility to collect information about complex phenomena from the environment where they occur. Digital transformation (DT) is a complex phenomenon, but there is a paucity of published case studies which describe the intermediary steps taken in enterprise DT activities. The paper contributes to a more diversified picture of digital transformation (DT) by describing and analyzing the step-by-step transformation of five case studies. The approach proposed for planning and analysis of DT cases in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) consists of three elements: (a) focus on the dimensions “products/services” and “operations” when initiating DT in SME, (b) use step-by-step transformation along transformation paths instead of aiming at transformation in one go, and (c) include the success factors of DT known from literature in the step-by-step approach.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/pajais/vol12/iss3/3},
	abstract = {Background: The digital transformation is an increasingly popular research topic. Unfortunately, it lacks a common and sustainable theoretical fundament. Further, it is unclear which role the characteristics of the affected industries, firms and markets play regarding the impact that the digital transformation has on them., Method: Taking up these two challenges in a combined fashion for one of the economically most important, but also most specialized and physical global industries, we systematically review the latest literature on the digital transformation within the manufacturing context., Results: This work is the first one that provides a valid theoretical basis on the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry. Thereby, it becomes clear that this basis is severely depending on its context. In particular, we show that the manufacturing industry is special in several dimensions, mainly due to its high physicality. Many of the connected technological concepts and domains are solely applicable within that particular environment. Also, our results indicate that a notable share of manufacturing firms did not experience any or at least not big impacts by the digital transformation on the business model level but indeed heavy impacts on the process level until now. However, for our initial suspicion that the structural differences between the manufac-turing industry and other more hardware-independent industries are so far reaching as that they would even lead to definitional differences, no evidence was found., Conclusions: This study contributes to the ongoing line of activities trying to streamline the extensive research around the digital transformation and thereby especially emphasizes the importance of context in that area of research., Available at: https://aisel.aisnet.org/pajais/vol12/iss3/3/},

To uncover the potential of AQC as a tool to foster user engagement, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment comprising 17,241 visits to a news website. Our findings reveal that users spend more time on the website and explore more pages when users can (vs. cannot) customize the quantity of ads. Most interestingly, users engage more with the website when given the possibility of AQC than when experiencing a website that is ad-free by default. Additionally, users respond particularly positively to AQC when using mobile (vs. stationary) devices. With our research, we contribute to literature on web customization and provide insightful guidance whether and how website providers can harness ad customization.},
