abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, many complex multi-vendor production environments, such as telecom infrastructures in smart cities or on-board passenger information systems in trains, are based on micro-services and deployed in the cloud. From a service integrator viewpoint, building new solutions for these environments, which can host a large number of externally designed and developed micro-services, is often complex and error-prone. This is in part due to undocumented behaviour or undocumented architectural specifications of such systems. Advanced service monitoring can offer a solution to quickly detect anomalies or unexpected service interaction behaviour during on-site integration. However, the monitoring service should not have an impact on the production environment itself. Therefore, this article proposes an agent-based unobtrusive monitoring platform, capable of monitoring both internally developed and externally developed services through the use of sidecar containers. It monitors state, metrics and network traffic at micro-service level and the research was conducted as part of the DynAMo research project, a collaboration with various industry partners. Prototype evaluation proves that our solution has a negligible impact (below 0.02\% CPU usage on average) on an existing micro-service environment just as other monitoring systems like Prometheus while offering additional functionality focused on multi-vendor service integration. This makes it suitable to be deployed in complex production domains to further aid on-site integration and quickly find potential new anomalies.}

abstract = {Abstract A systems perspective of an emergent field such as Industry 4.0 requires combining and analysing the entire multidisciplinary scholarship under one map. Recent developments in scientometric analysis allow researchers to carry out complex bibliometric analyses coupled with an unstructured ontological discovery made available through thematic and ensuing semantic analyses to gain a holistic outlook on the ecosystem of Industry 4.0. The state-of-the-art review of the entire scholarship of Industry 4.0 demonstrates three broad clusters—the implications of automation on industry, the integration of technologies and technological advancements driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The scholarship output is, for the first time, compared with the leading industrial and policymaking institutional reports to highlight similarities and discrepancies. This allows to propose a previously unavailable definition of Industry 4.0, which is much needed to progress the research further. The three highly discrepant areas between academic literature and industry insights include lack of research into return on investment, lack of research involving policymaking, and the implications of technological development on the workforce, firms and countries. It is imperative to drive research into the existent, as well as the highlighted, themes in advancing the knowledge and aligning the academic scholarship with the interests of practitioners.},

abstract = {Summary Intangible assets are the raw material for trade and social relationships in the 21st Century and, more precisely, for the value chains of the digital age. The creation, protection, exchange, valorization, enrichment and monetization of intangible assets all come up against obstacles in the form of three categories of systemic asymmetries: trust and security asymmetries, information and control asymmetries, and revenue and recognition asymmetries. The original Bitcoin protocol, called proof of work, aims to prevent malicious people from attacking the Bitcoin network by forcing them to use their computing power to prove their contributions to the network. Private protocols, such as proof of authority, are more “human centered” and can achieve a much lower carbon footprint. The augmentation convergence of the Bio, Phy and Digital worlds is based on the AugmentChain propelled by three “pyramidal” engines, the enablers, the catalysts and the outcome that work together in short cycles.}

The digital transformation is an opportunity to shed some light on the role of the human individual in digital manufacturing and the business development potential of a human-centered work design. Measures taken to adapt work to people refer to technical-ergonomic conditions and/or to substantive-organizational conditions of the work activity. Immersion, that is, complete immersion in the virtual world by means of head-mounted displays or projections, addresses as many human senses as possible, in order to achieve a realistic simulation. The digital transformation is changing human work and workload patterns.}

Disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, blockchain, 3D printing, 5G and Internet-of-Thing (IoT), digital twins, and augmented reality (AR), are widely applied. They potentially will bring a radical change to real world operations. In this paper, we first explore several major disruptive technologies, examine the corresponding OM studies and highlight their current applications in the industry. Then, we discuss the pros and cons associated with the use of these technologies and uncover the potential human-machine conflicting areas. After that, we propose measures which may be able to achieve human-machine reconciles in the coming Industry 5.0 era. A concept of “sustainable social welfare” which includes worker welfare, privacy, etc. is proposed and the roles played by policy makers are also discussed. Finally, a future research agenda, which covers topics in both the Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 eras, is established.}

Cloud security and M2M communication permit the discovery of the best conceivable security configuration, improve communication, self-monitoring, and diagnose cloud security issues without the need for human intervention. Restrictions and crucial points are emphasized to arrange for initial forensics investigations and also further studies in this area. This chapter presents a model that is generic in nature for network forensics in the cloud environment as well as defines prototype artifact that articulates the M2M communication security issue that impacts on fourth industrial revolution application. We validate the architecture prototype with an implementation based on the OpenNebula Hypervisor web-based interface and the NetworkMiner analysis framework.}

With the development of computing power, innovative algorithms, and gathering of massive data, AI will be rejuvenated in the next decade and become one of the most important enabling technologies for 5G automation. How to use the powerful analysis, judgment, and prediction capabilities provided by the AI algorithms to enable 5G equipment, networks and service systems, and combine them with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of carriers' networks become an important topic in the ICT industry. Based on deep understanding, accumulated experience in telecom field, and long-term investment in AI strategies, many organizations have been introducing AI technology to telecom networks and contributing to development of standards essential for improving the quality and security of AI products and services, ensuring user safety and creating a fair and open industry ecosystem. 5G networks can be automatically deployed (automatic service deployment and automatic running) with the introduction of AI based on application scenarios. AI algorithms can also be used for self-healing (automatic fault recovery), self-optimization (network self-optimization) and creating autonomous 5G systems (self-evolving networks), which continuously improve network efficiency and reduce OPEX. This article aims at presenting the most relevant use cases, prominent research outcomes, latest standard developments and related standardization gaps, examples of AI strategy interpretation, AI solutions – including communication intelligent platform, AI model service, and deployment solution – and typical application scenarios. As a part of this framework, this article introduces the most important aspects of AI security, in terms of protecting the integrity and confidentiality of AI models and data, and thus preventing attackers from changing the inference results or stealing data.}

This study provides the results of a brief investigation of the main factors that contribute the success of DT and demonstrates the value of using technology roadmapping alongside systems engineering (SE) practices to create a path between identified “AS-IS” and “TO-BE” operational states. Applying SE methods to the adoption of the “T-Plan” roadmapping process resulted in a strategic communication tool that can be used among stakeholders to support them with the integration of business planning and technology adoption, and to help assess the impact that new technologies may have on their organizations in their journey toward a successful DT. In addition to the roadmap itself, which benefits the case company, this study contributes to building and enriching academic literature by providing insight from the oil and gas industry and demonstrating the use of technology roadmapping to create a strategic plan for DT in a well-established industrial domain.}

abstract = {Summary Today, Machine Learning (ML) is apart of our daily life. It has major advancements in its applications and research as well. ML is the study in which a machine is trained with past data and examples and uses algorithms to build the logic. Important ML applicationsare speech recognition, computer vision, bio-surveillance, robot or automation control, empirical science experiments, DNA classification, intrusion detection, astronomical data analysis, information security, transportation, etc. According to a recent survey, computer-generated insurance advice is helpful to customers. Using ML, determination of cover for a certain customer can be predicted. Choice of the mode of transportation can also be benefited from ML. ML predicts the mode of transportation for an individual to make their travel better. Travel modes may include private car, public transport (bus or train), or soft mode (walking or cycling). The very first step in applying ML is to define a problem. This step includes three important processes to be considered, namely, problem identification, the motivation behind problem solving, and the solution itself. This chapter presents the evolution of ML along with the purpose it serves. It also focuses on the ideas of concept learning along with the methods and algorithms therein.}

abstract = {Abstract Business process management (BPM) provides many benefits for a company including productivity, efficiency, compliance, risk management, consistency, repeatability, and measurability. Many of these aspects also ensure and improve functional safety, privacy, and security in process execution. However, managed business processes lack flexibility; ie, changing a business process requires more effort than ad hoc execution and adaptation. Thus, especially in small companies, the acceptance rate of managed business processes is low. So we claim that in current BPM approaches, the structuredness ensuring functional safety and security concepts contradicts with the objective for flexibility. The main goal of the AdaBPM project is to address this contradiction by providing a formal approach to handle advanced adaptations and exception handling in business processes. The technical objectives of the project include (1) the definition of a basic framework being capable of handling different levels of adaptivity and considering security and safety requirements at the same time, (2) a rigorous process specification language and model refinement methods, (3) static business process adaptations, and (4) dynamic (or ad hoc) adaptations. The result of our research is a general approach for flexible BPM combined with the possibility to nevertheless manage the process and define safety and security restrictions.},

abstract = {Summary Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are hybrid systems comprising multiple components and many other combinations of various integrated but heterogeneous computational and physical capabilities. Todays embedded system such as iPhones and smart watches have integrated hardware and software solutions. There are engineering methodologies available to develop such embedded systems, focusing on the system. While their use at a personal level is much understood, what is less understood, and a topic of ongoing research is the question of what happens when such systems are deployed across multiple sectors, such as intelligent transportation systems, Internet of Things, smart medical devices, and many more, and used in activities not originally intended by the designers, for example, controlling the physical devices such as an automobile or an electricity power generation plant. This cross-sector deployment and the collective use of such systems introduces risk at the macro-system level that may have cascaded impacts in a highly networked environment, which further impact the constituent systems themselves. This is a major problem. One possibility to reduce the technical risk is to remotely control the systems in the cyber environments, but the sheer number of variables and possible situations introduce complexity at multiple scales. This complexity results in test plans with limited coverage. Additional cyber physical system related issues of intelligence, adaptation, autonomy, and security make the problem even worse. The proposed solution is the enhanced use of Modeling and Simulation (M\&S). The M\&S discipline has supported the development of complex systems since its inception. This chapter provides an overview on the M\&S methods and technologies that aid CPS engineering in the development and testing phases, and CPS governance when they are deployed in complex cyber environments.}

abstract = {The ‘Internet of things’ is the ‘new revolution’. During the past decades, there were major changes in the energy industry: the increased implementation of renewable generation, together with a greater use of electronic power elements in the network such as high-voltage DC links and the use of flexible AC transmission system and new market requirements, introduce new challenges and a need for more intelligent assets monitoring; and additional optimisation with a better balance in the combination of different energy sources and thus guaranteeing the reliability of supply and quality of energy; together with the identification of new business models that allow the integration of new technologies, neutralising cyber threats and ensure an adequate dissemination of knowledge to new generations. Companies are migrating to a more digital model based fundamentally on three pillars: communications, big data and artificial intelligence. The right combination of these three pillars will optimise the operation of the electrical system, reducing costs and polluting emissions, accelerating the adoption of non-polluting energies and renewable energies, while maximising economic performance and a closer way of interacting with users. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has been identified as one of the technologies with most potential impact in the next years.},

abstract = {Abstract A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical product, asset, process, system, or service that allows us to understand, predict, and optimise their performance for better business outcomes. Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.},

abstract = {Abstract An observed increase in systems scale and complexity has led to a significant momentum in exploring, identifying, and adopting model based systems engineering (MBSE) tools and techniques amongst research communities and industry practitioners. Several attempts to transform systems design and engineering practices through the use of MBSE in academia and industry has led to a considerable increase in the number of articles published containing the keyword “MBSE.” This growth serves as the motivation in this paper to explore the MBSE landscape with the help of text mining techniques to identify the most often used key terms, tools, and languages, in the context of research in MBSE and the thematic aspects defining the use of MBSE by researchers and practitioners. The objective of this paper is to provide a structured comprehensive overview of research contributions across the MBSE landscape by employing text mining techniques for: (a) identifying the concepts and methodologies inferred upon in relation to MBSE, and (b) classifying the literature published to identify commonalities across academic researchers and practitioners using MBSE tools and methods. For this purpose, the abstracts of 2380 relevant articles published in the period of the last two decades from five different databases are mined. It is found that the terms “SysML,” “Cyber Physical Systems,” and “Production” are the most used terms among researchers across the MBSE landscape with SysML being the most widely used modeling language. Further, six major thematic topics are identified that classify articles from over the last two decades with an increasing interest observed in the use of MBSE to support manufacturing and production engineering activities, especially in the cyber physical systems domain. The contributions of this paper provide a leeway on using text mining techniques to understand the research directions that are currently of interest in the field of MBSE and thereby identify potential future research directions.}

We need different thinking that resists the inclination of the affluent 20\% of the world to treat the rest of the world (80\% of the population) as a market.

Digital measurements will ensure the following: eliminating manual error or inconsistency, increasing productivity, minimizing waste, and enabling greater factory automation. Several measurands can be recorded with a data acquisition system including distance and displacement, temperature, voltage, current strain, and pressure. Measurement and quantification are the basic concepts of metrology. This considers explicit and internationally accepted definitions, principles and standards.

Even as unprecedented demand for state-of-the-art batteries drives gigascale production around the world, there are increasing calls for next-generation batteries that are safer, more affordable, and energy-dense. These trends motivate the intense pursuit of battery manufacturing processes that are cost effective, scalable, and sustainable. The digital transformation of battery manufacturing plants can help meet these needs. This review provides a detailed discussion of the current and near-term developments for the digitalization of the battery cell manufacturing chain and presents future perspectives in this field. Current modelling approaches are reviewed, and a discussion is presented on how these elements can be combined with data acquisition instruments and communication protocols in a framework for building a digital twin of the battery manufacturing chain. The challenges and emerging techniques provided here is expected to give scientists and engineers from both industry and academia a guide toward more intelligent and interconnected battery manufacturing processes in the future.}

In such systems, it is mandatory to monitor the field network and detect potential threats before a problem occurs. This work proposes a hybrid approach that orchestrates unsupervised and incremental learning methods to detect threats that impact the control loops in a plant. We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90\% precision and with accuracy higher than 95\%.},

Artificial intelligence, 3D printing, virtual reality, digital twin, blockchain, robotics, and digital technologies are transforming the means of production, organization, and business models of companies. If it is a more competitive technological revolution, bearer of numerous innovations, and creator of a new market dynamic, of possible reintegration of manufacturing in Western countries, Industry 4.0 disrupts the world of work as a whole. Indeed, it is the whole system of decision and political regulation of companies, communities, and states (and their natures) of the work relations on the part of the operators which is questioned with an obligation to get out of the processes of individualization and social misanthropy which are taking place at the moment. Transitions are therefore taking place with the search for a possible combination of classical aspects with the immense potential of digital technologies.}

This chapter examines the latest digital approach to the oil and gas industry that is the enabler to connected metering. Connected metering is digital transformation that is emerging for Industrial Internet of Things in which ubiquitous connectivity is coupled to cloud-borne data analytics and storage systems in enhancing metering accuracy and reliability. Metering has seen a tremendous growth since its early introduction in the 1800s in terms of both technology and market size. Connectivity is that enabled by the digital economy and its ubiquitous connectivity. Condition based monitoring is largely operating within the oil and gas industry as a stranded asset and typically for ultrasonic meters. A positive-unexpected consequence of collecting data within a digitization strategy is that further subsets of data may be readily formed from the larger master data sets bringing about new insights.}

abstract = {Summary The transition to an intermittent energy production from renewable energy sources (RES) increases the complexity of providing reliable energy supply in Germany. Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.},
