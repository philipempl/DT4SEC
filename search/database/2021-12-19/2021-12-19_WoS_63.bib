Abstract = {{The digital twin is a rather new industrial control and automation
   systems concept. While the approach so far has gained interest mainly
   due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations,
   recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention
   within the research community. In this article, we discuss how a digital
   twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be
   used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes.
   We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based
   data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state
   synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization
   requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other
   security components of the architecture. We also make performance
   evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using
   the proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides a
   foundation for future research work in this promising new area.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Twin is a way to virtually represent or model a physical object
   using the real time data. This innovation sets up a way to deal with
   industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently
   bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name
   suggests, ``Digital Twin{''} infers that a reproduction of the product
   is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The
   procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data,
   processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive
   investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally
   enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their
   product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering
   information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could
   store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the
   intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the
   successful working of the products geographically distributed. The
   impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital
   twin.
   The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of
   utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as
   they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use.
   Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of
   manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The
   effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for
   activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach
   can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the
   virtual machine without the need of a specific training.
   With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial
   Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent
   approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own
   execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing
   self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded
   with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the
   field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital
   twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the
   data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting,
   organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data
   is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud.
   It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud
   which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and
   process it effectively.}},

Title = {{Digital Twin-Based Safety Risk Coupling of Prefabricated Building
   Hoisting}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Safety management in hoisting is the key issue to determine the
   development of prefabricated building construction. However, the
   security management in the hoisting stage lacks a truly effective method
   of information physical fusion, and the safety risk analysis of hoisting
   does not consider the interaction of risk factors. In this paper, a
   hoisting safety risk management framework based on digital twin (DT) is
   presented. The digital twin hoisting safety risk coupling model is
   built. The proposed model integrates the Internet of Things (IoT),
   Building Information Modeling (BIM), and a security risk analysis method
   combining the Apriori algorithm and complex network. The real-time
   perception and virtual-real interaction of multi-source information in
   the hoisting process are realized, the association rules and coupling
   relationship among hoisting safety risk factors are mined, and the
   time-varying data information is visualized. Demonstration in the
   construction of a large-scale prefabricated building shows that with the
   proposed framework, it is possible to complete the information fusion
   between the hoisting site and the virtual model and realize the visual
   management. The correlative relationship among hoisting construction
   safety risk factors is analyzed, and the key control factors are found.
   Moreover, the efficiency of information integration and sharing is
   improved, the gap of coupling analysis of security risk factors is
   filled, and effective security management and decision-making are
   achieved with the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date
   virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in
   most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize
   the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use
   of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the
   dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a
   Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360 degrees camera
   and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The
   Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by
   constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360
   degrees live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature
   and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other
   purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using
   a 360 degrees web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object
   detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured
   stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an
   identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the
   corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these
   objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost
   importance to many other services and domains such as national security.
   To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and
   conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection
   and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness
   of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step
   forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart
   mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art digital
   twin and digital thread technology in industrial operations. Both are
   transformational technologies that have the advantage of improving the
   efficiency of current design and manufacturing. Digital twin is an
   important element of the Industry 4.0 digitalization process; however,
   the huge amount of data that are generated and collected by a digital
   twin offer challenges in handling, processing and storage. The paper
   aims to report on the development of a new framework that combines the
   digital twin and digital thread for better data management in order to
   drive innovation, improve the production process and performance and
   ensure continuity and traceability of information. The digital
   twin/thread framework incorporates behavior simulation and physical
   control components, in which these two components rely on the
   connectivity between the twin and thread for information flow and
   exchange to drive innovation. The twin/thread framework encompasses
   specifications that include organizational architecture layout,
   security, user access, databases and hardware and software requirements.

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of digital twin technology, a large amount of
   digital twin data named as big digital twin data (BDTD), is generated in
   the lifecycle of equipment, which is supposed to be used in digital twin
   enabled applications. However, in the implementation of these
   applications, data sharing problem which is caused by the lack of data
   security as well as trust among stakeholders of equipment, limits data
   using value. It is a novel way to introduce blockchain technology into
   digital twin to solve the problem. However, current methods cannot
   fulfill the requirements of exponential growth and timely sharing of
   BDTD. Therefore, a blockchain-based framework for secure sharing of BDTD
   is proposed to solve the problems. Cloud storage is integrated into the
   framework, with which, BDTD is encrypted and stored in Cloud, while the
   hash of BDTD and transaction records are stored in blockchain. Some
   rules of generating new block are designed to improve the processing
   speed of blockchain. An algorithm for optimal sampling rate selection is
   presented to maximize total social benefits of the participants of BDTD
   sharing. Simulation results show that the algorithm is better than
   traditional method for maximizing the total social benefits.
   Furthermore, a protype system is developed and evaluated based on Fabric
   test network. Evaluation results show that BDTD can be shared securely
   multiple times per second through the framework, which demonstrates the
   feasibility of the framework in supporting timely sharing of BDTD.}},

Abstract = {{As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is
   the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and
   provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support
   healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and
   policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience.
   Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience
   in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been
   applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in
   vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code
   context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related
   keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins.
   Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a
   full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience
   check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme
   for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare
   digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture
   bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A
   number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground
   truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and
   non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our
   new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for
   vulnerability detection.}},

Abstract = {{Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure
   efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the
   airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming
   increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including
   the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries,
   weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air
   cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan
   optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality
   system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for
   connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical
   operations and virtual space. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment
   (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment
   with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor
   data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal
   cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the
   digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal,
   especially the allocation of dangerous goods and special cargo. Load
   planners can master complex air cargo load planning through the system
   with optimal solutions generated. The operations of cargo assembly and
   security screening with digital twins could be further developed for
   future development.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{To ensure food security, agricultural production systems should innovate
   in the direction of increasing production while reducing utilized
   resources. Due to the higher level of automation with respect to
   traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture
   (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at
   the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin
   (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the
   productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource
   consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is
   introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its
   validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize
   productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the
   optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control
   of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management.
   Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the
   authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies
   for improving the productivity of CEA systems.</p>}},

Abstract = {{Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G)
   mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence
   in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin
   and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust
   instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy,
   federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for
   deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks.
   However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack
   of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated
   learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin
   wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless
   networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the
   edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning
   framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which
   improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data
   privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the
   proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge
   association by jointly considering digital twin association, training
   data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent
   reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem.
   Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme
   yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark
   learning methods.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the installation of various apparatus in process industries, both

   integrating virtual modeling, process monitoring, diagnosis, and

   parameters, the adaptive system identification is proposed to model
   closed-loop virtual systems and residual signals with fault-free case
   data. Performance indices are improved to make the design of robust

   Soft-sensor, parameterization control, and model-matching
   reconfiguration are ameliorated and incorporated into the optimized
   control configuration to guarantee stable and safe control performance
   under apparatus faults. The effectiveness and performance of the

Abstract = {{With the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs), with their
   associated communication and control complexities, there is a need for
   an efficient platform that can digest all the incoming data and ensure
   the reliable operation of the power system. The digital twin (DT) is a
   new concept that can unleash tremendous opportunities and can be used at
   the different control and security levels of power systems. This paper
   provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy
   cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple
   applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth
   and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision
   making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using
   Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical
   and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from
   the different actual power and control entities. The experimental
   results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of
   the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud
   computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the
   low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7\%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the
   proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the
   voltage estimates, with 98.2\% accuracy from only the controllers'
   states.}},

Title = {{ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{107574-107588}},
Abstract = {{The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern
   regarding the development of security monitoring and management
   mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in
   ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not
   easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the
   natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions
   implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical
   objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security
   analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed
   in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises
   deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return
   will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support
   infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data
   collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the
   acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to
   design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures,
   developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are
   built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic
   Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection
   processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning
   models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The
   validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of
   the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using
   cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the
   projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go
   OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS
   (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate
   that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins
   have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and
   Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of
   data are generated.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and
   next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid
   development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the
   increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and
   allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains
   a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on
   models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT
   networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In
   this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose
   the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical
   edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a
   blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen
   communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN.
   Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we
   propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin
   empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate
   spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm
   that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication
   efficiency and data security for IoT applications.}},

Journal = {{ENTROPY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security,
   there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of
   anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most
   outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in
   recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is
   the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the
   simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a
   paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically
   assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model
   guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin
   theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor
   control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for
   supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based
   data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the
   sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data
   association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of
   the reward function by using the results of the proposed
   data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control
   action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Prototyping a Digital Twin for Real Time Remote Control Over Mobile
   Networks: Application of Remote Surgery}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{20325-20336}},
Abstract = {{The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of
   future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry
   4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface
   description related to a product or process available through a single
   interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment.
   However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future
   application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for
   specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We
   developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of
   communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks
   supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high
   levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject
   for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised
   of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over
   a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the
   system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a
   network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and
   attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization
   within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is
   limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from
   the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could
   be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for
   communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies
   that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we
   concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development
   in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own
   tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a
   potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and
   similar concepts.}},

Abstract = {{The increased rate of cyber-attacks on the power system necessitates the

   tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are

Abstract = {{The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires
   industrial production towards digitalization to improve network
   efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the
   digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical
   objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very
   challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and
   resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be
   efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy
   consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article,
   we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network
   topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we
   formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation
   problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated
   problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov
   optimization technique to transform the original problem into a
   deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous
   actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation
   offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed
   scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.}},

Abstract = {{The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object,
   which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The
   DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle
   that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a
   production system and its components. A methodology design using
   model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being
   both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels:
   first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide
   basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication,
   security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and
   simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical
   composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on
   these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed
   using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that
   supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A
   case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated
   with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are
   described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify
   that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment
   process of a DT.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in energy-saving technology is main way to achieve carbon
   neutrality. With the development of digital twin, building the
   physical-virtual data space for improving energy management capacity of
   enterprises has received tremendous attention. The energy behaviour
   model implementing accurate simulation and prediction of energy state is
   the core meta-model of energy-efficient manufacturing digital twin
   (EMDT). The widely used state-based energy modelling assumes constant
   power in operation state and approximately fits the energy behaviour
   without considering uncertain operation environment, resulting in energy
   behaviour distortion. A data-driven hybrid petri-net (DDHPN) inspired by
   both the state-based energy modelling and machine learning was developed
   for establishing the energy behaviour meta-model. Gaussian kernel
   extreme learning machine is proposed to fit the instantaneous firing
   speed of energy consumption continuous transitions in DDHPN. DDHPN-based
   energy behaviour model is driven by physical data under real-time
   working conditions, operating parameters, and production load for
   generating a virtual data space of energy management. Finally, DDHPN was
   integrated into the EMDT model using unified modelling language. The
   application in extrusion process and die casting process show that the
   presented model has higher accuracy in energy behaviour prediction.
   Furthermore, a digital-twin-based energy management prototype system for
   extrusion workshop demonstrates its potential. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The comprehensive effect of multiple factors that include the geometric
   characteristics, load status, service characteristics, and failure
   mechanism will affect the safety of bridge crane structure. To evaluate
   the security of the bridge crane structure, the real-time prediction
   method of fatigue life of the bridge structure based on digital twin is
   proposed. The specific type of general bridge crane is selected as the
   physical entity of the research object, and the information acquisition
   system is utilized to get the current service status information about
   the physical entity. On this basis, combined with the historical service
   information and inherent information of physical entity, the fuzzy
   database is established. Meanwhile, twin data are formed by the clear
   quantification of fuzzy information and data processing technology. In
   accordance with structural characteristic and work cycle process of
   bridge crane, the analytical models of load, strength, defect, and
   fatigue life are established, respectively. The multi-theoretical
   calculation model is completed by encapsulating the analysis models and
   transmitting information, and then the main factors affecting the
   fatigue life of bridge crane structure are determined. With that, the
   comprehensive evaluation coefficient is calculated by the fuzzy
   comprehensive evaluation theory. The response relationship between the
   information data and the fatigue life of bridge crane structure is
   described by the Kriging surrogate model constructed with experimental
   design. Real-time prediction of fatigue life of bridge crane structure
   is realized in a virtual space to depict the life cycle process. Taking
   QD20/10 t x 43 m x 12 m general bridge crane as an example, the
   feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are verified, which
   provides a strong theoretical basis for dependable service and timely
   scrapping of cranes.}},

   Factories of the Future}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Featured Application This work was elaborated in the frame of a
   collaborative innovation project named CyberFactory\#1 which aims at
   enhancing optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. Its
   outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial
   use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors
   such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication,
   consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is
   provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace
   System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is
   being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named
   Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing
   assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual
   assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their
   applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches
   are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and
   interdependencies between different production assets are commonly
   ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose
   innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash
   novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a
   holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented
   by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and
   simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including
   external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel
   approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for
   security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital
   Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of
   Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a
   specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System
   Manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Digital twins (DT) have been proposed to support and enhance
   manufacturing processes of the industries. The outcome of adopting DT is
   so encouraging that it is hoped that more than 50\% of the large
   industries will benefit from DT by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, DT
   lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers
   for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated
   structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure
   and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain
   technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers
   from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum
   attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely
   twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction
   confirmation. This article also presents a framework for deployment of
   twinchain for manufacturing of a robot surgical machine.}},

Title = {{Digital Twin for the Oil and Gas Industry: Overview, Research Trends,
   Opportunities, and Challenges}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{104175-104197}},
Abstract = {{With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O\&G) industry is
   now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity,
   efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and
   operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the
   O\&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows
   O\&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets.
   Considering DT adoption, the O\&G industry is still at an early stage
   with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications
   instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT
   implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related
   technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology,
   the current status of O\&G-related DT research activities, and the
   opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the
   O\&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this
   understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the
   context of the O\&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to
   select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based
   publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as
   Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered
   articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant
   Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and
   conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study.
   These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were
   thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology
   and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of
   DT deployment in the O\&G industry. From this literature review, it was
   found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle
   management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O\&G
   industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty
   in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O\&G
   industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT
   related research in the O\&G industry, the United States (US) is the
   leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China,
   Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall
   publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year
   until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The
   number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of
   conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented
   theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both
   these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O\&G
   industry is still at an early stage.}},

   Continuous Lifecycle Integration}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Hospital buildings usually contain sophisticated facility systems and
   special medical equipment, strict security requirements, and business
   systems. Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of
   real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing
   innovations both in technique and management-a ``continuous lifecycle
   integration{''} method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and
   ``early movement{''} of the general contractor, this paper reported a
   successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized
   continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of
   more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O\&M
   phase up to the O\&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time
   visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was
   developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have
   the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual
   management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation
   suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building
   to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in
   the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy
   consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested
   repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.}},

Title = {{Automated Container Terminal Production Operation and Optimization via
   an AdaBoost-Based Digital Twin Framework}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{2021}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Digital twin (DT), machine learning, and industrial Internet of things
   (IIoT) provide great potential for the transformation of the container
   terminal from automation to intelligence. The production control in the
   loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs)
   involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for
   efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and
   security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost
   algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of
   physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the
   twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed
   framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is
   first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a
   random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best
   algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the
   experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than
   others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean
   square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we
   implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate
   the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of
   the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading
   efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing
   by 23.34\% and 31.46\% in small-scale and large-scale problems,
   respectively. Moreover, the visualization service provided by the DT
   system can monitor the status of automation equipment in real time to
   ensure the safety of operation.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2022}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This contribution presents a model for cyber-resilience of critical
   cyber infrastructures (CCI) based on the implementation of a digital
   twin. It addresses the risks associated with the in-tegration of
   computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus
   specifi-cally on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to
   its salience and to the poten-tial risks associated to failures in
   guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on in-formation
   security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational
   pic-ture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs' actors
   with increased cyber sit-uational awareness, common understanding of
   incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the
   model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of
   cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop
   a process model and validate three design propositions through a
   formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in
   the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this
   model for further research as well as practical applications for the
   electrical power sector. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) in Germany-or Industrial Internet 4.0, as it is
   called internationally-are key initiatives in order to bring
   digitization into the automation domain by taking advantage of recent
   technology advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The core
   concept for I4.0 is the digital twin or asset administration shell
   (AAS), as it is called by the German Plattform Industrie 4.0 initiative.
   It shall provide a machine-readable description of I4.0 components,
   being available over the entire lifecycle and being used for various
   advanced use cases and services.
   Security has been an increasingly known and needed aspect during the
   last years and is a key requirement to make I4.0 actually happen. In a
   previous paper we proposed concepts for integrating authorization
   tightly into OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)-based information models.
   OPC UA is a new and promising industrial technology, which could be used
   to implement AAS concepts. The current proposals for AAS define
   necessary security concepts; however, there is no work explaining how
   these concepts can be implemented in OPC UA. This paper closes this gap
   by elaborating on realization alternatives in OPC UA. Furthermore, we
   extend our basic performance evaluation with more realistic data access
   patterns based on I4.0 use cases, showing the applicability of our
   approach in practice.}},

Title = {{Metrics development and modelling the mixed reality and digital twin
   adoption in the context of Industry 4.0}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{1355-1376}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper aims to examine the current technology acceptance
   model (TAM) in the field of mixed reality and digital twin (MRDT) and
   identify key factors affecting users' intentions to use MRDT. The
   factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive
   model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users.
   This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
   Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was
   adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis
   of secondary data contained within published journal articles that
   focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items
   for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to
   meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were
   included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path
   coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b)
   test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the
   database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to
   2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly
   used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social
   influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived
   enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and
   behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the
   general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other
   important factors such as ``perceived immersion{''} could be added to
   the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to
   utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction
   project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic
   construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect
   employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The
   extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers
   or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of
   MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent
   due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and
   empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies
   which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality
   (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies
   may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer
   time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development
   in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a
   theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the
   individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research
   related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing
   managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to
   expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A
   set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will
   help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider
   acceptance.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{179}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Aircraft spare parts inventory management (ASPM) has played a critical
   role in tracing and tracking spare parts as any related maintenance or
   movement shall be recorded. Traceability and trackability of data ensure
   the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air
   Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of
   quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part's life cycle,
   leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance
   error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid
   increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts
   multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking
   operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information
   security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a
   managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability
   data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger
   Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based
   on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction
   operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing
   platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and
   operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and
   security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised
   ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and
   reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The
   enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the
   digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{211}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this research is the in-situ detection of flaw formation in
   metal parts made using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive
   manufacturing process. This is an important area of research, because,
   despite the considerable cost and time savings achieved,
   precision-driven industries, such as aerospace and biomedical, are
   reticent in using LPBF to make safety-critical parts due to tendency of
   the process to create flaws. Another emerging concern in LPBF, and
   additive manufacturing in general, is related to cyber security -
   malicious actors may tamper with the process or plant flaws inside a
   part to compromise its performance. Accordingly, the objective of this
   work is to develop and apply a physics and data integrated strategy for
   online monitoring and detection of flaw formation in LPBF parts. The
   approach used to realize this objective is based on combining (twinning)
   in-situ meltpool temperature measurements with a graph theory-based
   thermal simulation model that rapidly predicts the temperature
   distribution in the part (thermal history). The novelty of the approach
   is that the temperature distribution predictions provided by the
   computational thermal model were updated layer-by-layer with in-situ
   meltpool temperature measurements. This digital twin approach is applied
   to detect flaw formation in stainless steel (316L) impeller-shaped parts
   made using a commercial LPBF system. Four such impellers are produced
   emulating three pathways of flaw formation in LPBF parts, these are:
   changes in the processing parameters (process drifts); machine-related
   malfunctions (lens delamination), and deliberate tampering with the
   process to plant flaws inside the part (cyber intrusions). The severity
   and nature of the resulting flaws, such as porosity and microstructure
   heterogeneity, are characterized ex-situ using X-ray computed
   tomography, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and electron
   backscatter diffraction. The digital twin approach is shown to be
   effective for detection of the three types of flaw formation causes
   studied in this work. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for
   manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However,
   most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of
   Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor
   flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to
   support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article
   combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel
   manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the
   configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then,
   hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are
   designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of
   IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is
   presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT
   with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the
   autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an
   MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the
   proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment
   demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and
   decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive
   throughput and latency performance.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent studies in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) focus on
   monitoring human movement and capturing data for further processing and
   analysis. However, there is a lack of studies that address the
   configurability and modularity of these systems, which is important for
   designing customized systems with customized devices. We propose a
   solution to solve this through a modular framework that automatically
   recognizes and configures new devices and provides real-time data
   wirelessly. The proposed framework creates a Digital Twin of the
   physical device and mirrors its attributes and sensory information into
   the cyber world so they can be used in real-time and post-routine
   analysis. As a proof of concept, a configurable CPS model for physical
   activities monitoring is designed and implemented. The designed gait
   monitoring and analysis system delivers spatiotemporal data from
   multiple multi-sensory devices to a central data handling and backup
   cloud server over conventional IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi. An experiment involving
   a young athlete examined whether or not the CPS components would
   recognize each other over foreign networks and communicate accurate
   information.}},

Title = {{Safe and secure platooning of Automated Guided Vehicles in Industry 4.0}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{121}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are widely used for materials
   transportation. Operating them in a platooned manner has the potential
   to improve safety, security and efficiency, control overall traffic flow
   and reduce resource usage. However, the published studies on platooning
   focus mainly on the design of technical solutions in the context of
   automotive domain. In this paper we focus on a largely unexplored theme
   of platooning in production sites transformed to the Industry 4.0, with
   the aim of providing safety and security assurances. We present an
   overall approach for a fault- and threat tolerant platooning for
   materials transportation in production environments. Our functional use
   cases include the platoon control for collision avoidance, data
   acquisition and processing by considering range, and connectivity with
   fog and cloud levels. To perform the safety and security analyses, the
   Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and Threat and Operability (THROP)
   techniques are used. Based on the results obtained from them, the safety
   and security requirements are derived for the identification and
   prevention/mitigation of potential platooning hazards, threats and
   vulnerabilities. The assurance cases are constructed to show the
   acceptable safety and security of materials transportation using AGV
   platooning. We leveraged a simulation-based digital twin for performing
   the verification and validation as well as finetuning of the platooning
   strategy. Simulation data is gathered from digital twin to monitor
   platoon operations, identify unexpected or incorrect behaviour, evaluate
   the potential implications, trigger control actions to resolve them, and
   continuously update assurance cases. The applicability of the AGV
   platooning is demonstrated in the context of a quarry site.}},

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{The previous applications of new digital methods (BIM) in infrastructure
   construction have led to the realization that merely a building
   information model is not sufficient for the ambitious goals of an
   optimized planning process and, as a result, optimized construction
   management. Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and
   that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in
   underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the
   structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to
   map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the
   ideal case of a ``digital twin{''}. The modeling of the ground goes
   beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do
   justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and
   characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major
   international projects clearly show that the optimization of
   construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment
   and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the
   production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and
   schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the
   introduction of an infrastructure information model, which contains the
   three submodels ground, building and construction site. The main focus
   will be on underground construction, more precisely on mechanized
   tunnelling.}},

   Enterprises}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, Australian SMEs are steadily becoming more digitally
   engaged, but they still face issues and barriers to fully adopt Industry
   4.0 (I4.0). Among the tools that I4.0 encompasses, digital twin (DT) and
   digital thread (DTH) technologies hold significant interest and value.
   Some of the challenges are the lack of expertise in developing the
   communication framework required for data collection, processing, and
   storing; concerns about data and cyber security; lack of knowledge of
   the digitization and visualisation of data; and value generation for
   businesses from the data. This article aims to demonstrate the
   feasibility of DT implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs) by developing a framework based on simple and low-cost solutions
   and providing insight and guidance to overcome technological barriers.
   To do so, this paper first outlines the theoretical framework and its
   components, and subsequently discusses a simplified and generalised DT
   model of a real-world physical asset that demonstrates how these
   components function, how they are integrated and how they interact with
   each other. An experimental scenario is presented to transform data
   harvested from a resistance temperature detector sensor connected with a
   WAGO 750-8102 Programmable Logic Controller for data storage and
   analysis, predictive simulation and modelling. Our results demonstrate
   that sensor data could be readily integrated from Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) devices and enabling DT technologies, where users could view real
   time data and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the form of a 3D
   model. Data from both the sensor and 3D model are viewable in a
   comprehensive history log through a database. Via this technological
   demonstration, we provide several recommendations on software, hardware,
   and expertise that SMEs may adopt to assist with their DT
   implementations.</p>}},

Abstract = {{A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system
   interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged.
   Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one
   of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently,
   the training of students and professionals has to address these new
   demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational
   tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that
   implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as
   connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the
   cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity
   measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational
   environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies
   reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes
   cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an
   industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen
   cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to
   transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and
   analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set
   of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been
   proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the
   enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real
   automation. This course has been taught in a master's degree and
   students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey.
   The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the
   students' and faculty's viewpoint.}},

Title = {{A data-driven operational model for traffic at the Dallas Fort Worth
   International Airport}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{94}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Airports are on the front line of significant innovations, allowing the
   movement of more people and goods faster, cheaper, and with greater
   convenience. As air travel continues to grow, airports will face
   challenges in responding to increasing passenger vehicle traffic, which
   leads to lower operational efficiency, poor air quality, and security
   concerns. This paper evaluates methods for traffic demand forecasting
   combined with traffic microsimulation, which will allow airport
   operations staff to accurately predict traffic and congestion. Using two
   years of detailed data describing individual vehicle arrivals and
   departures, aircraft movements, and weather at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
   International Airport, we evaluate multiple prediction methods including
   the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) family of models,
   traditional machine learning models, and DeepAR, a modern recurrent
   neural network (RNN). We find that these algorithms are able to capture
   the diurnal trends in the surface traffic, and all do very well when
   predicting the next 30 minutes of demand. Longer forecast horizons are
   moderately effective, demonstrating the challenge of this problem and
   highlighting promising techniques as well as potential areas for
   improvement. Traffic demand is not the only factor that contributes to
   terminal congestion, because temporary changes to the road network, such
   as a lane closure, can make benign traffic demand highly congested.
   Combining a demand forecast with a traffic microsimulation framework
   provides a complete picture of traffic and its consequences. The result
   is an operational intelligence platform for exploring policy changes, as
   well as infrastructure expansion and disruption scenarios. To
   demonstrate the value of this approach, we present results from a case
   study at DFW Airport assessing the impact of a policy change for vehicle
   routing in high demand scenarios. This framework can assist airports
   like DFW as they tackle daily operational challenges, as well as explore
   the integration of emerging technology and expansion of their services
   into long term plans.}},

Abstract = {{Industry 4.0 has risen as an integrated digital manufacturing
   environment, and it has created a novel research perspective that has
   thrust research to interdisciplinarity and exploitation of ICT advances.
   This work presents and discusses the main aspects of Industry 4.0 and
   how intelligence can be embedded in manufacturing to create the smart
   factory. It briefly describes the main components of Industry 4.0, and
   it focuses on the security challenges that the fully interconnected
   ecosystem of Industry 4.0 has to meet and the threats for each
   component. Preserving security has a crucial role in Industry 4.0, and
   it is vital for its existence, so the main research directions on how to
   ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information shared among
   the Industry 4.0 components are presented. Another view is in light of
   the security issues that come as a result of enabling new technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Featured Application
   Perimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous
   vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles.
   Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in
   the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system
   life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts.
   The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to
   efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use
   digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative
   evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system
   performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE
   experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current
   testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a
   smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios,
   connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation
   engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been
   successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security
   system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for
   autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated
   and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system
   behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and
   conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop
   control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are
   presented along with a discussion of future directions.}},

   Twins and Artificial Intelligence}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large
   scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control
   requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel
   structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and
   artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of
   prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is
   proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and
   DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion
   mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive
   intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In
   addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent
   control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By
   considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the
   tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing
   the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent
   tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent
   tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and
   intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional
   integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of
   the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of
   digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the
   intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses
   on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance.
   This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI
   in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.}},

Title = {{Additive Manufacturing Cyber-Physical System: Supply Chain Cybersecurity
   and Risks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{47322-47333}},
Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient
   and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the
   freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and
   pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM
   have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid
   growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general
   characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain
   models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of
   the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply
   chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the
   virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively
   manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain
   (<italic>digital thread</italic>) with the physical supply chain and
   their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical
   system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of
   a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible
   attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse
   engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk
   classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity
   methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that
   threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing
   solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In
   providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies
   of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate
   the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further,
   we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and
   identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G
   deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish
   a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research.
   In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication
   needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of
   connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true
   representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial
   and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical,
   biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will
   shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new
   man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices
   acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among
   multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to
   create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv)
   precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With
   rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to
   become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data,
   compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving
   superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other
   major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i)
   cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the
   integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system
   definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on
   latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms
   involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security
   and privacy schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply
   chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including
   those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical
   supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials
   increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors
   like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair
   practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of
   lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of
   food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through
   challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and
   contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and
   survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent
   hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the
   system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world
   implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and
   detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in
   using it to serve their communities.}},

Title = {{A Systematic Literature Review on RAMS analysis for critical
   infrastructures protection}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety/Security (RAMS)
   analysis of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) can be applied to investigate
   their performance subjected to failure modes. The literature has
   witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the
   integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to
   develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant
   aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In
   recent times, digital components and systems com-prising information and
   communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster
   protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a
   considerable cost, such as the necessity to in-tegrate innovative
   cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities,
   efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development,
   resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current
   knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
   focused on address-ing integrated protection aspects, recent
   developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs.
   Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing
   studies dealing with devel-oping techniques, methodologies, protocols,
   models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR
   followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between
   2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212
   records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally,
   after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19
   articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a com-parative
   analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in
   different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies,
   performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenar-ios, targeted
   applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects
   associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is
   an emerging research area, with currently focused appli-cations
   including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing,
   maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8\% of the
   studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining
   approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis.
   Also, 84.2\% of the included studies focus on integrating only three
   aspects of CIs protection. Finally, the open research chal-lenges and
   limitations of existing studies and their respective emerging solutions
   are presented.
