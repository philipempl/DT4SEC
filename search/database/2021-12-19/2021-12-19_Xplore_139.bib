abstract={The ANGEL Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical System Security is a novel approach for improving the security of critical and non-critical infrastructure. Digital Twin technology, widely used in the aviation, manufacturing and automotive industries, has the potential to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the Digital Twin to the application of microgrid security. The Digital Twin is a real-time, physics-based simulation that runs alongside the physical system providing for its constant monitoring and control. The Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems, or ANGEL, will model both the cyber and physical layers of the microgrid and provide real-time data visualization. As a result, users will be aided in assessing the health of the physical plant and overall behavior over a range of operating conditions. The ANGEL Digital Twin will be able to use the real-time two-way coupling between the simulation and physical system to update and evolve the simulation to provide greater insight into the physical system. Ultimately ANGEL will provide the ability to diagnose and heal the physical system, mitigating both component failures and the effects of cyber attack. This paper will explain the methodology behind the design of this digital twin and the advantages of such an approach. To demonstrate the current capabilities of the ANGEL framework as a Level III digital twin, a simulation example is presented on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark.},

While the approach so far has gained interest mainly due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations, recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention within the research community.

We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other security components of the architecture. We also make performance evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using the proposed digital twin design.

abstract={The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of digital twin in IoT. In this paper, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through access point (AP) to help resource limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.},

abstract={The scale and complexity of cyber threats in digital enterprises hamper operators' ability to gather, prioritize and rationalize which security controls requirements should be handled first to achieve rapid risk reduction. This paper presents a cyber digital twin, based on attack graph analytics, that automatically gathers and prioritizes security controls requirements at scale over active networks. The first-of-a-kind twin collects information about the computer network, associates it with attack tactics, measures the efficiency of implemented security controls requirements and automatically detects missing security controls. The twin also evaluates a cyber risk value using the attack graph and proposes prioritization of the detected requirements to rapidly reduce risk within existing system constraints. The cyber digital twin simulator offers several new risk reduction methods for automatically selecting security controls requirements. The necessary data for constructing a contextual cyber digital twin is defined, including the relationship between security controls and attack tactics. The paper illustrates the calculations used for ranking security controls' risk impact, the algorithm for security controls' requirements prioritization, and finally demonstrates successful results using a field experiment conducted via an active network.},

abstract={Increased outsourcing of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and fabrication combined with malicious hardware security threats such as contactless optical probing have greatly decreased an attacker’s difficulty in reverse engineering or maliciously modifying a given circuit. This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample’s ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.},

abstract={The emergence of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DTENs) achieves the mapping of real physical entities to digital models of cyberspace. By offloading real-time mobile data to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers for processing and modeling, communication-efficient Digital Twin (DT) services could be achieved. However, the spatio-temporal dynamic DT service demand stochastically generated by mobile users easily causes service congestion, which challenges the long-term DT service stability. Meanwhile, current DT services still lack long-term effective incentive designs for participants. To solve these issues, we design an incentive-based congestion control scheme for stochastic demand response in DTENs. First, we adopt the Lyapunov optimization theory to decompose the long-term congestion control decision into a sequence of online edge association decisions, with no need for future system information. We then present a contract-based incentive design to optimize the long-term profit of the DT service provider, comprehensively considering the delay sensitivity, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme with the base station dataset of Shanghai Telecom. Theoretical and simulation analysis demonstrates that compared with benchmarks, our scheme could effectively avoid long-term service congestion with an arbitrarily near-optimal profit.},

The trend is headed towards automation and connectivity. In the automotive industry, advancements have been made towards integrating autonomous driving vehicles into Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with the use of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). The purpose of this type of network is to enable efficient communication between vehicles ( V2V communication) or vehicles and infrastructure (V2I communication), to improve driving safety, to avoid traffic congestion, and to better coordinate transport networks. This direction towards limited (or lack of) human intervention implies vulnerability to cyber attacks.

abstract={Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning methods.},

abstract={Smart inverters connected to a communication network are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, a self-security approach is implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. The digital twin is formed using the inverter’s normal operating region and the inverter’s dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates how the inverter’s normal operating region and dynamic model are formed. In particular, the normal operation region is experimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 1.5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter and a 12-kW NHR 9410 regenerative power grid emulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique can potentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks by examining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter’s digital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.},

Although several cloud computing and digital twin based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been proposed, none of them has considered the data privacy issue, yet the leakage of the private healthcare information may cause catastrophic losses to patients. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving similarity query based healthcare monitoring scheme over digital twin cloud platform, named PSim-DTH. Specifically, we first formalize a similarity query based healthcare monitoring model over digital twin cloud platform. Then, we deploy a partition-based tree (PB-tree) to index the healthcare data and introduce matrix encryption to propose a privacy-preserving PB-tree based similarity range query (PSRQ) algorithm. Based on PSRQ algorithm, we propose our PSim-DTH scheme. Both security analysis and performance evaluation are extensively conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed PSim-DTH scheme is really privacy-preserving and efficient.},

abstract={In the field of indoor monitoring, to analyze the track data collected by RFID readers effectively and intuitively is the critical issue. The indoor environment is usually crowded with a large number of flexible and mobile obstacles. The movements of obstacles always change the road network structure. To analyze the trajectories under the labile road network constrains is the key problem. To solve this problem, we propose a trajectory clustering method based on digital-twin technology called DTCluster. The proposed digital-twin model is a virtual digital model, which can extract and display the changing road network structure through real-time mapping and virtual simulation functions. In our paper, the original CFSFDP algorithm is improved to reduce the influence of the track missing points and to enhance the clustering effect in the face of unequal trajectories in length. We also take two parameters: the speed and the direction of moving targets into account. The trajectory clustering results in our DTCluster follow the changing road network for synchronous display on the proposed digital-twin model. It is convenient and effective for researchers to use DTCluster to find the problems which cannot be observed in the clustering results displayed in original planned road network. These problems can only be observed in the current changed road network environment. In our paper, we demonstrate the validity and intuition of DTCluster byexprimental results.},

abstract={With the new industrial revolution of digital transformation, more intelligence and autonomous systems can be adopted in the manufacturing transportation processes. Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry.},

abstract={Emerging Digital Twin (DT) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) are crucial for enabling rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works ignore the edge collaboration which can provide the system with additional performance gain. In this paper, we study the problem of Mobile Users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative Mobile Edge Servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a DT-assisted Task Offloading Scheme (DTTOS) which consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel State Information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two sub-optimization models and solved by Decision Tree Algorithm (DTA) and Double Deep-Q-Learning (DDQN) respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.},

abstract={Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360° camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360° live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360° web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.},

The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration.

abstract={Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.},

abstract={The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.},

Agile Security models different types of security requirements into the context of an attack graph, containing business process targets and critical assets identification, configuration items, and possible impacts of cyber-attacks. By simulating and analyzing virtual adversary attack paths toward cardinal assets, Agile Security examines the business impact on business processes and prioritizes surgical requirements. Thus, handling these requirements backlog that are constantly evaluated as an outcome of employing Agile Security, gradually increases system hardening, reduces business risks and informs the IT service desk or Security Operation Center what remediation action to perform next. Once remediated, Agile Security constantly recomputes residual risk, assessing risk increase by threat intelligence or infrastructure changes versus defender's remediation actions in order to drive overall attack surface reduction.},

abstract={The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.},

abstract={In this paper the general susceptibilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) against modern-cyber threats are explored and potential solutions proposed. This is achieved by applying digital-twin architectures and data-driven methods to UAVs to facilitate identification of real-time intrusions and anomalies. These concepts are validated by performing novelty detection on open access UAV flight data with GPS spoofing attacks, which represents a typical system use-case. Multiple machine learning models are trained to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting modern cyber-intrusions and anomalies using the digital-twin architecture. This includes both classical and deep learning techniques to help identify the most suitable model types for the proposed design. The overall results are positive and help highlight the potential of digital-twin architectures for the UAV contexts.},

abstract={The great progress in the field of digitization and networking of the industry brings many advantages as well as new challenges. On the one hand, it enables new business models that hold great economic growth potential. On the other hand, it leads to an increased heterogeneity of the resulting value- added networks. This poses a striking problem when it comes to the interconnection of industrial devices and the establishment of new business models. Since the disadvantages can quickly outweigh the advantages, activities in this area proceed still very cautiously. A solution is offered by highly dynamic attribute-based usage control architectures at network-level, which monitor the entire communication in the value-added networks. Previous approaches, however, either have the disadvantage that they can only use communication metadata as attributes, or are highly specialized and tailored to the respective systems of the individual network nodes. In addition, they are usually pure access control systems instead of usage control systems. In this paper, the authors propose a novel attribute-based usage control model (ABUC) that allows simulation models in form of digital twins of the respective network components to be used in order to predict their behavior and thus control network traffic according to predicted usage. The ABUC model is then implemented in a use case and validated with several performance tests.},

abstract={As drone technology passes one milestone after the other, drones are used in an ever-increasing number of applications and are now considered as an integral part of the future smart city infrastructure. At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.},

abstract={The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communications will provide a wide range of new applications and business opportunities, but with a wide and quite complex attack surface. Several users are not aware of the underlying threats and most of them do not possess the knowledge to set and operate the various digital assets securely. Therefore, cyber security training is becoming mandatory both for simple users and security experts. Cyber ranges constitute an advance training technique where trainees gain hands-on experiences on a safe virtual environment, which can be a realistic digital twin of an actual system. This paper presents the cyber ranges platform THREAT-ARREST. Its design is fully model-driven and offers all modern training features (i.e. emulation, simulation, serious games, and fabricated data).

abstract={With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.},

abstract={Rapid advancements in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) capabilities have motivated farmers to deploy this ecosystem on their farms. However, there is a growing concern among users regarding the security risks associated with CPS. Especially with rising number of cyber-attacks on CPS, such as modifying sensor readings, interrupting operations, etc. Therefore, this paper describes a security surveillance framework to detect deviations in the ecosystem by incorporating a digital twin supported anomaly detection model. The reason for incorporating digital twins is that they add value by enabling real-time monitoring of connected smart farms. We pre-process the collected data from sensors deployed on the smart farm setup. The pre-processed data is fused with our smart farm ontology to populate a knowledge graph. The generated graph is further queried to extract the necessary sensor data. We utilize the extracted normal data to train the anomaly detection model. Further, we tested our model if it identifies abnormal values from sensors by simulating anomalous use case scenarios specific to our ecosystem.},

This paper focuses on a service based interaction of MES and process control in a modular an interconnected environment to promote process optimization. Another important factor that must be considered is security. Linking the industrial automation with IT technologies is a basis for optimization and digitalization but it exposes the system to security threats. Retrieving process information for further data processing and online system optimization including the controlled process must be accomplished via an approach that ensures the security requirements of the system.

In order to prove the concept, a case study where the digital twin of an industrial ice cream machine (as an example of an eGastronomic thing) is presented. The ice cream machine and its 3D digital twin can be visualized in a 3D virtual environment which enables interaction through AR or VR.

The concept is to use the estimated grid impedance as the parameter to identify the difference between normal operation and islanding scenarios. Selecting arbitrary initial values, the digital twin approximates the response of the actual system and therefore a value for the system impedance.

In this work, we leverage the digital twin(DT) concept to help the information fusion and computing for AV, propose a vehicular digital twin(VDT) framework. Specifically, DT is maintained in the cloud and synchronized with its corresponding AV in real-time. AV uploads necessary information to the DT, and DT makes feedback through processing and analysis. The DT can also communicate with other DTs to obtain information. Due to the real-time information synchronization of AV and DT in an open communication environment, ensuring communication security and protect privacy is needed. To tackle those issues, we give a concrete authentication protocol for secure communication between AV and DT. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed protocol not only has less computation cost but also can satisfy the necessary security requirements.},

Furthermore, field running test on this system was carried out in the Measurement Center of Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau, and it verified that the system had the ability to collect data in seconds. the simulation results were analyzed to adjust collection time interval taking load forecasting and spot trading business as examples, using forecast accuracy and power purchase cost as indicators. Finally, it is determined that when the collection frequency is one minute, it could meet the indicator that the average absolute percentage error of load forecast was less than 1%. And in the meantime, the purchase cost deviation of the electricity sellers was much smaller than the 2% error specified by the standard.},

abstract={Autonomous systems have the potential to accomplish missions more quickly and effectively, while reducing risks to human operators and costs. However, since the use of autonomous systems is still relatively new, there are still a lot of challenges associated with trusting these systems. Without operators in direct control of all actions, there are significant concerns associated with endangering human lives or damaging equipment. For this reason, NATO has issued a challenge seeking to identify ways to improve decision-maker and operator trust when deploying autonomous systems, and de-risk their adoption. This paper presents the proposal of the winning solution to this NATO challenge. It approaches trust as a multi-dimensional concept, by incorporating the four dimensions of human-agent trust establishment in a digital twin context.},

abstract={Due to the increasing automation and digitalization level in modern semiconductor wafer facilities and the associated growing system complexity, the demands for the maintenance staff for highly automated systems are continuously increasing. In order to maintain line stability, qualified maintenance personnel are essential for fast and secure troubleshooting the highly automated transportation system of a semiconductor plant. However, the transfer of knowledge to new maintenance personnel for coping with malfunctions is a big challenge. This is also a contribution in the digital transformation in this context for training of people at highly digitized workplaces by introducing a virtual training for (new) employees. This training supports new maintenance personnel to gain practical experience in operating a modern human-machine interface without disturbing the existing productive system. Initial results indicate that this approach supports the transformation process in a targeted manner. For future work, we aim to examine other performance metrics and their impact over time.},

A general concept for a physical and cyber event detection is developed as a combination of state-of-the-art disturbance classification and cyber-attack detection methods. This requires the incorporation of heterogeneous data sources and advanced data fusion and analysis techniques. An enhanced and robust recognition of the current grid situation is proposed to distinguish between different scheduled and unscheduled grid events. Furthermore, Digital Twins are considered as new promising technology for control centers and potential benefits for physical and cyber event detection are described.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) play an increasingly significant role in many critical applications. These valuable applications attract various sophisticated attacks. This paper considers a stealthy estimation attack, which aims to modify the state estimation of the CPSs. The intelligent attackers can learn defense strategies and use clandestine attack strategies to avoid detection. To address the issue, we design a Chi-square detector in a Digital Twin (DT), which is an online digital model of the physical system. We use a Signaling Game with Evidence (SGE) to find the optimal attack and defense strategies. Our analytical results show that the proposed defense strategies can mitigate the impact of the attack on the physical estimation and guarantee the stability of the CPSs. Finally, we use an illustrative application to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.},

abstract={The electrical energy system is transforming itself into a sustainable energy supply in response to the decline in fossil fuels. This conversion is driving the expansion of renewable energy facilities such as photovoltaic plants and wind power plants. Except for large hydropower plants and offshore wind farms, the integration of renewable energies takes place predominantly in the medium- and low-voltage distribution networks. This leads to a lack of observability and increasing grid complexity. Consequently, distribution network operators are constantly faced with a challenge in terms of observability. A comprehensive installation of measuring instruments in the medium- and low-voltage networks has proved economically unviable. An alternative approach to network state monitoring within the framework of power grid digital twin (DT) is therefore developed in this paper. The patterns of the electrical energy system are detected and modeled employing an artificial neural network (ANN) in connection with the associated harmonic spectra. Based on this DT model, the active powers of renewable energy facilities are estimated through the measured voltage data. In this regard, this work is first devoted to the modeling of an ANN-based DT estimator. The proposed power state estimation is then validated with the measured data from a field test. The accuracy of the estimation will be investigated according to the different influencing factors.},

abstract={The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article, we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.},

abstract={Digital twins (DT) have been proposed to support and enhance manufacturing processes of the industries. The outcome of adopting DT is so encouraging that it is hoped that more than 50% of the large industries will benefit from DT by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, DT lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction confirmation. This article also presents a framework for deployment of twinchain for manufacturing of a robot surgical machine.},

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) of critical infrastructure are increasingly connected to the Internet for remote site management at scale. However, cyber attacks against ICS - especially at the communication channels between human-machine interface (HMIs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) - are increasing at a rate which outstrips the rate of mitigation. In this paper, we introduce a vendor-agnostic analytics framework which allows security researchers to analyse attacks against ICS systems, even if the researchers have zero control automation domain knowledge or are faced with a myriad of heterogenous ICS systems. Unlike existing works that require expertise in domain knowledge and specialised tool usage, our analytics framework does not require prior knowledge about ICS communication protocols, PLCs, and expertise of any network penetration testing tool. Using `digital twin' scenarios comprising industry-representative HMIs, PLCs and firewalls in our test lab, our framework's steps were demonstrated to successfully implement a stealthy deception attack based on false data injection attacks (FDIA). Furthermore, our framework also demonstrated the relative ease of attack dataset collection, and the ability to leverage well-known penetration testing tools. We also introduce the concept of `heuristic inference attacks', a new family of attack types on ICS which is agnostic to PLC and HMI brands/models commonly deployed in ICS. Our experiments were also validated on a separate ICS dataset collected from a cyber-physical scenario of water utilities. Finally, we utilized time complexity theory to estimate the difficulty for the attacker to conduct the proposed packet analyses, and recommended countermeasures based on our findings.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the secure vehicle communications in cybertwin-enabled integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, where the digital twins (DTs) in the cybertwin space reflects the physical entities (i.e., satellite, terrestrial base station (BS), and vehicles). Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links, it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract={Cybersecurity testing of automotive systems has become a practical necessity, with the wide adoption of advanced driving assistance functions and vehicular communications. These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge.},

abstract={Cybersecurity research regarding the electric power grid has primarily been focused on protecting the communication layer of grid-connected devices against cyber-attack threats. Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.},

abstract={Since its first introduction in 2002, the interest in the concept of "Digital Twins" has grown exponentially among researchers and industry practitioners. An increasing number of Digital Twin implementations are made in many industries. Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed. The results indicate a dearth in the literature focused on the process industry, therefore, key learnings from other industry sectors are gathered, and suggestions for further research are proposed.},

abstract={Attention to cyber security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has led to the development of innovative cyber-resilient methodologies to ensure early detection and mitigation of cyber anomalies and threats. The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.},

abstract={Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However, most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then, hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive throughput and latency performance.},

abstract={With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.},

abstract={Digital technologies nowadays play a crucial role in many aspects of our lives, such as health, work, security, wellbeing, etc. A lot of such technologies are used in conjunction with Cloud Technologies. Cloud Technologies are seen as a pool of (virtually) unlimited amount of computing resources, which can be used on demand as a technical foundation for various “as-a-Service” solutions. But in order to be able to use efficiently this “infinite” amount of resources, special architectural approaches are needed.

DTs of AM systems are proposed in recent literature to provide additional analysis and monitoring capabilities to the physical AM processes. This work proposes a DT framework for real-time performance monitoring and anomaly detection in fused deposition modeling (FDM) AM process. The proposed DT framework can accommodate AM process measurement data to model the AM process as a cyber-physical system with continuous and discrete event dynamics, and allow for the development of various applications. A new performance metric is proposed for performance monitoring and a formal specification based anomaly detection method is proposed for AM processes. Implementation of the proposed DT on an off-the-shelf FDM printer and experimental results of anomaly detection and process monitoring are presented at the end.},

The proposed system makes use of new, more flexible and environmentally friendly means of transport, such as electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft and electric Autonomous ZeroEmission (eAZE) vessels. To meet the environmental targets set out for the transport sector, the use of alternative hydrogen- based fuels is investigated for air, surface and marine vehicles. Logistics, regulations and infrastructure required for the safe and efficient production and distribution of such low-emission energy vectors is also considered.

abstract={The rise of digital twins in the manufacturing industry is accompanied by new possibilities, like process automation and condition monitoring, real time simulations and quality and maintenance prediction are just a few advantages which can be realized. This paper takes a novel approach by extracting the fundamental knowledge of a data set from a production process and mapping it to an expert fuzzy rule set. Afterwards, new fundamental augmented data is generated by exploring the feature space of the previously generated fuzzy rule set. At the same time, a high number of artificial neural network (ANN) models with different hyperparameter configurations are created. The best models are chosen, in line with the idea of survival of the fittest, and improved with the additional training data sets, generated by the fuzzy rule simulation. It is shown that ANN models can be improved by adding fundamental knowledge represented by the discovered fuzzy rules. Those models can represent digitized machines as digital twins. The architecture and effectiveness of the digital twin is evaluated within an industry 4.0 use case.},

abstract={Counterfeiting is a major problem in many industries, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damages every year. Digital twins further increase a product's value, making it critical to secure the link between the physical and digital world. An entire industry has sprung up to address this problem with a wide variety of product-authentication technologies, or crypto anchors, offering many different trade-offs between supported product surface, security level, price sensitivity, ease of use, etc. Each crypto-anchor vendor provides their own APIs for commissioning, verification and monitoring which makes it hard for application developers to support many of them. This paper introduces a platform that provides a generic model of an object secured by a crypto anchor, supporting any number of product authentication technologies by means of crypto-anchor plugins. Applications programmed against this generic model can immediately interoperate with any of the plugged-in crypto anchors. We present a blockchain architecture for the platform whose decentralization matches the highly differentiated industry structure. We've implemented the system on Hyperledger Fabric.},

It also shows the possibility to formalize domain knowledge on new agro technologies for plant growing and automate decision-making processes when introducing precision farming technologies. A formalized model of the digital twin of plants is proposed in the form of a multi-agent state machine, acting on the basis of a knowledge graph of transitions between phases of plant development. Each stage (state) has its own software agent, which helps respond to unforeseen events and recalculate predicted harvest and risks of problem situations. Recommendations developed by the digital twin are to be further sent to smart cyber-physical precision farming management system for adaptive rescheduling of resources and differentiated use of fertilizers and crop protection tools. The developed approach becomes valuable in growing uncertainty because of global climate changes, destroying agronomist domain knowledge collected over centuries.},

In order to create a well synchronized digital-twin simulator in manufacturing, information and activities of a physical machine need to be virtualized. Many existing digital-twins stream read-only data of machine sensors and do not incorporate operations of manufacturing machines through Internet. In this paper, a new method of virtualization is proposed to integrate machining data and operations into the digital-twins using Internet scale machine tool communication method. A fully functional digital-twin is implemented in CPMC testbed using MTComm and several manufacturing application scenarios are developed to evaluate the proposed method and system. Performance analysis shows that it is capable of providing data-driven visual monitoring of a manufacturing process and performing manufacturing operations through digital twins over the Internet. Results of the experiments also shows that the MTComm based digital twins have an excellent efficiency.},

abstract={The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research. In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical, biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv) precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data, compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i) cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security and privacy schemes.},

Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, we leverage Digital Twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs.},

abstract={Human-Cyber-Physical-Systems (HPCS), such as critical infrastructures in modern society, are subject to several systemic threats due to their complex interconnections and interdependencies. Management of systemic threats requires a paradigm shift from static risk assessment to holistic resilience modeling and evaluation using intelligent, data-driven and run-time approaches. In fact, the complexity and criticality of HCPS requires timely decisions considering many parameters and implications, which in turn require the adoption of advanced monitoring frameworks and evaluation tools. In order to tackle such challenge, we introduce those new paradigms in a framework named RESILTRON, envisioning Digital Twins (DT) to support decision making and improve resilience in HCPS under systemic stress. In order to represent possibly complex and heterogeneous HCPS, together with their environment and stressors, we leverage on multi-simulation approaches, combining multiple formalisms, data-driven approaches and Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling paradigms, through a structured, modular and compositional framework. DT are used to provide an adaptive abstract representation of the system in terms of multi-layered spatially-embedded dynamic networks, and to apply self-adaptation to time-warped What-If analyses, in order to find the best sequence of decisions to ensure resilience under uncertainty and continuous HPCS evolution.},

abstract={With the help of modern technologies and advances in communication systems, the functionality of Industrial control systems (ICS) has been enhanced leading toward to have more efficient and smarter ICS. However, this makes these systems more and more connected and part of a networked system. This can provide an entry point for attackers to infiltrate the system and cause damage with potentially catastrophic consequences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin-based security framework for ICS that consists of two parts: attack detection and attack mitigation. In this framework we deploy an intrusion detection system in digital domain that can detect attacks in a timely manner. Then, using our mitigation method, we keep the system stable with acceptable performance during the attack. Additionally, we implement our framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks.},

To achieve this, we see an increase in the convergence of technologies, scientific knowledge and political will, and it is safe to say that in the next few years, there will be new societal trends and challenges in the fields of health, wellness, security, safety, transportation, energy, mobility, and communications. One promising solution to face these challenges is that of Digital Twins. According to Gartner, the digital twin (DT) is in the top 10 technological trends for 2020. More than 50% of IoT companies' teams have a digital twin in their annual plan as a strategic mandate. According to MarketsandMarkets [1], it is expected that the digital twin market will reach US $35.8 billion by 2025.},

abstract={At present, the transition from the traditional scheme of energy supply organization to new technologies and practices, implying decentralization, digitalization and intellectualization systems of energy-saving with the active involvement of consumers in the generation and management of all types of energy resources, is becoming increasingly relevant. According to forecasts of experts given in the study “Distributed energy in Russia: potential for development”, the architecture of a distributed energy (DE) system being created will include the following elements: manageable interfaces, “routers of energy”, and platforms of management and services. Most of the platform solutions being created include only a part of the elements from the list above. Existing solutions in the field of DE are based on algorithms that do not provide the flexibility of decision-making and the proper level of security. The purpose of our work is to develop the concept of the intelligent management system of DE facilities. The principle of modular programming using the kernel expansion method was taken as a basis for the development of the concept. The proposed intelligent management system operates in real-time and allows implementing new algorithms and methods of control of the power system, including the management of its active elements. The subsequent development of the project includes the development of the architecture of the software platform and the implementation of the management system of DE facilities. Using the results of the work will increase the efficiency of management of DE facilities.},

The protocols used in industrial operations and web applications are often contradictory in regards to the latency and security characteristics. Due to these differences, the intersection of operation and information technologies is a challenging area. But the rewards in smoother information flow are also high, providing a fruitful area for development. This paper introduces a general wrapper application to enable the use of the industrial OPC UA server through an interface implemented with web technology GraphQL.

abstract={The Internet of Things builds a digital world where all assets including people, machines, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), processes, services, etc. are internetworked. Digital Twins provide 1-to-1 digital replica of physical assets and enable their networking and their goal-directed and standardized communication. The combination of assets and their corresponding Digital Twins are the “things”, the nodes of the IoT. With the rapid development of IoT and its pertinent technologies, more and more things will be mutually interconnected over the Internet. Hence, the security issues that come with it are gradually becoming sharper and sharper. In this paper, we focus on the topic of the secured communication among things - or more precisely their Digital Twins - and propose an approach related to OAuth2, asymmetrically encryption and digital signing to secure the communication within the newly developed Smart Systems Service Infrastructure (S3I).},

abstract={Background-Photo-realistic terapixel visualization is computationally intensive and to date there have been no such visualizations of urban digital twins, the few terapixel visualizations that exist have looked towards space rather than earth. Objective-our aims are: creating a scalable cloud supercomputer software architecture for visualization; a photo-realistic terapixel 3D visualization of urban IoT data supporting daily updates; a rigorous evaluation of cloud supercomputing for our application. Method-We migrated the Blender Cycles path tracer to the public cloud within a new software framework designed to scale to petaFLOP performance. Results-we demonstrate we can compute a terapixel visualization in under one hour, the system scaling at 98% efficiency to use 1024 public cloud GPU nodes delivering 14 petaFLOPS. The resulting terapixel image supports interactive browsing of the city and its data at a wide range of sensing scales. Conclusion-The GPU compute resource available in the cloud is greater than anything available on our national supercomputers providing access to globally competitive resources. The direct financial cost of access, compared to procuring and running these systems, was low. The indirect cost, in overcoming teething issues with cloud software development, should reduce significantly over time.},

abstract={Throughout the life cycle of any technical project, the enterprise needs to assess the risks associated with its development, commissioning, operation and decommissioning. This article defines the task of researching risks in relation to the operation of a data storage subsystem in the cloud infrastructure of a geographically distributed company and the tools that are required for this. Analysts point out that, compared to 2018, in 2019 there were 3.5 times more cases of confidential information leaks from storages on unprotected (freely accessible due to incorrect configuration) servers in cloud services. The total number of compromised personal data and payment information records increased 5.4 times compared to 2018 and amounted to more than 8.35 billion records. Moreover, the share of leaks of payment information has decreased, but the percentage of leaks of personal data has grown and accounts for almost 90% of all leaks from cloud storage. On average, each unsecured service identified resulted in 33.7 million personal data records being leaked. Leaks are mainly related to misconfiguration of services and stored resources, as well as human factors. These impacts can be minimized by improving the skills of cloud storage administrators and regularly auditing storage. Despite its seeming insecurity, the cloud is a reliable way of storing data. At the same time, leaks are still occurring. According to Kaspersky Lab, every tenth (11%) data leak from the cloud became possible due to the actions of the provider, while a third of all cyber incidents in the cloud (31% in Russia and 33% in the world) were due to gullibility company employees caught up in social engineering techniques. Minimizing the risks associated with the storage of personal data is one of the main tasks when operating a company's cloud infrastructure.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) device data enables diverse applications. However, the quality of data are non-standardized and difficult to quantify. While poor quality data may be usable, establishing error bounds supports IoT's use in critical applications. National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) have long tradition in making measurement data trustworthy, and they are now working to digitalize these practices. This paper forwards that agenda by presenting a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based concept to leverage digital metrology for IoT data and devices. Digital Calibration Certificates (DCCs) offer a solution for describing, certifying, authenticating, and securing IoT data quality. With DCCs, measurement device (sensor) calibration information may be included as metadata alongside samples captured by a device. Metadata may include device identification, which serves as proof-of-origin for measurements and samples, and timing data, to ensure its “freshness.” DCCs enhance communicating the quality of captured information among devices, services, and applications, thereby supporting IoT's use in domains with strict error constraints. Our proposed concept securely validates DCC-based (meta)data traceability chain from NMIs and devices to data end-users with cryptographic measures, rendering IoT data trustworthy for critical applications.},

abstract={A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.},

abstract={The goal is to explore the prediction performance of energy consumption in digital twins of the intelligent factory in the process of urbanization, so that it can provide good guidance for the green development of cities. The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.},

abstract={In recent years, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) came into being. IIoT connects sensors, industrial equipment, products, and staff in the factory, enabling context-awareness and industrial equipment automate control. The identity resolution system is a core infrastructure in IIoT. Similar to the role of Domain Name System (DNS) on the Internet, it is the entrance to the IIoT. The difference between them is their input and output. The input of the identity resolution system in IIoT is an identifier of an object. And the output is the mapping data attached to the identifier, including the product profile, a URL, or the identifier's surrounding environment. However, how to deploy an identity resolution system in IIoT has not yet been conclusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the potential identity resolution systems that may be used in IIoT. Firstly, an overview of the identity resolution system is introduced, including a reference framework that can be used to evaluate an identity resolution system. Then we review some influential identity resolution systems based on this reference framework. After that, we make a comparison from the perspective of whether they can meet IIoT requirements and technology selection. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.},

abstract={Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance on decision-making tasks. Still, it is vulnerable to the backdoor attack because of lacking transparency, which results in unexpected results for the input with a trigger. Backdoors can remain hidden in neural networks for a long time, and the networks implanted with backdoors can still make correct judgments when receiving normal inputs. The most common way to implant backdoors into neural networks is to perform trigger inserting and label modifying in the training dataset so that the trained models naturally carry backdoors. This paper proposes a novel defense method against neural network backdoor attacks, referred to as the backdoor filter. The defense is deployed on the dataset used for model training: It first blurs the dataset images and then performs sharpening operations on the obtained processed intermediate parts. This processed dataset is then used as input to the neural network for model training. We use three different types of backdoor attacks to validate our approach, evaluating the prediction accuracy and the attack's success rate after our processing. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the success rate of the corresponding attacks and effectively defend against backdoor attacks.},

abstract={Beyond fifth generation (B5G) communication networks and computation paradigms in the edge are expected to be integrated into power grid infrastructures over the coming years. In this sense, AI technologies will play a fundamental role to efficiently manage dynamic information flows of future applications, which impacts the authorization policies applied in such a complex scenario. This article studies how digital twins can evolve their context awareness capabilities and simulation technologies to anticipate faults or to detect cyber-security issues in real time, and update access control policies accordingly. Our study analyzes the evolution of monitoring platforms and architecture decentralization, including the application of machine learning and blockchain technologies in the smart grid, toward the goal of implementing autonomous and self-learning agents in the medium and long term. We conclude this study with future challenges on applying digital twins to B5G-based smart grid deployments.},

abstract={Several methods exist for detecting process anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. The assessment of such methods could be conducted using simulation or directly on a realistic operational testbed. While the results of an assessment on a testbed may be more authentic than those carried out using simulation, conducting such experiments is fraught with challenges such as the time required to set up and launch attacks thus limiting the variety and number of attacks launched. To overcome such limitations, while maintaining the reliability of the outcome of the assessment, an approach based on timed automata models of a critical infrastructure was investigated. The investigation involved development of a digital twin for a 6-stage water treatment plant. A design-centric anomaly detection method, as well as an attack launcher, were integrated with the model and experiments were performed. The outcome of this investigation reveals the value of the proposed approach in rapid assessment of a design-centric anomaly detection method.},

abstract={Today "Smart Factories" has paved way for the new industrial revolution called "Industry 4.0 or the Internet of Things (IIOT)". By the implementation of this standard, industrial devices communicate with each other as well as operators, automate processes with little or no human effort, and facilitates real-time manufacturing operation. This intelligent, networked system uses a continuous exchange of data for connected operations and production. To establish a smart manufacturing platform that can enhance the accomplishment of smart factories is vital and desirable for modern manufacturing industries. At the moment, most conventional factories are faced with the challenge of migrating into smart factories, due to their inability to converge information and automation system to perform a real-time operation. This paper studied various articles related to Smart Manufacturing and will discuss some of the challenges with this transformation and propose a 5 stage approach for the transformation of conventional factories to smart factories.},

abstract={Industrial networks - both wired and wireless - have been used by manufacturing plants and factories for many years. These networks are not always considered as primary elements of industrial architecture, although they should be. With the advent of Industry 4.0, there are already many innovation initiatives, industry recommendations, and standards in the topic of industrial network infrastructure - but integration guidelines on Industry 4.0 and the networking architectures are incomplete. In the absence of a better methodology, the networks are usually over-designed, but still rigid and are not ready to cover future needs.This paper aims to provide methods on determining some key parameters of existing industrial traffic. Building upon the state-of-the-art, the paper presents a method for testing and analyzing an existing data transfer network traversing industrial traffic. Furthermore, we provide insights on how it is worth to examine industrial networks, and find out whether a given transmission technology can meet the demands - based on the analysis of existing industrial traffic.},

abstract={As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)-including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics-as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

Information about the health status of patients, their personal data and the results of medical research are classified as confidential information, which is the object of increased attention of cybercriminals. The widespread transformation of healthcare organizations, the creation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystems based on wireless sensor networks are increasing the number of potential risks of confidential information leakage. Medical data requires constant protection. The problem of identifying risks in order to develop methods and tools for their management in the future is further complicated by the fact that Healthcare Industry is increasingly beginning to use the cloud architecture of the IoMT, which in turn increases the potential threats to patients' confidential information. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of ransomware programs that are being introduced into IoMT devices has increased, cyberattacks are becoming more complex with a significantly higher risk of fatal consequences for patients due to changes in the technical parameters of medical equipment by attackers. This makes it urgent to solve the problem of identifying possible risks in IoMT tools and systems, assessing their impact and possible consequences from unauthorized actions of intruders for patients and the medical organization as a whole.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in using it to serve their communities.},

abstract={There have been attempts to improve the operational efficiency of construction projects and plan response countermeasures for estimated damage following disasters through the utilization of accumulated electronic data, which constructs a digital twin that can reproduce a physical space in cyberspace and feedback the cyberspace simulation results to physical space. However, the application of such simulations is limited, unless numerical models can be automatically constructed from the data. In this study, we develop a program that utilizes a data processing platform to read, transform, and integrate data to create mediated data with a common data structure. This mediated data can be used to construct analytical models for various numerical analyses. Using the program developed, a grid model of 3-D ground surface as the mediated data was constructed based on borehole data obtained through a ground survey. Each grid point has basic material parameters of soil, and these parameters are estimated from borehole data and other investigation reports. Each grid point has general geotechnical parameters and can be easily converted to a 3-D finite-element model. When the borehole data is added or changed, the analytical model can be updated with almost no cost, whereas it would be very costly to create the model manually.},

abstract={The digitisation of industry provides a plethora of novel applications that increase flexibility and reduce setup and maintenance time as well as cost. Furthermore, novel use cases are created by the digitisation of industry, commonly known as Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things, applications make use of communication and computation technology that is becoming available. This enables novel business use cases, such as the digital twin, customer individual production, and data market places. However, the inter-connectivity such use cases rely on also significantly increases the attack surface of industrial enterprises. Sabotage and espionage are aimed at data, which is becoming the most crucial asset of an enterprise. Since the requirements on security solutions in industrial networks are inherently different from office networks, novel approaches for intrusion detection need to be developed. In this work, process data of a real water treatment process that contains attacks is analysed. Analysis is performed by an extension of Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series. By extending Matrix Profiles with a Hamming-distance metric, binary and tertiary actuators can be integrated into the analysis in a meaningful fashion. This algorithm requires low training effort while providing accurate results. Furthermore, it can be employed in a real-time fashion. Selected actuators in the data set are analysed to highlight the applicability of the extended Matrix Profiles.},

abstract={Our proposal aims to help solving a trust problem between licensors and licensees that occurs during the active life of license agreements. We particularly focus on licensing of proprietary intellectual property (IP) that is embedded in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services (e.g. patented technologies). To achieve this we propose to encode the logic of license agreements into smart licenses (SL). We define a SL as a `digital twin' of a licensing contract, i.e. one or more smart contracts that represent the full or relevant parts of a licensing agreement in machine readable and executable code. As SL are self enforcing, the royalty computation and execution of payments can be fully automated in a tamper free and trustworthy way. This of course, requires to employ a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Such an Automated Licensing Payment System (ALPS) can thus automate an established business process and solve a longstanding trust issue in licensing markets. It renders traditional costly audits obsolete, lowers entry barriers for those who want to participate in licensing markets, and enables novel business models too complex with traditional approaches.},

abstract={In recent years, human society has been witnessed to evolve fast to the era of big data, rendering the data sharing and privacy protection a key issue for the development of digital economies. Federated learning, as a novel pattern for distributed machine learning, is aimed to train a centralized model from decentralized datasets while protecting user privacy, and is now intensively studied in literature. However, a variety of technical challenges, e.g., security issues, incentive mechanism design, are still awaiting further research efforts. In this respect, blockchain proves to be an elegant solution for federated learning to overcome these issues, and thus has been applied in federated learning in many scenarios with success. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey for blockchain-enabled federated learning, proposed its technical framework and discussed the key research issues. This work represents the first attempt for reviewing the literature aiming at integrating blockchain and federated learning, and can be expected to offer useful guidance for establishing a new infrastructure for decentralized and secured data circulation, as well as promoting the development of related industries.},
