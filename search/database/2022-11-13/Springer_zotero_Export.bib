            Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) serves as an interdisciplinary effort that incorporates cyber vector as well as physical vector. The latter can generate exponentially growing amounts of data. How to process CPS big data systematically and efficiently is the key to the breakthrough of offering prospective and personalized services for each individual user and entity involved. In recent years, much research has been proactively conducted on advancing specific scenario or algorithm. However, few surveys value their integration. For good measure, the synthesis remains a fundamental challenge. Subsequently, we fill the gap in the literature by constructing cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing as a whole to inspire on new architectures and cross utilizations. Moreover, bringing the enthusiasm of traditionally solitude entities into play is crucial. In this exploratory study, we examine definitions of CPS as well as the three aforementioned computing paradigms and then shed new light on comprehensively established frameworks. We also survey on the application level of Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing in CPS respectively and dive into diversified algorithms and strategies to embed big data applications into a more intelligent and convenient society with current deficiencies and future research directions followed.},

            Industry 4.0 aims to transform chemical and biochemical processes into intelligent systems via the integration of digital components with the actual physical units involved. This process can be thought of as addition of a central nervous system with a sensing and control monitoring of components and regulating the performance of the individual physical assets (processes, units, etc.) involved. Established technologies central to the digital integrating components are smart sensing, mobile communication, Internet of Things, modelling and simulation, advanced data processing, storage and analysis, advanced process control, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud computing, and virtual and augmented reality. An essential element to this transformation is the exploitation of large amounts of historical process data and large volumes of data generated in real-time by smart sensors widely used in industry. Exploitation of the information contained in these data requires the use of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies integrated with more traditional modelling techniques. The purpose of this paper is twofold: a) to present the state-of-the-art of the aforementioned technologies, and b) to present a strategic plan for their integration toward the goal of an autonomous smart plant capable of self-adaption and self-regulation for short- and long-term production management.},

            This paper presents a summary of mechanisms for the evolution of artificial intelligence in ‘internet of things’ networks. Firstly, the paper investigates how the use of new technologies in industrial systems improves organisational resilience supporting both a technical and human level. Secondly, the paper reports empirical results that correlate academic literature with Industry 4.0 interdependencies between edge components to both external and internal services and systems. The novelty of the paper is a new approach for creating a virtual representation operating as a real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process (i.e., digital twin) outlined in a conceptual diagram. The methodology applied in this paper resembled a grounded theory analysis of complex interconnected and coupled systems. By connecting the human–computer interactions in different information knowledge management systems, this paper presents a summary of mechanisms for the evolution of artificial intelligence in internet of things networks.},

            Disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major upheavals for manufacturing, and has severe implications for production networks, and the demand and supply chains underpinning manufacturing operations. This paper is the first of its kind to pull together research on both—the pandemic-related challenges and the management interventions in a manufacturing context. This systematic literature review reveals the frailty of supply chains and production networks in withstanding the pressures of lockdowns and other safety protocols, including product and workforce shortages. These, altogether, have led to closed facilities, reduced capacities, increased costs, and severe economic uncertainty for manufacturing businesses. In managing these challenges and stabilising their operations, manufacturers are urgently intervening by—investing in digital technologies, undertaking resource redistribution and repurposing, regionalizing and localizing, servitizing, and targeting policies that can help them survive in this altered economy. Based on holistic analysis of these challenges and interventions, this review proposes an extensive research agenda for future studies to pursue.},

            Current food system evolved in a great degree because of the development of processing and food engineering technologies: people learned to bake bread long before the advent of agriculture; salting and smoking supported nomad lifestyles; canning allowed for longer military marches; etc. Food processing technologies went through evolution and significant optimization and currently rely on minor fraction of energy comparing with initial prototypes. Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies.},

            Digital transformation is of crucial importance in the manufacturing industry, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic because of the increasing need for remote working and socially distanced workplaces. However, there is a lack of a clear and well-defined process to implement digital transformation in manufacturing. This paper aims to identify the most critical stages to implementing digital transformation in the manufacturing sector. Twenty-one structured interviews with experienced specialists in digitalisation in the manufacturing sector in the Egyptian economy were held and used the Best–Worst Method to analyse the data as an analysis tool for a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. The digital transformation process comprises eight stages covering technology, management, communications, and customer elements. The main contribution of this work stage is the balance between the different elements of digital transformation—digital technologies, leadership and strategy, people and business processes—to create an integrated 8-step process of digital transformation in the manufacturing sector of developing economies such as the Egyptian economy.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The transformation of power grids into intelligent cyber-physical systems brings numerous benefits, but also significantly increases the surface for cyber-attacks, demanding appropriate countermeasures. However, the development, validation, and testing of data-driven countermeasures against cyber-attacks, such as machine learning-based detection approaches, lack important data from real-world cyber incidents. Unlike attack data from real-world cyber incidents, infrastructure knowledge and standards are accessible through expert and domain knowledge. Our proposed approach uses domain knowledge to define the behavior of a smart grid under non-attack conditions and detect attack patterns and anomalies. Using a graph-based specification formalism, we combine cross-domain knowledge that enables the generation of whitelisting rules not only for statically defined protocol fields but also for communication flows and technical operation boundaries. Finally, we evaluate our specification-based intrusion detection system against various attack scenarios and assess detection quality and performance. In particular, we investigate a data manipulation attack in a future-orientated use case of an IEC 60870-based SCADA system that controls distributed energy resources in the distribution grid. Our approach can detect severe data manipulation attacks with high accuracy in a timely and reliable manner.},

            Cyber-physical systems (CPS) offer great potential for the digital transformation of industrial value creation in the context of Industry 4.0. They unify and integrate several technological approaches, including big data analysis and artificial intelligence, enhancing real-time monitoring and control of manufacturing processes. An extensive knowledge base formed by various disciplines, including information systems, engineering, and computer science, already exists for CPS. However, this knowledge has not been holistically captured and structured to date. To address this research gap, this study conducts a large-scale literature review of 2365 papers representing the current state of the research and then develops a novel categorization on industrial CPS with 10 sections, 32 areas, and 246 fields. The categorization is presented in hierarchical graphical form and can also be utilized as a web tool. To conclude, a perspective on future research needs and potentials to enhance Industry 4.0 in both research and practice are offered.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Emerging smart manufacturing technologies combine physical production networks with digital IT systems, resulting in complex smart factory networks, which are especially vulnerable to IT security risks, such as IT component non-availabilities. Companies must employ extensive IT security measures to secure their production facilities. However, complex network structures and inherent dependencies of smart factory networks complicate corresponding investment decisions and increase the need for appropriate decision support. We develop a risk assessment model that supports companies in the investment decision-making process regarding IT security measures by identifying and evaluating the most critical areas of the information network while considering the underlying production network. For this purpose, IT availability risks are quantified by means of graph theory, matrix notation, and value-at-risk. Our model provides a structured approach and considers network structures and interdependencies. The insights gained by our model present a profound economic basis for investment decisions on IT security measures. By applying our model in an exemplary real-world setting, we analyze various IT security measures and their risk reduction effect.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The literature on the modeling and management of data generated through the lifecycle of a manufacturing system is split into two main paradigms: product lifecycle management (PLM) and product, process, resource (PPR) modeling. These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.},

            Currently, Digital Twins receive considerable attention from practitioners and in research. A Digital Twin describes a concept that connects physical and virtual objects through a data linkage. However, Digital Twins are highly dependent on their individual use case, which leads to a plethora of Digital Twin configurations. Based on a thorough literature analysis and two interview series with experts from various electrical and mechanical engineering companies, this paper proposes a set of archetypes of Digital Twins for individual use cases. It delimits the Digital Twins from related concepts, e.g., Digital Threads. The paper delivers profound insights into the domain of Digital Twins and, thus, helps the reader to identify the different archetypical patterns.},

            The development of digital transformation in the construction industry has led to the increasing adoption of smart contracts. As programmable applications to automatically write, verify, and enforce transaction conditions, smart contracts can be used in different areas mainly to improve automation level, information security, and built digital environment enhancement. However, the smart contract is commonly mentioned as a blockchain appendage, while its unique connotation and value in the construction industry have not been recognized. Therefore, this study carries out a systematic review based on 81 research articles published from 2014 to 2021 on smart contract applications in construction to explore and highlight their potentials under domain-specific requirements. Results are analyzed according to research type categorization and domain codification. Eight research domains are identified, where the three most highly explored domains are contract and payment, supply chain and logistics, and information management. The integration of smart contracts with other innovative concepts and advanced technologies is analyzed. The applicability, benefits, and challenges of smart contract applications regarding different research domains are discussed.},

            In recent years, driven by Industry 4.0 wave, academic research has focused on the science, engineering, and enabling technologies for intelligent and cyber manufacturing. Using a network science and data mining-based Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN) methodology, this work analyzes the trends in data science topics in the manufacturing literature over the past two decades to inform the researchers, educators, industry leaders of knowledge trends in intelligent manufacturing. It studies the evolution of research topics and methods in data science, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and cyber manufacturing. The KCN methodology is applied to systematically analyze the keywords collected from 84,041 papers published in top-tier manufacturing journals between 2000 and 2020. It is not practically feasible to review this large body of literature through tradition manual approaches like systematic review and scoping review to discover insights. The results of network modeling and data analysis reveal important knowledge components and structure of the intelligent and cyber manufacturing literature, implicit the research interests switch and provide the insights for industry development. This paper maps the high frequency keywords in the recent literature to nine pillars of Industry 4.0 to help manufacturing community identify research and education directions for emerging technologies in intelligent manufacturing.},

              Cyber-physical systems are hybrid networked cyber and engineered physical elements that record data (e.g. using sensors), analyse them using connected services, influence physical processes and interact with human actors using multi-channel interfaces. Examples of CPS interacting with humans in industrial production environments are the so-called cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), where operators supervise the industrial machines, according to the human-in-the-loop paradigm. In this scenario, research challenges for implementing CPPS resilience, promptly reacting to faults, concern: (i) the complex structure of CPPS, which cannot be addressed as a monolithic system, but as a dynamic ecosystem of single CPS interacting and influencing each other; (ii) the volume, velocity and variety of data (Big Data) on which resilience is based, which call for novel methods and techniques to ensure recovery procedures; (iii) the involvement of human factors in these systems. In this paper, we address the design of resilient cyber-physical production systems (R-CPPS) in digital factories by facing these challenges. Specifically, each component of the R-CPPS is modelled as a
              smart machine
              , that is, a cyber-physical system equipped with a set of recovery services, a Sensor Data API used to collect sensor data acquired from the physical side for monitoring the component behaviour, and an operator interface for displaying detected anomalous conditions and notifying necessary recovery actions to on-field operators. A
              context-based mediator
              , at shop floor level, is in charge of ensuring resilience by gathering data from the CPPS, selecting the proper recovery actions and invoking corresponding recovery services on the target CPS. Finally,
              data summarisation and relevance evaluation
              techniques are used for supporting the identification of anomalous conditions in the presence of high volume and velocity of data collected through the Sensor Data API. The approach is validated in a food industry real case study.},

            Industrial collaborative robotics is promising for manufacturing activities where the presence of a robot alongside a human operator can improve operator’s working conditions, flexibility, and productivity. A collaborative robotic application has to guarantee not only safety of the human operator, but also fluency in the collaboration, as well as performance in terms of productivity and task time. In this paper, we present an approach to enhance fluency and productivity in human-robot collaboration through online scaling of dynamic safety zones. A supervisory controller runs online safety checks between bounding volumes enclosing robot and human to identify possible collision dangers. To optimize the sizes of safety zones enclosing the manipulator, the method minimizes the time of potential stop trajectories considering the robot dynamics and its torque constraints, and leverages the directed speed of the robot parts with respect to the human. Simulations and experimental tests on a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic arm verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and collaborative fluency metrics show the benefits of the method with respect to existing approaches.},

            Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), including monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis, and health management, occupies an increasingly important position in reducing costly breakdowns and avoiding catastrophic accidents in modern industry. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL) approaches, the application of AI-enabled methods to monitor, diagnose and predict potential equipment malfunctions has gone through tremendous progress with verified success in both academia and industry. However, there is still a gap to cover monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis based on AI-enabled methods, simultaneously, and the importance of an open source community, including open source datasets and codes, has not been fully emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper provides a systematic overview of the current development, common technologies, open source datasets, codes, and challenges of AI-enabled PHM methods from three aspects of monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This chapter presents a Digital Twin Pipeline Framework of the COGNITWIN project that supports Hybrid and Cognitive Digital Twins, through four Big Data and AI pipeline steps adapted for Digital Twins. The pipeline steps are Data Acquisition, Data Representation, AI/Machine learning, and Visualisation and Control. Big Data and AI Technology selections of the Digital Twin system are related to the different technology areas in the BDV Reference Model. A Hybrid Digital Twin is defined as a combination of a data-driven Digital Twin with First-order Physical models. The chapter illustrates the use of a Hybrid Digital Twin approach by describing an application example of Spiral Welded Steel Industrial Machinery maintenance, with a focus on the Digital Twin support for Predictive Maintenance. A further extension is in progress to support Cognitive Digital Twins includes support for learning, understanding, and planning, including the use of domain and human knowledge. By using digital, hybrid, and cognitive twins, the project’s presented pilot aims to reduce energy consumption and average duration of machine downtimes. Data-driven artificial intelligence methods and predictive analytics models that are deployed in the Digital Twin pipeline have been detailed with a focus on decreasing the machinery’s unplanned downtime. We conclude that the presented pipeline can be used for similar cases in the process industry.},

            In the last few years, the potential impact of big data on the manufacturing industry has received enormous attention. This chapter details two large-scale trials that have been implemented in the context of the lighthouse project Boost 4.0. The chapter introduces the Boost 4.0 Reference Model, which adapts the more generic BDVA big data reference architectures to the needs of Industry 4.0. The Boost 4.0 reference model includes a reference architecture for the design and implementation of advanced big data pipelines and the digital factory service development reference architecture. The engineering and management of business network track and trace processes in high-end textile supply are explored with a focus on the assurance of Preferential Certification of Origin (PCO). Finally, the main findings from these two large-scale piloting activities in the area of service engineering are discussed.},

            There is a consensus that health is a fundamental human right. The extent of the countries seeking to improve the health conditions of their people is one of the indications of sustainable development. Poor health systems jeopardise a country’s citizens’ rights, hinder their involvement in educational programs, limit their ability to participate in economic activities and engage in meaningful work fully and ultimately raise poverty regardless of gender. This chapter presents the business models of 55 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-3, Good Health and Well-Being. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            The current digital transformation of many businesses and the exponential growth of digital data are two of the key factors of digital revolution. For the successful meeting of high expectations, the data platforms need to employ the recent theoretical, technological, and methodological advances in contemporary computing and data science and engineering. This chapter presents an approach to address these challenges by combining logical methods for knowledge processing and machine learning methods for data analysis into a hybrid AI-based framework. It is applicable to a wide range of problems that involve both synchronous operations and asynchronous events in different domains. The framework is a foundation for building the GATE Data Platform, which aims at the application of Big Data technologies in civil and government services, industry, and healthcare. The platform implementation will utilize several recent distributed technologies such as Internet of Things, cloud, and edge computing and will integrate them into a multilevel service-oriented architecture that supports services along the entire data value chain, while the service orchestration guarantees a high degree of interoperability, reusability, and automation. The platform is designed to be compliant with the open-source software, but its open architecture supports also mixing with commercial components and tools.},

              The energy industry in Norway has a long tradition in using information technology to enable integrated operations, namely, remote collaboration between personnel at offshore installations and experts at onshore office environments. Currently, the industry is undergoing a digital transformation in which remote operations of unmanned offshore assets are the emerging standard. To ensure trustworthy and reliable operations, offshore remote sensing capabilities must be established through not only technical means but also a broader transformation involving new competence, work processes, and governance principles. In this chapter, we reconstruct this transformation and ask:
              What are the emerging capabilities that develop around the remote operation digital infrastructure?
              We unpack how the new digital infrastructure is a continuation of the practices and systems that have been established over time. We use historical reconstruction with vignettes from the development of a new generation of remotely operated offshore installations in oil and gas and wind facilities to describe the ongoing digital transformation as a process of infrastructuring in which the infrastructure gets increasingly entangled with internal and external systems, stakeholders, and agendas. In doing so, we shed light on how the established local and situated solutions evolve and are compensated for through the technical and organizational principles of the emerging information infrastructure.},

            Reaching affordable, clean, sustainable, modern and reliable energy is the main aim of the Sustainable Development Goal 7. Energy is placed at the centre of environmental and economic issues. Despite this significance, 20\% of people living worldwide cannot access electricity in 2021. Adaptation towards SDG-7, Affordable and Clean Energy, brings in new investments and creates a significant economy around it. While private investments and government spending in developed countries concentrate on achieving efficiency and renewable energy production, developing countries focus on obtaining access to electricity and clean energy sources. This chapter presents the business models of 60 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-7. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This chapter describes how smart applications from multiple domains can participate in the creation of data spaces based on FIWARE software building blocks. Smart applications participating in such data spaces share digital twin data in real time using a common standard API like NGSI-LD and relying on standard data models. Each smart solution contributes to build a complete digital twin data representation of the real world sharing their data. At the same time, they can exploit data shared by other applications. Relying on FIWARE Data Marketplace components, smart applications can publish data under concrete terms and conditions which include pricing or data usage/access policies.
            A federated cloud infrastructure and mechanisms supporting data sovereignty are necessary to create data spaces. However, additional elements have to be added to ease the creation of data value chains and the materialization of a data economy. Standard APIs, combined with standard data models, are crucial to support effective data exchange enabling loose coupling between parties as well as reusability and replaceability of data resources and applications. Similarly, data spaces need to incorporate mechanisms for publication, discovery, and trading of data resources. These are elements that FIWARE implements, and they can be combined with IDSA architecture elements like the IDS Connector to create data spaces supporting trusted and effective data sharing.
            The GAIA-X project, started in 2020, is aimed at creating a federated form of data infrastructure in Europe which strengthens the ability to both access and share data securely and confidently. FIWARE is bringing mature technologies, compatible with IDS and CEF Building Blocks, which will accelerate the delivery of GAIA-X to the market.},

            Previous energy transformations have been driven by the exploitation of a new energy resource. In contrast, although the digitalization of energy is delivering cost reductions in the supply and transportation of energy; digitalization is truly transformational because it brings the demand side into play, facilitating the move to a more integrated, highly flexible and customer-centric energy system which will ultimately unlock deep decarbonization of our societies. This fertile new energy landscape will be dominated by data-rich organizations able to establish direct relationships with consumers, resulting in the provision of new services which enable the integration of energy consumption with weather-dependent renewable production. Much of the focus is on the intelligent management of demand and supply from connected buildings and electric vehicles, leading to a proliferation of new business models. This increased connectivity comes with risks: increased danger of cybersecurity attacks and disruption of existing business relationships, staffing and organizational structures and a re-positioning of the role of the customer at the heart of the system. This commercial disruption is inherent to the digital transformation of the energy sector: an essential step in the transition to a carbon-neutral global economy.},

            In a digitalized and deeply interconnected industrial ecosystem, it is of paramount importance to create mechanisms that seamlessly guarantee standardization and verifiability, interoperability (including regional legislation), transparency, and trustworthiness, in particular in the intermediation of all businesses and stakeholders, including SMEs. In this respect, the International Data Spaces and GAIA-X initiatives pave the way to a framework for collaboration that use secure and trusted data services to safeguard digital sovereignty.
            Huawei is a leading ICT provider, operating in more than 170 countries, and an active member of more than 600 standardization bodies and industry associations, among them IDS and GAIA-X. With their international footprint, IDS and GAIA-X are of the utmost importance for Huawei in Germany, Europe, and globally. Here, we provide a brief overview of our understanding of the data ecosystem’s inherent issues, and how regulations address them, followed by more specific examples of how IDS and GAIA-X objectives can be supported by Huawei, with emphasis on validating concepts in the manufacturing domain as a prominent reference example for an important European market vertical. We illustrate the use case of an evolved implementation of Industry 4.0 that integrates machines and cloud services. 5G connectivity for trusted networked production is added to the example. We finally highlight the use of GAIA-X compliant federated AI for control, maintenance, and match-making of demand and supply actors.},

            Poverty, which has taken shape in different dimensions under the influence of the conditions from the past to the present, can be defined as the deficiency experienced by people in fulfilling their life functions or the living standards being below the average level. This chapter presents the business models of 39 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-1, No Poverty. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            Urban Internet of Things (IoT) is in an early speculative phase. Often linked to the smart city movement, it provides a way of sensing and collecting data—environmental, societal, and transitional—both automatically, remotely, and with increasing levels of spatial and temporal detail. From city-wide data collection down to the scale of individual buildings and rooms, this chapter details the technology behind the rise of IoT in urban areas and explores the challenges (societal and technical) behind city-wide deployments. Drawing from a series of deployments at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, it details the challenges and opportunities for mass data collection. Widening out the view, it looks at what is becoming known as “the humble lamp post” in Urban IoT fields to detail the potential of Urban IoT with the objects that already form part of the urban fabric. Finally, it examines the potential of Urban IoT for input into urban modeling and how we are on the edge of a shift in the collection, analysis, and communication of urban data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With increasing automation of manufacturing processes (focusing on technologies  such as robotics and human-robot interaction), there is a realisation that the manufacturing process and the artefacts/products it produces can be better connected post-production. Built on this requirement, a “chatty" factory involves creating products which are able to send data back to the manufacturing/production environment as they are used, whilst still ensuring user privacy. The intended use of a product during design phase may different significantly from actual usage. Understanding how this data can be used to support continuous product refinement, and how the manufacturing process can be dynamically adapted based on the availability of this data provides a number of opportunities. We describe how data collected on product use can be used to: (i) classify product use; (ii) associate a label with product use using unsupervised learning—making use of edge-based analytics; (iii) transmission of this data to a cloud environment where labels can be compared across different products of the same type. Federated learning strategies are used on edge devices to ensure that any data captured from a product can be analysed locally (ensuring data privacy).},

            Nations and cities are eagerly joining the global trend of transition to digitized society. Through digitalization, societies aim to streamline their key functions and to develop modern services to inhabitants. 5G wireless networks are being built globally with lots of expectations put on them. It is anticipated that at the first phase of 5G, the technology will benefit the most different verticals like factories, hospitals and campuses. Universities have likewise awoken to establish digitalization projects to respond to the disruption of education and to overcome in the growing global competition. The transition to digital campus will inevitably rely on campus ICT and IoT infrastructures. Additionally, the number of terminals, devices, sensors and robots will multiply. This article proposes a technical architecture for future Smart Campus consisting of 5G and IoT networks complemented by distributed computing and data analytics. Increasing complexity of digital environment calls for a specific actor to operate the Smart Campus infrastructure and also services, which has not been widely discussed. It is foreseen that the university IT Administration is probably not willing to adopt the responsibility of enlarging infra and growing number of devices. Similarly, mobile network operators are not seen appropriate to take this role being commonly profiled to offer merely connectivity. To tackle this question, a novel operational model for the Smart Campuses is presented based on the recently proposed micro operator concept. Moreover, a case study of the University of Oulu campus is presented, where smart technology in the form of 5G test network has been deployed.},

              Sustainability has entered all aspects of life, calling for an active approach from the wireless and mobile communications community to help in solving fundamental challenges facing societies. Societal, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainability have become increasingly important design criteria in developing future technologies, along with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework that sets specific goals and targets to be achieved by 2030. The role of mobile communications is important in supporting nations and organizations in meeting the UN SDGs in a timely manner, but the whole ICT sector itself, with its critical role as the backbone of society, can create a significant sustainability burden. Research on the next-generation mobile communication networks (6G) has started, aiming at first deployments in 2030, in a new era where sustainability defines its development. Therefore, sustainability, especially through the UN SDGs, and the future 6G wireless networks, cannot be treated in isolation, but a clear connection between them is urgently needed. This paper extends from traditional green communications and energy efficiency considerations in wireless communications to establishing a close connection between 6G and the triple bottom line of
              economic
              sustainability,
              societal
              sustainability, and
              environmental
              sustainability. The paper outlines open research challenges for sustainable 6G development and provides a set of research questions encouraging especially the researchers and engineers in the wireless and mobile communications community to address to realize a sustainable future.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Industrial revolutions (IRs) are mostly associated with how transformations regarding the operations of an enterprise affect said enterprise’s manufacturing systems. However, the impact of these transformations exceeds the production systems themselves; rather, they affect the entire value chain, from the product design and development process (PDDP) through manufacturing and supply-chain management to marketing and disposal. As the new PDDP to a large extent defines the value chain for a company, the challenge lies in ensuring that the designed product will help the company fully benefit from the IRs. By analysing the 4th IR, the authors reveal that few publications shed light on this aspect. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to establish features and properties that will shape the PDDP throughout the 4th IR and into a smart design engineering. To accomplish this, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature, which provides ten findings. These findings are then analysed by 11 specialists both from academia and the industry, and the findings’ relations to the 4th IR and their impact on the product development process is discussed. By establishing these findings, this paper provides a platform for the understanding of what could potentially shape smart design engineering and its design-related activities.},

            Distribution networks are evolving to become more responsive with increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and digital transformation at the grid edges. This evolution imposes many challenges to the operation of the network, which then calls for new control and operation paradigms. Among others, a so-called grid-edge control is emerging to harmonise the coexistence of the grid control system and DER’s autonomous control. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the grid-edge control with various control architectures, layers, and strategies. The challenges and opportunities for such an approach at the grid edge with the integration of DERs and digital transformation are summarised. The potential solutions to support the network operation by using the inherent controllability of DER and the availability of the digital transformation at the grid edges are discussed.},

            In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings’ performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings’ management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings’ performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.},

            The fourth industrial revolution is shaping a new industrial landscape. A variety of technologies related to software, information and communication technologies embody a ubiquitous digital and connectivity era. These technologies enable the creation of new products with the integration of connectivity, data collection and processing capacities which require combining engineering disciplines. Increasing product multidisciplinarity compels companies to adapt their product development practices. The scientific literature offers a variety of concepts and techniques to support multidisciplinary product development. This paper seeks to organize the landscape of concepts and techniques available for multidisciplinary product development. An extensive literature review was conducted, and 236 concepts and techniques were identified. Multidisciplinary products of interest deal with both software and hardware development and can be encountered through the denominations of cyber-physical systems, mechatronics and smart products and systems. An in-depth analysis led to the classification and mapping, for each product denomination, of the concepts and techniques available to support their development. The classification relies on a four-level model paired with a decision tree to thoroughly sort the variety of concepts and techniques into the approach, process, method, and tool levels. The mapping between the sorted concepts and techniques enabled the generation of graphical representations called cartographies. These cartographies serve to support companies’ transformation towards the fourth industrial revolution from the product development perspective by giving a general overview of the related literature, and guiding them in the identification of the most suitable approaches, processes, methods and tools.},

            The Internet of Things technology offers convenience and innovation in areas such as smart homes and smart cities. Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12\% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms. We propose an IoT Cybersecurity Communication Scorecard to help organizations benchmark the density and sentiment of their corporate communications regarding security against their specific industry.},

            Digital transformation (DT) has become a buzzword, triggering different disciplines in research and influencing practice, which leads to independent research streams. Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.},

We review the literature on cloud computing and related concepts and propose a definition of the cloud economy. Based on this new definition, we create a China Cloud Economy Index (CCEI) and its sub-indices. Using stock market data from 2012 to 2020, we analyze the basic characteristics of these indices, their validity, and their relationship with the overall stock market. The robustness of the new index is also examined. We find that the relationship between the CCEI and the stock market had been getting stronger but weakened somewhat after January 11, 2019 plausibly because of the availability of recent cloud-related policies that have widened the gap between the market performance of CCEI and that of the stock market.},

            Innovation plays a critical role in the mining industry as a tool to improve the efficiency of its processes, to reduce costs, but also to meet the increasing social and environmental concerns among communities and authorities. Technological progress has also been crucial to allow the exploitation of new deposits in more complex scenarios: lower ore grades, extreme weather conditions, deeper deposits, harder rock mass, and high-stress environments. This paper discusses the importance of innovation for the mining industry and describes the mechanisms by which it is carried out. It includes a review of the drivers and actors involved and current trends. The digital transformation process that the industry is going through is analyzed, along with other relevant trends that are likely to shape the mining of the future. Additionally, a case study is presented to illustrate the technical and economic implications of developing a disruptive innovation project.},

            Today’s supply chain is becoming complex and fragile. Hence, supply chain managers need to create and unlock the value of the smart supply chain. A smart supply chain requires connectivity, visibility, and agility, and it needs be integrated and intelligent. The digital twin (DT) concept satisfies these requirements. Therefore, we propose creating a DT-driven supply chain (DTSC) as an innovative and integrated solution for the smart supply chain. We provide background information to explain the DT concept and to demonstrate the method for building a DTSC by using the DT concept. We discuss three research opportunities in building a DTSC, including supply chain modeling, real-time supply chain optimization, and data usage in supply chain collaboration. Finally, we highlight a motivating case from JD.COM, China’s largest retailer by revenue, in applying the DTSC platform to address supply chain network reconfiguration challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

            The COVID-19 pandemic before mass vaccination can be restrained only by the limitation of contacts between people, which makes the digital economy a key condition for survival. More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and many cities have already transformed into “smart” digital/virtual hubs. Digital services ensure city life safe without an economy lockout and unemployment. Urban society strives to be safe, sustainable, well-being, and healthy. We set the task to construct a hybrid sociological and technological concept of a smart city with matched solutions, complementary to each other. Our modeling with the elaborated digital architectures and with the bionic solution for ensuring sufficient data governance showed that a smart city in comparison with the traditional city is tightly interconnected inside like a social “organism”. Society has entered a decisive decade during which the world will change by moving closer towards SDGs targets 2030 as well as by the transformation of cities and their digital infrastructures. It is important to recognize the large vector of sociological transformation as smart cities are just a transition phase to human-centered personal space or smart home. The “atomization” of the world urban population raises the gap problem in achieving SDGs because of different approaches to constructing digital architectures for smart cities or smart homes in countries. The strategy of creating smart cities should bring each citizen closer to SDGs at the individual level, laying in the personal space the principles of sustainable development and wellness of personality.},

            In order to ensure the safety and security of industrial systems with regard to all life cycle phases from development through operation to disposal, specific regulatory and normative requirements are imposed. Due to the digitalization, interconnection, and constantly increasing complexity of manufacturing systems in the context of Industrie 4.0, the manual effort necessary to achieve the required safety and security is becoming ever greater and almost impossible to manage, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, this paper examines the existing challenges in this area in more detail and gives an outlook on the possible solutions to ensure safety and security much quicker and with less manual effort. The overall vision is a (partially) automated risk assessment of modular systems with respect to safety and security, including the alignment of the corresponding processes from both domains and the formalization of the information models needed.

            Zusammenfassung
            Um Safety und Security von industriellen Systemen im Hinblick auf alle Lebenszyklusphasen von der Entwicklung über den Betrieb bis zur Entsorgung zu gewährleisten, werden bestimmte regulatorische und normative Anforderungen gestellt. Durch die Digitalisierung, Vernetzung und stetig steigende Komplexität von Fertigungssystemen im Kontext von Industrie 4.0 wird der manuelle Aufwand zur Sicherstellung der geforderten Safety und Security immer größer und vor allem für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen kaum noch bewältigbar. Daher untersucht dieser Artikel die bestehenden Probleme in diesem Bereich genauer und gibt einen Ausblick auf die möglichen Lösungen, um Safety und Security deutlich schneller und mit weniger manuellem Aufwand zu gewährleisten. Ziel ist eine (teil-) automatisierte Risikobeurteilung von modularen Systemen in Bezug auf Safety und Security, einschließlich des Abgleichs der entsprechenden Prozesse aus beiden Domänen und der Formalisierung der benötigten Informationsmodelle.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This article describes the impact of the global digital economy on the technological development of the mineral sector in the world. Due to the different specifics of the legislative bases of the investigated regions, such as the USA, China, EU, and Africa, the development of digital transformation is presented on the example of the Russian Federation in the context of world trends. The article presents an analysis of the possibilities of using straight-through digital technology in prospecting, design, development, and use of mineral resources. It describes a structure promoting the development of applied digital technology through research–education centers and international competence centers. This structure would allow forming the new competencies for personnel working in the digital economy. The underfunding of the information and computing infrastructure could be a significant challenge to the digital transformation of the economy. Creating the conditions for a reliable and secure process of generating, storing, and using data is the basis for protection from the cybersecurity hazard that could act as a brake on technology advancement. This article discusses the organizational and technological priorities of the development of the mineral resource sector on the example of the Russian Federation. The challenges for the mineral resource complex resulting from global changes can be taken on through technological changes of the industry. The article gives a thorough description of issues related to technological developments in the raw materials sector, oil refining industry, development of integrated and advanced mineral processing systems, and the use of household and industrial wastes. The research presents basic technology contributing to sustainable development, starting from exploration and production forecasting and up to sustainable planning and distribution of material and energy resources based on real-time data. It also pays special attention to the possibilities of creating digital platforms for the mineral sector. Digital integration, combining research areas, personnel, processes, users, and data will create conditions for scientific and technological achievements and breakthroughs, providing scientific and economic developments in related industries and, above all, in the global mineral and raw materials market.},

            In recent times, the literature has seen considerable growth in research at the intersection of digital innovation, data analytics, and supply chain resilience. While the number of studies on the topic has been burgeoning, due to the absence of a comprehensive literature review, it remains unclear what aspects of the subject have already been investigated and what are the avenues for impactful future research. Integrating bibliometric analysis with a systematic review approach, this paper offers the review of 262 articles at the nexus of innovative technologies, data analytics, and supply chain resiliency. The analysis uncovers the critical research clusters, the evolution of research over time, knowledge trajectories and methodological development in the area. Our thorough analysis enriches contemporary knowledge on the subject by consolidating the dispersed literature on the significance of innovative technologies, data analytics and supply chain resilience thereby recognizing major research clusters or domains and fruitful paths for future research. The review also helps improve practitioners’ awareness of the recent research on the topic by recapping key findings of a large amount of literature in one place.},

            Smart grids (SG) draw the attention of cyber attackers due to their vulnerabilities, which are caused by the usage of heterogeneous communication technologies and their distributed nature. While preventing or detecting cyber attacks is a well-studied field of research, making SG more resilient against such threats is a challenging task. This paper provides a classification of the proposed cyber resilience methods against cyber attacks for SG. This classification includes a set of studies that propose cyber-resilient approaches to protect SG and related cyber-physical systems against unforeseen anomalies or deliberate attacks. Each study is briefly analyzed and is associated with the proper cyber resilience technique which is given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Special Publication 800-160. These techniques are also linked to the different states of the typical resilience curve. Consequently, this paper highlights the most critical challenges for achieving cyber resilience, reveals significant cyber resilience aspects that have not been sufficiently considered yet and, finally, proposes scientific areas that should be further researched in order to enhance the cyber resilience of SG.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Complex processes meet and need Industry 4.0 capabilities. Shorter product cycles, flexible production needs, and direct assessment of product quality attributes and raw material attributes call for an increased need of new process analytical technologies (PAT) concepts. While individual PAT tools may be available since decades, we need holistic concepts to fulfill above industrial needs. In this series of two contributions, we want to present a combined view on the future of PAT (process analytical technology), which is projected in smart labs (Part 1) and smart sensors (Part 2). Part 2 of this feature article series describes the future functionality as well as the ingredients of a smart sensor aiming to eventually fuel full PAT functionality. The smart sensor consists of (i) chemical and process information in the physical twin by smart field devices, by measuring multiple components, and is fully connected in the IIoT 4.0 environment. In addition, (ii) it includes process intelligence in the digital twin, as to being able to generate knowledge from multi-sensor and multi-dimensional data. The cyber-physical system (CPS) combines both elements mentioned above and allows the smart sensor to be self-calibrating and self-optimizing. It maintains its operation autonomously. Furthermore, it allows—as central PAT enabler—a flexible but also target-oriented predictive control strategy and efficient process development and can compensate variations of the process and raw material attributes. Future cyber-physical production systems—like smart sensors—consist of the fusion of two main pillars, the physical and the digital twins. We discuss the individual elements of both pillars, such as connectivity, and chemical analytics on the one hand as well as hybrid models and knowledge workflows on the other. Finally, we discuss its integration needs in a CPS in order to allow its versatile deployment in efficient process development and advanced optimum predictive process control.},

            Nowadays, the market competition becomes increasingly fierce due to diversified customer needs, stringent environmental requirements, and global competitors. One of the most important factors for companies to not only survive but also thrive in today’s competitive market is their logistics performance. This paper aims, through a systematic literature analysis of 115 papers from 2012 to 2020, at presenting quantitative insights and comprehensive overviews of the current and future research landscapes of sustainable logistics in the Industry 4.0 era. The results show that Industry 4.0 technologies provide opportunities for improving the economic efficiency, environmental performance, and social impact of logistics sectors. However, several challenges arise with this technological transformation, i.e., trade-offs among different sustainability indicators, unclear benefits, lifecycle environmental impact, inequity issues, and technology maturity. Thus, to better tackle the current research gaps, future suggestions are given to focus on the balance among different sustainability indicators through the entire lifecycle, human-centric technological transformation, system integration and digital twin, semi-autonomous transportation solutions, smart reverse logistics, and so forth.},

            The study of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a continuous endeavor of scientists and engineers for over 65 years. The simple contention is that human-created machines can do more than just labor-intensive work; they can develop human-like intelligence. Being aware or not, AI has penetrated into our daily lives, playing novel roles in industry, healthcare, transportation, education, and many more areas that are close to the general public. AI is believed to be one of the major drives to change socio-economical lives. In another aspect, AI contributes to the advancement of state-of-the-art technologies in many fields of study, as helpful tools for groundbreaking research. However, the prosperity of AI as we witness today was not established smoothly. During the past decades, AI has struggled through historical stages with several winters. Therefore, at this juncture, to enlighten future development, it is time to discuss the past, present, and have an outlook on AI. In this article, we will discuss from a historical perspective how challenges were faced on the path of revolution of both the AI tools and the AI systems. Especially, in addition to the technical development of AI in the short to mid-term, thoughts and insights are also presented regarding the symbiotic relationship of AI and humans in the long run.},

            Digital Twins offer considerable potential for cross-company networks. Recent research primarily focuses on using Digital Twins within the limits of a single organization. However, Shared Digital Twins extend application boundaries to cross-company utilization through their ability to act as a hub to share data. This results in the need to consider additional design dimensions which help practitioners design Digital Twins tailored for inter-company use. The article addresses precisely that issue as it investigates how Shared Digital Twins should be designed to achieve business success. For this purpose, the article proposes a set of design principles for Shared Digital Twins stemming from a qualitative interview study with 18 industry experts. The interview study is the primary data source for formulating and evaluating the design principles.},

              Maintaining pace with ongoing changes due to digitalization is challenging for manufacturing companies. For successful implementation of digitalization, manufacturing companies must consider their existing technical systems, organizational structures, and processes, as well as social aspects. With the support of a maturity model, a company-specific digitalization level can be evaluated to provide manufacturing companies with an initial insight into their particular status quo; this can serve as a starting point for future optimization and digitalization projects. Furthermore, the results of such an analysis allow objective comparison of different areas within the company and with competitors. In this paper, the “Integrierte Arbeitssystemgestaltung in digitalisierten Produktionsunternehmen” (InAsPro) maturity model is presented, which considers the
              Development
              ,
              Production
              , and

              product lifecycle phases, as well as
              Aftersales
              , and assesses their digitalization level focusing on the four dimensions of
              Technology
              ,
              Organization
              ,

              , and
              Corporate Strategy
              . The maturity model’s rating scale distinguishes between four maturity levels. The results given by the InAsPro maturity model for an entire company are presented, along with those for each product lifecycle phase.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The global industrial mining sector is, like other sectors, undergoing an unprecedented transformation pushed by global sustainability and climate challenges. The need to increase productivity and efficiency of mineral extraction along with increasing pressure from a wide range of stakeholders to decarbonise the industry and make mining practices more sustainable, accountable, and socially acceptable are driving the adoption of automation and digitalisation technologies as well as the electrification of equipment and the implementation of more sustainable energy solutions for the industry. Automation and digitalisation are changing the way minerals and metals are extracted and provide important tools for designing and implementing the mine of the future: a digitally integrated, autonomous mine where no humans need to be put in harm’s way and in which the connected systems are able to reduce the ever-increasing complexity to such an extent that improved decision-making can be realised in real time. Mining as an industry still has a way to go to reach the potential of automation and digitalisation on the one hand, and alternative drive systems and sustainable power generation on the other. This paper will give an overview of empirically derived leading technologies underlying the current transformation and will place them in the context of the data-information-value-chain that can provide a more systematic approach to describe the various technologies and, in particular, their interrelationships. This can support a better understanding of assessing the overall technological maturity of an operation, especially with respect to their evolution from automation of equipment towards autonomous systems. There is no reason to doubt that, from a technology perspective, the digitally connected, autonomous, and carbon-free mine have the potential to become a reality. Breakthrough effects can be expected to come not from any single technology but rather from successfully developing, implementing, and integrating the full suite of (available) automation and digitalisation technologies across entire mining operations and moving towards digitally integrated, autonomous systems considering the process and its interrelations holistically (Clausen et al. 2020b). However, in order to get there, mining companies need to consider not only the technological aspects of this transformation. For successfully responding to the changing landscape of stakeholder expectations and future-proofing the industry requires, the authors argue that mining companies need to adopt a mind-set of the human-centred climate smart mine (Clausen and Sörensen 2021). In addition, mining companies need to reconsider their role in the economic, social, and environmental ecosystem they are embedded in so they can break through traditions that keep them from successfully positioning themselves as builders of social value.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            To assure certain critical quality properties (e.g., safety, security, or privacy), supervisory authorities and industrial associations provide reference frameworks such as standards or guidelines that in some cases are enforced (e.g., regulations). Given the pace at which both technical advancements and risks appear, there is an increase in the number of reference frameworks. As several frameworks might apply for same systems, certain overlaps appear (e.g., regulations for different countries where the system will operate, or generic standards in conjunction with more concrete standards for a given industrial sector or system type). We propose the use of modelling for alleviating the complexity of these reference frameworks ecosystems, and we provide a tool-supported method to create them for the benefit of different stakeholders. The case study is based on privacy data protection, and more concretely on privacy impact assessment processes. The European GDPR regulates the movement and processing of personal data, and, contrary to available software engineering privacy guidelines, articles in legal texts are usually difficult to translate to the underlying processes, artefacts and roles that they refer to. To facilitate the mutual comprehension of legal experts and engineers, in this work we investigate how mappings can be created between these two domains of expertise. Notably, we rely on modelling as a central point. We modelled the legal requirements of the GDPR on data protection impact assessments, and then, we selected the ISO/IEC 29134, a mainstream engineering guideline for privacy impact assessment, and, taking a concrete sector as example, the EU Smart Grid Data Protection Impact Assessment template. The OpenCert tool was used for providing technical support to both the modelling and the creation of the mapping models in a systematic way. We provide a qualitative evaluation from legal experts and privacy engineering practitioners to report on the benefits and limitations of this approach.},

            Digital transformation is continuously changing ecosystems, which also forces established companies to re-evaluate their value proposition. However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied. Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five ecosystems. Cluster 02–05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at least two ecosystems. Clusters 06–15 are ecosystem-specific that only include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.},

              Aim
              The purpose of this review is to examine the applications of novel digital technology domains for the screening and management of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR).
            
            
              Methods
              A PubMed engine search was performed, using the terms “Telemedicine”, “Digital health”, “Telehealth”, “Telescreening”, “Artificial intelligence”, “Deep learning”, “Smartphone”, “Triage”, “Screening”, “Home-based”, “Monitoring”, “Ophthalmology”, “Diabetes”, “Diabetic Retinopathy”, “Retinal imaging”. Full-text English language studies from January 1, 2010, to February 1, 2022, and reference lists were considered for the conceptual framework of this review.
            
            
              Results
              Diabetes mellitus and its eye complications, including DR, are particularly well suited to digital technologies, providing an ideal model for telehealth initiatives and real-world applications. The current development in the adoption of telemedicine, artificial intelligence and remote monitoring as an alternative to or in addition to traditional forms of care will be discussed.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Advances in digital health have created an ecosystem ripe for telemedicine in the field of DR to thrive. Stakeholders and policymakers should adopt a participatory approach to ensure sustained implementation of these technologies after the COVID-19 pandemic.

            This paper proposes a general approach for using conversational interfaces such as chatbots to offer adaptive learning of business processes in an environment involving different actors. Adaptivity concerns both the content being proposed, the sequence of learning items, and the way the conversation is conducted. The original approach allows the development of sustainable chatbots and empowers various non-technical actors (authors, teachers, publishers, and learners) to control the chatbot features directly. The aCHAT-WF framework (adaptive CHATbot for WorkFlows), proposed in this paper for managing conversational interfaces, conceptually represents all the aspects related to a conversation about business processes, with different facets for the user, the conversation flow, and the conversation contents, combining them to obtain a flexible interaction with the user. The paper focuses on the different preparation phases for instructional material based on Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models, separating the different roles involved in the construction of a chatbot for teaching business processes and with the possibility of defining different styles for the interaction with the users. The proposed method is configuration-driven, to facilitate the separation of the different aspects of the control of the interaction and the delivery of contents.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The emerging phenomenon of platformization has given rise to what has been termed "platform society,“ a digitally connected world where platforms have penetrated the heart of urban societies—transforming social practices, disrupting social interactions and market relations, and affecting democratic processes. One of the recent manifestations of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform whose data infrastructures, governance models, and economic processes are predicted to penetrate different urban sectors and spheres of urban life. The Metaverse is an idea of a hypothetical set of “parallel virtual worlds” that incarnate ways of living in believably virtual cities as an alternative to future data-driven smart cities. However, this idea has already raised concerns over what constitutes the global architecture of computer mediation underlying the Metaverse with regard to different forms of social life as well as social order. This study analyzes the core emerging trends enabling and driving data-driven smart cities and uses the outcome to devise a novel framework for the digital and computing processes underlying the Metaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities. Further, it examines and discusses the risks and impacts of the Metaverse, paying particular attention to: platformization; the COVID-19 crisis and the ensuing non-spontaneous "normality" of social order; corporate-led technocratic governance; governmentality; privacy, security, and trust; and data governance. A thematic analysis approach is adopted to cope with the vast body of literature of various disciplinarities. The analysis identifies five digital and computing processes related to data-driven smart cities: digital instrumentation, digital hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization. The novelty of the framework derived based on thematic analysis lies in its essential processual digital and computing components and the way in which these are structured and integrated given their clear synergies as to enabling the functioning of the Metaverse towards potentially virtual cities. This study highlights how and why the identified digital and computing processes—as intricately interwoven with the entirety of urban ways of living—arouse contentions and controversies pertaining to society’ public values. As such, it provides new insights into understanding the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form of science and technology and the other dimensions of society. Accordingly, it contributes to the scholarly debates in the field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) by highlighting the societal and ethical implications of the platformization of urban societies through the Metaverse.},

Based on literature and previously conducted research we present guidelines and a modular framework for implementing smart manufacturing in SMEs. In addition, a stage model is illustrated to support SMEs in breaking down the framework from a design level to an implementation and operational level. Finally, an outlook is given on the future challenges that SMEs will face in the coming years when they want to reach the next level of Industry 4.0 in their own company.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Industry 4.0 has started to transform the manufacturing industries by embracing digitalization, automation, and big data, aiming for interconnected systems, autonomous decisions, and smart factories. Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), have emerged as potent tools to address the related computational tasks. These advancements have also reached the pharmaceutical industry, where the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative has already paved the way for the real-time analysis of the processes and the science- and risk-based flexible production. This paper aims to assess the potential of ANNs within the PAT concept to aid the modernization of pharmaceutical manufacturing. The current state of ANNs is systematically reviewed for the most common manufacturing steps of solid pharmaceutical products, and possible research gaps and future directions are identified. In this way, this review could aid the further development of machine learning techniques for pharmaceutical production and eventually contribute to the implementation of intelligent manufacturing lines with automated quality assurance.

            The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) promises productivity gains in industrial practice. While IT technology offers a variety of technological advances, plant owners strive for stability and robustness of the production process. To overcome this tension field, we propose a set of 16 requirements for the development of industrial AI solutions to foster i) the adaptation process, ii) support the solution engineering and iii) ease the embedding into the existing system landscape while respecting iv) safety aspects to build up v) trust into industrial AI solutions. The proposed requirements can guide industrial stakeholders to focus on the right solution approach for specific production challenges and support them in voicing their own needs towards novel AI solutions. This will help AI developers to speed up time-to-market as well as to increase market acceptance of industrial AI solutions. Overall, specifying requirements on industrial AI will foster the acceptance and utilization rates of AI solutions in industrial practice.},

            This chapter presents a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for supply chain and it is the result of an intensive work jointly performed involving a wide network of stakeholders from discrete manufacturing, process industry and logistics sector to put forward a vision to strengthen European Supply Chains for the next decade. The work is based on matching visions from literature and from experts with several iterations between desk research and workshops, focus groups and interviews. The result is a detailed analysis of the supply chain strategies identified as most relevant for the next years and definition of the related research and innovation topics as future developments and steps for the full implementation of the strategies, thus proposing innovative and cutting-edge actions to be implemented based on technological development and organisational change.},

            Developing and underdeveloped countries need durable infrastructure investments, sustainable industrial breakthroughs and innovative approaches to achieve sustainable economic growth and social and grassroots development and combat climate change. SDG-9, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, is based on three main themes. To provide transportation, information and communication infrastructures, which are an important part of development in line with these goals, the key to sustainable economic growth and raising the welfare level of the society is to develop industrialisation, and new technological developments and new skills in line with innovation are discussed. This chapter presents the business models of 59 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-9. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            City governance is vital for sustainable development goals and resource management and allocation as well as urban climate-related initiatives, as it is estimated that more people will reside in the urban areas in further years. As more people migrate to cities, the world steadily becomes more urbanised. The population of the cities accounts for 55\% of the total population, and cities generate 85\% of global gross domestic product and emit 75\% of greenhouse gas emissions. SDG-11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, aims to ensure inclusive, safe, resilient, sustainable urban and human settlements by providing inexpensive transit solutions, decreasing urban sprawl, enhancing urban governance involvement, improving the protection of cultural assets and addressing urban resilience and climate change issues. This chapter presents the business models of 50 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-11. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            Economic growth can be defined by increasing consumption due to the increase in population and reaching production amounts to meet consumption with technological developments and governmental incentives. The correct placement of people in the production and consumption equation can be expressed as decent work. Although decent work and economic growth may seem like different terms at first glance, they are inseparable terms for each other. SDG-8, Decent Work and Economic Growth, aims to attain full and productive employment, as well as respectable work, for all women and men by 2030. This chapter presents the business models of 37 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-8. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            Emerging technologies can be defined as a set of technologies whose development and application areas are still expanding rapidly, and their technical and value potential is still largely unrealised. Naturally, this leads to a vivid innovation environment for these technologies. In this book, tech-savvy people can easily read and understand the working principles of 34 different emerging technologies. And then, they can see in what areas these technologies are used and how they can create value. Moreover, the book starts with an “Innovation Journey” chapter. This chapter focuses on innovation and how ideas are converted into value and business. By value, we mean monetary, environmental and social value. In addition, for entrepreneurs and start-ups, we also show the funding and financing mechanisms for innovative ideas.},
