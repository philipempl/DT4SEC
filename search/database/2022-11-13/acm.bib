abstract = {The advancements in the field of internet of things, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics has laid the path to the evolution of digital twin technology. The digital twin is a high-fidelity digital model of a physical system or asset that can be used e.g. to optimize operations and predict faults of the physical system. To understand different use cases of digital twin and its potential for cybersecurity incident prediction, we have performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). In this paper, we summarize the definition of digital twin and state-of-the-art on the development of digital twin including reported work on the usability of a digital twin for cybersecurity. Existing tools and technologies for developing digital twin is discussed.},

abstract = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a manin-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

abstract = {As drone technology passes one milestone after the other, drones are used in an ever-increasing number of applications and are now considered as an integral part of the future smart city infrastructure. At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.},

abstract = {Autonomy has been touted to be a major asset of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and its components. By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in the complex system related research works, where network connectivity enhances computing power and systemic behavior emerges through the competition, interaction, collaboration and integration among individual interweaving, which consists of real-time monitoring, data management, physical feedback control. From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical digital twin model framework for CPS design. In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle. Finally, an industrial robot application is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the model framework.},

abstract = {Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.},

The gap between simulation and reality limits the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in UAV path planning. Therefore, we propose a digital twin-based deep reinforcement learning training framework. With the help of digital twin, DRL model can be trained more effectively deployed to real UAVs. In this training framework, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based multi-UAV path planning algorithm. Based on decomposed actor structure in DRL, we design a pooling-based combined LSTM network to better understand different state information in a multi-UAV path planning task. Moreover, we also establish a digital twin platform for multi-UAV system, which has a high degree of simulation and visualization. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher mean rewards, and outperforms DDPG in average arrival rate by more than 30%.},

abstract = {In Korea, a strong earthquake of 5.8 and 5.4 magnitude occurred in Gyeongju in September 2016 and Pohang in November 2018 respectively. In the case of the Pohang Earthquake, the ground is losing its resistance and the ground liquefaction phenomenon that is behaving like a liquid is officially reported. In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.},

In this position paper, we elucidate unique characteristics and capabilities of a DT framework that enables realization of such promises as online learning of a physical environment, real-time monitoring of assets, Monte Carlo heuristic search for predictive prevention, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning in real-time. We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.},

abstract = {Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.},

In this paper, we investigated the possibilities of using synthetic datasets, generated from Virtual Environments (VE) for training and validation of CNN models. We present two use cases where the above-mentioned circumstances play a vital role in preparing the datasets and validating the model with large-scale datasets.

abstract = {Background: Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPSS) denote a service-oriented way of providing access to cyber-physical systems' (CPS) capabilities. The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences and downtime.},

For the Product entire life cycle, the use of different rules for encoding information between companies will hinder the sharing of the Digital twin model, which will subsequently increase the difficulty of constructing the Digital twin scene. This article proposes a combination of identity resolution and digital twin, which has broken the barriers to data flow between enterprises. Finally, to realize the model sharing between different enterprises. In the field of aviation manufacturing, the two are organically combined. Use the IIoT platform to establish a full-element, multi-scale product twin model. Apply it to the full life cycle management of Aviation products and target several important life stages of Aviation products. To study the method and application of the corresponding twin scene model to realize the intelligent manufacturing of Aviation products.},

abstract = {Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) communities are often asked to test devices regarding their effects on underlying infrastructure. Usually, only one or two devices are given to the testers, but hundreds or thousands are needed to really test IoT effects. This proposition makes IoT Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) cost and management prohibitive. One possible approach is to develop a digital twin of the IoT device and employ many replicas of the twin in a simulation environment comprised of various simulators that mimic the IoT device's operational environment. Cyber attack experimentation is a critical aspect of IoT T&amp;E and without such a virtual T&amp;E environment, it is almost impossible to study large scale effects. This paper will present a digital twin engineering methodology as applicable to IoT device T&amp;E and cyber experimentation.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {As the need for situational awareness rises in search and rescue tasks, systems for human spatial sensing augmentation in complex-built environments has become increasingly important. Sensor-based mapping and augmented reality (AR) techniques have been tested to provide enhanced visual assistance in indoor scenarios, such as "seeing through walls" abilities for occluded areas. Scholars have examined various scanning techniques and UI/UX designs for AR-based occlusion visualization. However, evidence is still needed to show how scene capturing, 3D mapping, rendering and visualization can be executed integratively, enabling an instantaneous "Digital Twins" modeling. This paper presents a robot-based system for mapping indoor environments and creating a near real-time virtual replica. A dynamically updated 3D map rendered with Unity generates egocentric "x-ray vision" views of the occluded objects using AR headsets. A case study was performed in a lab room, resulting in virtual regeneration of surroundings supporting search and rescue in occluded areas.},

abstract = {Ever since cyber attacks focused on industrial and critical infrastructure settings, the awareness of the security issues of these systems has increased. These industrial control systems (ICS) mainly focus on operation and availability -- instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the ICS to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel.},

abstract = {Coastal lagoons are ecosystems with significant environmental and socio-economic value. However, these natural systems are especially vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanization as a consequence of the tourist development. Despite the vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems, there has been limited development of novel techniques which can provide real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources. Beyond being useful for policy-making procedures at multiple levels of granularity, such tools can increase local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts. This paper introduces the key concept behind the SMARTLAGOON project, which intends to develop a digital twin to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Particularly, we focus on the main research activities carried out since the beginning of the project (January 1st, 2021), which are mainly based on initial mapping and reporting of the main stakeholders' needs and wishes in relation to the technological products to be developed in SMARTLAGOON. This will onset the initial development pathway, while additional stakeholder inputs during the project lifetime will help to further explore and prioritize the key developments, thus maximizing the relevance and impact of the Mar Menor's digital twin.},

Resolving these events is challenging due to extensive manual processes, limited financial resources, and human errors. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) is an established approach to manage security tools and assets. However, SOAR platforms typically integrate traditional IT systems only. Additional considerations are required to deal with the Internet of Things (IoT), its multiple devices and complex networks. Therefore, we adapt SOAR to IoT. We first aggregate existing research and information on SOAR and SOAR platforms. We envision the SOAR4IoT framework, making IoT assets manageable for SOAR via middleware. We implement a prototypical digital twin-based SOAR application integrating IoT assets and security tools to validate our framework. The experimental setup includes two playbooks coping with Mirai and Sybil attacks. Results show feasibility as our SOAR application enables securing IoT assets with digital twins.},

In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index. The evaluation model of machine tool is solved by Reference Ideal Method (RIM). Finally, the proposed decision-making approach for DMTS is tested in an aviation plant.},

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 is defined as connecting the physical system to the cyber world with the help of transformative technologies. As a result, the number of cyber-attacks have grown exponentially. Cybersecurity has been identified as one of main challenges in applying the transformative technologies of Industry 4.0. An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research. For this reason, a variety of software tools and virtualization methods have been used to create virtual or hybrid systems for researchers. This paper study and review existing cybersecurity research on CPS in the virtual environment. Then authors point out four challenges in the state-of-the-art research based on the findings and discussion. From this, Digital Twin (DT), one of the main enabling technologies in Industry 4.0, has been identified to have the great potential in solving these challenges. DT sheds light on the real fusion of the cyber world and the physical world, and it has the potential to be used as a technology to help people build virtulized system with high-fidelity, hence greatly lower bar on the cybersecurity research of the cyber physical system and create other DT based cybersecurity applications.},

Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs.

Existing solutions focus on physical process, control logic, or network communication simulation. Unfortunately, none of the Digital Twin solutions currently available provide a realistic and holistic solution to represent all three aspects. In this work, we propose the Digital HydrAuLic SIMulator (DHALSIM), a Digital Twin for water distribution systems that simulates physical, control, and network processes. DHALSIM builds on the integration of the Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR) hydraulic simulator and MiniCPS—an industrial network emulator—which are run in a co-simulation environment. Thanks to this integration, DHALSIM is able to simulate the hydraulic processes characterizing a water distribution system as well as full stack emulation of well-known industrial control protocols. The Digital Twin is demonstrated on the benchmark case study of C-Town, where we carry out a number of cyber-attack experiments. To our knowledge, DHALSIM is the first Digital Twin that implements a well known physics simulator with a virtual industrial logic and network emulation environment for water systems. DHALSIM is open source and available to the research community.},

There are key functional and quality requirements that apply to most Industry 4.0 systems independent of the application domain, e.g., requirements related to interoperability, recoverability, security, and modifiability. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of understanding of (i) architecture drivers that focus on these quality aspects and (ii) architecture solutions for these architecture drivers that are adequate for a wide range of Industry 4.0 contexts. To contribute to filling this gap, we present in this paper (i) quality-centered architecture drivers derived from industrial cases, and (ii) architecture solutions based on the concepts of Digital Twins, Service-Oriented Architecture, and Virtual Automation Bus for four recurrent production plant scenarios.

Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.},

abstract = {Digital twins play a key role in realizing the vision of a smart factory. While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.},

abstract = {Modern businesses are being subjected to an unprecedented variety of change drivers that cannot be predicted such as new regulations, emerging business models, and changing needs of stakeholders. This creates new demands on enterprises to meet stated goals in a dynamic and uncertain environment that translate to demands on the enterprise’s software systems. Software systems however are currently designed to deliver a fixed set of goals and assumed to operate in a static environment, falling short in addressing the need for continuous adaptation under uncertainty. State-of-the-art adaptation architectures like MAPE-K have been applied to meeting non-functional requirements in a dynamic environment using a static repository of knowledge. This paper articulates the need for architecting software systems that learn from their own operation to dynamically extend existing knowledge, and utilize the knowledge to meet stated functional goals in an uncertain environment.},

abstract = {A cyber–cyber digital twin is a simulation of a software system. By contrast, a cyber–physical digital twin is a simulation of a non-software (physical) system. Although cyber–physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber–cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber–cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber–cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber–cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber–cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical ramifications for the design, implementation and deployment of digital twins at Facebook.},

abstract = {An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.},

abstract = {In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.},

abstract = {A key challenge for manufacturers today is efficiently producing and delivering products on time. Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a "digital twin" of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.},

abstract = {Many enterprises outsource network management (e.g., troubleshooting failures, monitoring performance) to third-party managed service providers (MSPs) to reduce cost. Unfortunately, recent incidents show that MSPs themselves have become an attractive launchpad to gain access to customer networks. In this work, we argue that such incidents arise due to a violation of the least privilege principle. We revisit the MSP outsourcing problem through this least-privilege view, identify key challenges in realizing this framework, and present initial ideas toward this goal. In particular, we propose providing the MSP provider an isolated "digital twin" environment to resolve problems and prevent providers from directly accessing the customer production network. Changes are verified before importing them into the production network, ensuring there are no privilege violations. Our preliminary experiments show that our approach can resolve practical problems (e.g., misconfigurations) and is effective in reducing the attack surfaces for MSP customers.},

abstract = {Forests have crucial importance for the sustainability of Earth and humanity and one of the biggest threats to the existence of forests are the fires. This paper proposes a conceptual model for mitigating forest fire risk by use of self-adaptive and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Memoryless property of exponential distribution is also reflected and considered in the calculations of forest fire probabilities. Stochastic and dynamic properties of the situation and the mathematical complexity of the routing problem entailed and justified a simulation study. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach for routing UAVs and the validity of the proposed model are tested on a small sized realistic scenario. Experimental results encourage the development of complex models. Integrating the proposed model with advanced information technologies may lead to the development of a digital twin system.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Mesh technology can be used to realize heterogeneous IoT networks, consisting of a smart lighting backbone augmented with sensor-based applications. It offers many configuration options to adhere to the diverse application requirements and limit the overhead. Finding an optimal configuration of the network is a complex issue which leads to numerous performance-related questions. In this paper, Digital Twin technology is used to provide continuous and diverse insights into the network's behavior, under monitored or artificial network conditions. The twin is constantly connected to the physical network and combines selective simulation, graph algorithms and a data driven link model into a single toolbox. We evaluated its usage for smart lighting applications on a real-life testbed. The results indicate that the twin can produce end-to-end (E2E) latencies, E2E path distributions and a packet delivery ratio comparable to experiment outcomes in the physical network and in compliance with application requirements. Statistical validation of the similarity between measured and predicted E2E latency distributions indicates a Mean Absolute Error &lt; 10 % and a positive discrete Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for all results.},

abstract = {With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals.Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.},

abstract = {In Cloud Computing, the cloud serves as a central data hub for the Industrial Internet of Things' (IIoT) data and is deployed in diverse application fields, e.g., Smart Grid or Smart Manufacturing. Therefore, the aggregated and contextualized data is bundled in a central data hub, bringing tremendous cybersecurity advantages. Given the threat landscape in IIoT systems, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to be prepared regarding their cybersecurity, react quickly, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity. For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures. Thus, this paper conceptualizes a flexible security analytics service that implements security capabilities with flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs' needs. The security analytics service is also evaluated with a real-world use case.},

abstract = {The introduction of smart manufacturing is a new competitive advantage, a growth driver for the regions. The authors propose indicators of innovative activity in the field of smart manufacturing in the regions. The concept of a chain of the region's own means of production has been introduced. It is a set of 10 types of patents in the field of smart manufacturing registered in the region. They include the following patents: advanced manufacturing technologies, robotics, advanced materials, artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of things, mobility, photonics, security, digital twins. The most recent of these are digital twin technologies. Using the cluster method, the authors have grouped 43 regions according to the level of innovation in the field of smart manufacturing, based on data from WIPO and the European Commission for 2018. All this allowed the authors to develop a classification consisting of 11 strategies of innovation activity of regions in the field of smart manufacturing. On the basis of the scoring method, the authors have been asked to define the class of each region by the level of innovation in the field of smart manufacturing. For example, the United States received a high level of innovation in smart manufacturing (1st class). The remaining 42 regions were ranked as 2nd to 9th class of innovation activity in smart manufacturing. The potential for increased innovation has been identified in South Korea and Canada. This classification of strategies allows to study the experience of other regions in the field of smart manufacturing and to assess the investment risks of projects for smart factories.},

abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

abstract = {We present an approach for classifying 3D point clouds of indoor environments using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image analysis for entropy-selected 3D views. Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.},

abstract = {Today's software and hardware technologies enable the expansion of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) into the realms of mobility (car2x, autonomous driving), energy (power plants, smart grid) and healthcare (health monitoring), paving the way into a highly interlaced world. However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4]. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method. The envisioned method is supposed to be a holistic approach that supports the efficient cross-domain design, development, implementation and maintenance of dependable CPSs, where security and safety are a critical aspect that requires an in-depth risk assessment.},

abstract = {Background: The vision of a fourth industrial revolution lately strongly captured the attention of research A Cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the main drivers of this vision. Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions.Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results. Our findings highlight areas for future research and provide suggestions for investigation approaches.},

abstract = {Smart grid brings various advantages such as increased automation in decision making, tighter coupling between production and consumption, and increased digitalization. Because of the many changes that the smart grid inflicts on the power grid as critical infrastructure, cyber security and robust resilience against cyberattacks are essential to handle. With an increased number of attack interfaces and more use of IP-enabled communication, digital stations or IEC 61850 substations need to operate according to a zero-trust security model. Cyber resilience needs to be an integrated part of the substation and its components. This paper presents an experiment utilizing a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) Digital Station environment (enclave), where the focus is on attacking the SCADA protocol IEC 60870-5-104. We implemented 14 attacks, the attacks are described in detail, including the result of each attack action. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of the findings in the experiment and what power grid asset owners can do to protect their substations as part of their digitizing efforts.},

However, the parametrization of such models may be challenging, especially in the context of critical infrastructures where data is sometimes sparse. In this paper we propose different methods to parametrize a stochastic model of risk propagation depending on the amount of information available. Two of the approaches are illustrated with an example of a critical infrastructure and the application of the other methods is sketched.},

However, the TDs lack a way to describe the physical effect of said interactions on the device itself, as well as on the environment around the device, limiting its viability for cyber-physical scenarios. In this paper, we propose an extension for describing the effects of an interaction on the property affordances of a Thing in the TD as a first step towards a TD that is able to fully describe a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). We show this extension permits the generation of accurate Digital Twins, facilitates machine-aided system design and device mashup generation and allows for formal verification of the functionality of CPSs during their deployment and maintenance.},

abstract = {Increasing number of internet connected devices has paved a path for smarter ecosystems in various sectors such as agriculture, aquaculture, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Especially, integrating technologies like big data, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, etc. with internet connected devices has increased efficiency and productivity. Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.},

In order to meet these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trusted collaborative governance system for metaverse manufacturing, establishes a value-oriented metaverse trusted manufacturing framework in terms of both value-added and cost-reduction, and constructs a method for the essential elements of metaverse collaborative governance.

abstract = {Visually searching for physical entities can be challenging as other entities often block the targets. The rapid advancement of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and cyber-physical mappings in smart cities may offer an alternative solution, where users can quickly locate the target by manipulating the digital representations of their surrounding environments. For example, a user wearing an HMD can reveal the hidden target by “lifting” the cyber world to create a curved virtual map on top of the physical world. This paper presents a virtual reality (VR)-based preliminary study that investigates how such cyber-physical bending interaction affects visual search tasks. A virtual environment is used to emulate a physical world and its virtual twin. The results demonstrate that vertically bending the virtual twin can significantly improve users’ (N = 20) performance in a city infrastructure inspection task (160% faster) and a landmark navigation task (50% faster) in the virtual city environment.},

abstract = {As Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next logical stage of the Internet, it has become imperative to understand the vulnerabilities of the IoT systems when supporting diverse applications. Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.},

Businesses, governments, and individual users of smart technology expect a level of service and access to data that is achieved through data and supercomputing centers. These centers potentially consume vast amounts of power and their continued growth may be unsustainable and contribute to greenhouse gasses. As smart technologies rely heavily on such computational capabilities their sustainability is pivotal for a smart future. This paper explores the literature to: identify the problems; categorize the challenges as well as possible solutions; explore how simulation and machine learning can improve computational sustainability; and consider the need to conduct trade-off analysis to determine when to apply simulation and machine learning benefits.

The program was originally set up to use the waterfall software development approach with a traditional earned value (EV) scheme. It completed several iterations of development using this structure. The program then shifted to using a combination of Agile and DevSecOps. In this paper, we describe challenges encountered during this transition that inhibited realization of some of the benefits associated with Agile and DevSecOps. Largely, these challenges were a result of poor planning, engineering, and communication. We present this advisory account to others undertaking similar DevSecOps and Agile transitions, particularly in large organizations, so that they may better strategize and prepare methods to diminish similar shortcomings and increase the odds of a successful transition.},

abstract = {Resource scarcity is a global challenge, especially in E-mobility. Currently, Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as an attractive option on a pathway towards low emission mobility. Nevertheless, due to the increasing sales and acceptance of EVs, new challenges arise regarding the scarcity of utilized materials, especially regarding lithium-ion battery systems. Battery production is responsible for the major share of the environmental and economical impacts of the overall EV production. In order to tackle these challenges, resource-efficient processes and a circular use are necessary. Today, a variety of new Industry 4.0 technologies (such as high integrated production systems) are affordable and have reached maturity. Like Industry 4.0, also Recycling 4.0 aims at digitalization of processes but with the focus on the End of Life stage of products. The main goal of the German research project Recycling 4.0 is to develop approaches, which enable advanced information creation, transfer and use along the entire supply chain. In this work, a holistic approach towards an advanced circular economy (Recycling 4.0) is shown. This approach combines methods from different areas (such as economics, mechanical engineering, and computer science) and paves the way towards an advanced circular economy. This paper introduces this approach by discussing the current situation of EV recycling and related judicial fundamentals. Furthermore, the overall approach is introduced, and the discipline-specific sub-approaches are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Recent trends in networking are proposing the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the control and operation of the network. In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.},

Big Data technologies play a significant role within IoT processes, as visual analytics tools, generating valuable knowledge in real-time in order to support critical decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visualization methods, tools, and techniques for the IoT. We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.},

The IIoT forms the backbone for materializing the Industry 4.0 initiative. Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance. Intelligence refers to making optimal decisions for both automated and human-in-the-loop decision making. Condition-based predictive maintenance (CBPdM), also known as Maintenance 4.0, is among the major focus points of the Industry 4.0 and IIoT. In this paper, we discuss the existing standards related to condition-based maintenance and the potential of the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE), a MIMOSA led initiative, as a framework which extends previous open standards for achieving CBPdM. We illustrate how the framework addresses the requirements of Industry 4.0 and CBPdM.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical microgrids hold the key to a carbon-neutral power sector since they enable renewable and distributed energy resource integration, can alleviate overloaded distribution systems, and provide economic energy by generating and consuming power locally. The utilization of cyber-physical assets such as controllers, IoT sensors and actuators, and communication devices can enhance the stability and improve the control of microgrids. However, such assets, if maliciously operated, can become attack entry points and jeopardize the grid operation. Blind and uncoordinated cyber-attacks can be identified by existing security measures overcoming potential operational disruptions. However, rootkit attacks can stay hidden within cyber-physical systems and leverage system information to mask their presence. Rootkit detection is a strenuous process and requires advanced security methods due to their sophisticated operation. A careful analysis of possible rootkit target locations and their exploitation techniques is necessary to design effective threat detection and mitigation mechanisms. This paper discusses the cyber kill chain of a rootkit which can simultaneously deploy itself at multiple locations in a microgrid in a coordinated and stealthy way in order to maximize the impact on power system operations. The rootkit leverages system measurements to hide its presence and its attack impact from the detection mechanisms.},

Humanitarian assistance requiring short response time windows in almost the whole world may be subject to long queues due to managing problems, e.g., the lack of control and/or inefficient infrastructure. This work tackles such challenge by proposing a low-cost planning and managing model and method based on a discrete-event simulation mirror connected through WEB tools to a near or far management level. The usual configuration of parallel servers (for instance, supported by local RFID monitoring) is implemented by a discrete-event simulation model that is validated by Jackson Networks (and vice versa). The results show a flexible model that may identify bottlenecks in advance in order to accommodate traffic flow variations.},

Advances in computing speed, algorithmic improvements, and access to a vast amount of data contributed to the adaption of AI in many different domains. Due to the outstanding performance, AI technology is increasingly integrated into safety-critical applications. However, the established safety engineering processes and practices have been only successfully applied in conventional model-based system development and no commonly agreed approaches for integrating AI technology are available yet. This work presents two architectural patterns that can support designers and engineers in the conception of safety-critical AI-enhanced cyber-physical system (CPS) applications. The first pattern addresses the problem of integrating AI capabilities into safety-critical functions. The second pattern deals with architectural approaches to integrate AI technologies for monitoring and learning system-specific behavior at runtime.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes more and more pervasive, encompassing many aspects of our daily life, the issue of how much the IoT systems can be trusted is critical. However, the multitude of recent incidents that were caused by or somehow involved such systems, often with dire consequences, makes it obvious that IoT system trustworthiness is not yet attained this paper we provide an overview on IoT trustworthiness, and introduce a trustworthiness assurance methodology based on the novel concept of Trustworthiness Assurance Levels (TALs). The methodology is intended for analyzing IoT systems to determine the degree of confidence one can have that they will perform as expected for a given deployment, taking into consideration external disturbances, system errors, faults and attacks. The paper also includes a case study discussion to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Co-simulation is an increasingly important topic concerning future Industry 4.0 architectures as well as a part of modern design engineering approaches and testing structures for real production environments. It is an arising well-used enabling technique and is beneficial for the simulation of a coupled system by composing the simulations of its single parts. In this context, standardized information exchange is a requirement among production entities and the whole supply chain. Information models become a fundamental part for describing semantic exchange of data in a standardized way. These models can be customized according to the needs of a specific company or departments. At the moment, the testing of the communication structure and the overall interoperability between the communication partners in a production line is not checked until the real commissioning and later stages of a project. For the functionality and quality of the later established architecture it is still helpful to test information models and their functions in a static as well as a dynamic way beforehand. Oftentimes, an intelligent system is missing that fulfills these requirements of a dynamic and flexible testing. This paper focusses therefore on a concept for a co-simulation environment that accompanies different stages in the planning and virtual commissioning process.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have gained popularity due to the increased requirements on their uninterrupted connectivity and process automation. Due to their connectivity over the network including intranet and internet, dependence on sensitive data, heterogeneous nature, and large-scale deployment, they are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are performed by creating anomalies in the normal operation of the systems with a goal either to disrupt the operation or destroy the system completely. The study proposed here focuses on detecting those anomalies which could be the cause of cyber-attacks. This is achieved by deriving the rules that govern the physical behavior of a process within a plant. These rules are called Invariants. We have proposed a Data-Centric approach (DaC) to generate such invariants. The entire study was conducted using the operational data of a functional smart power grid which is also a living lab.},

abstract = {A design-centric modeling approach was proposed to model the behaviour of the physical processes controlled by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and study the cascading impact of data-oriented attacks. A threat model was used as input to guide the construction of the CPS model where control components which are within the adversary's intent and capabilities are extracted. The relevant control components are subsequently modeled together with their control dependencies and operational design specifications. The approach was demonstrated and validated on a water treatment testbed. Attacks were simulated on the testbed model where its resilience to attacks was evaluated using proposed metrics such as Impact Ratio and Time-to-Critical-State. From the analysis of the attacks, design strengths and weaknesses were identified and design improvements were recommended to increase the testbed's resilience to attacks.},

abstract = {There has been increasing interest in and demand for relevant datasets for machine learning-based anomaly detection research in academia and industry. The industrial control system (ICS) has become larger and more complex, and it is difficult for humans to understand the configuration and operation of the system. Normal and attack scenario plans based on partial knowledge are inevitably biased, and insufficient data annotations limit the performance verification. It is practically difficult to manually identify all tags used for system monitoring and control and their causal relationships. Therefore, we propose a method to generate a data flow graph from process control information such as input/output tags, control processes, and various control parameter values extracted from the database of the control system. It will be the basis for systematic scenario composition and provide information for the analysis of cause and ripple effects when the state of a specific point (control device, sensor, actuator, etc.) is changed. We applied the proposed method to a HAI testbed and confirmed its feasibility by using it to develop a dataset.},

abstract = {IBM Cloud for EducationEarlier this year, IBM formally launched the IBM Cloud for Education. It represents a single access point - "one stop shopping" - within its standard IBM Cloud menu, whereby faculty and students will be able to access an array of resources and services specifically addressing their in-classroom and research needs. These include the IBM Cloud Application Lab (based on the original Apache VCL open source cloud platform), Learn@IBM (a Moddle-based collection of educational modules initially developed by CAS Canada Lab), a library of pre-packaged software images and platforms popular with many academicians, and more - integrated with many of the most requested IBM services (including IBM Watson and AI, IoT, blockchain and more).Many of these images, platforms and modules have been created in partnership with university collaborators for their specific academic needs (including the Apache VCL cloud platform itself). The IBM Cloud for Education is therefore intended to become a repository of cloud-based reusable assets that are being developed for courses or projects around data/AI, security, blockchain, quantum computing and more. Most importantly, these solutions can be easily hybridized with an institution's on-premise infrastructure or edge devices, can support any operating system or hypervisor - as well as Kubernetes - and can be accessed by a simple browser on any device. They can even be deployed within any third party vendor's hosted cloud.},

abstract = {Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based models of CPS (also called Digital Twins) are becoming important in the design and control of modern CPS. CPS are a unique class of intelligent system, where the governing process models for the system (or its parts) are available to inform decision making. The governing physics or chemistry models provide an additional source of information, potentially improving the accuracy of CPS modeling, but also increasing the complexity of the information fusion process. The resource constraints of CPS, however, makes it hard to perform the information fusion within the CPS itself. Moreover, building a large, monolithic model of the complete CPS is also infeasible due to model size and training complexity. The hierarchical and compositional structure of CPS calls for distributed model training and composition. Resource constraints and real-time control needs call for rapid and low-cost training of models, which makes surrogate modeling a promising approach. However, when surrogate models are composed, their approximate nature may lead to larger errors. Further, data-driven models are prone to adversarial attacks, whose impacts may be even more pronounced in a federated model. This position paper highlights the key research challenges in this realm and need for new research.},

Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resource being protected and be generated dynamically by resources depending on the context in which the resource is being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.},

This discussion paper advocates the Semantic Networking vision, explicitly exposing communication semantics as the essential abstraction for its runtime realization.

abstract = {A central vision of the Internet of Things is the representation of the physical world in a consistent virtual environment. Especially in the context of smart factories the connection of the different, heterogeneous production modules through a digital shop floor promises faster conversion rates, data-driven maintenance or automated machine configurations for use cases which haven't been recognized at design time. Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.},

abstract = {Rapid technology advancement, economic growth, and industrialization have paved the way for developing a new niche of small body-worn personal devices, gathered together under a wearable-technology title. The triggers stimulated by end-users interest have introduced the first generation of mass-consumer wearables in just the past decade. Evidently, the trailblazing ones were not designed with strict energy-consumption restrictions in mind. Thus, wearable-computing-related research remained fragmented. Advanced and sophisticated batteries and communication technologies could be already procurable on devices. Additional solutions for efficient utilization of processing power are still a white spot on the wearable technology roadmap. A-WEAR EU project aims to enhance the understanding of how the superimposition of those technologies would improve wearable devices' energy efficiency, with the research area being far from saturation. We foresee enormous room for research as the Edge computing paradigm is emerging towards hand-held devices.},

abstract = {More and more attentions have been paid to the value of big data, and the amount of research literature on big data is also increasing exponentially. In this paper, CiteSpace citation analysis software is used as an analysis tool and big data related literature in the Web of Science core database during 2011- 2021 is used as an analysis object. The major task is to create the knowledge map of big data with multi-dimension, build knowledge graphs of big data from several perspectives and develop visual analyses of the literature. From the sight of time and space. Differences between the numbers and the research contents of literature on big data published by different countries, regions, and institutions have been analyzed and compared; By co-cited literature, the classical papers and core literature in the field of big data have been detected, and the development context of big data domain have been clarified; Cluster analysis has been conducted on hot keywords to find the research hotspots of big data domain in recent years. Burst words detection algorithm has been used to track the research frontiers and development trends in the field of big data. The results show that China has surpassed the developed countries in Europe and the United States in the number of literature on big data. However, there is still a lack of core technology literature. The development of big data and AI will be in the same direction and depend on each other; The improvement of deep learning algorithms based of big data analysis is going to become a frontier research topic in a long-term; The integration of big data and all walks of life should to be deepened, and researchers need to find the breakthrough points for the application of big data based on the characteristics of the industry.},

abstract = {In a global economy with many competitive participants, licensing and tracking of 3D printed parts is desirable if not mandatory for many use-cases. We investigate a blockchain-based approach, as blockchains provide many attractive features, like decentralized architecture and high security assurances. An often neglected aspect of the product life-cycle management is the confidentiality of transactions to hide valuable business information from competitors. To solve the combined problem of trust and confidentiality, we present a confidential licensing and tracking system which works on any publicly verifiable, token-based blockchain that supports tokens of different types representing licenses or attributes of parts. Together with the secure integration of a unique eID in each part, our system provides an efficient, immutable and authenticated transaction log scalable to thousands of transactions per second. With our confidential Token-Based License Management system (cTLM), large industries such as automotive or aviation can license and trace all parts confidentially.},

abstract = {The prevalence of IoT enabled devices in the home has manifested in buildings as voice and gesture enabled devices that enable functions such as optimizing energy usage and controlling electrical fixtures. However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building's design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an "operating system" for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency. Methods for personalizing building performance to users can also be accomplished through the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs) are made of droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (the same material under the screen of our mobile phones) but molded in a spherical shape and hardened into a solid. CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves to the digital era, improving the collaboration among its partners using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) tools. In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides to smart buildings novel mechanisms to embed Internet of Things (IoT) architectures, as well as to perform end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing between project actors. However, this openness and high decentralization of BIM and IoT services of smart buildings leads to several security issues that the use of Blockchain has been proved to provide an effective layer of data protection. This paper examines the interconnection and interoperability of BIM, IoT, Blockchain and advanced digital technologies in the demanding environment of a museum, where efficient and secure monitoring and management are critical factors that should be satisfied. It focuses on the application of the aforementioned technologies in the context of a building that has to deal with multiple administrative requirements, the management and protection of the exhibition areas and the objects exposed in them, the security and the convenience of the visitors, the financial management of the tickets and the profits from museum shops, the workshops, the laboratories and the storage areas, which usually contain numerous invaluable artifacts.},

abstract = {One of the major steps between (re-)configuration of a factory and the start of production is the commissioning phase, where certification of safety requirements and assessment of potential hazards is a key activity. Typically, assessment of safety risks is a manual process that incorporates the experience and knowledge of the involved stakeholders. The flexibility and the speed gained by automated (re-)configuration of production environments is decelerated by the manual safety certification process, before the factory can start production. This paper is an attempt to eliminate this bottleneck by proposing a model-driven approach to safety risk assessment. An approach based on several models of safety risks enables potential safety risks to be "instantiated" for any given factory at hand. This shortens the recurring process of identifying the risks. A model-driven approach was chosen to capture and utilize the tacit knowledge of the involved stakeholders.},

In order to accurately identify the key nodes of high-speed railway and further improve the protection ability, we carried out the data mining on the two aspects of supply and demand of high-speed railway. Considering the functional characteristics of high-speed railway transportation and the imbalance between supply and demand, the paper analyzesd the complex network of high-speed railway, which is first upgraded to the directed transportation network and then reduced to the undirected hierarchical network. And the marginal utility model and the competitive opportunity gravity model were used as the supply and demand indexes, and the comprehensive analysis of high-speed railway network is carried out by the method of comprehensive quantification of damage utility to quantify the protection priority value of the network system. The results of case analysis showed that the difference of network demand was obvious, and the fluctuation of supply difference was small. Compared with single analysis, the comprehensive analysis result was more accurate and instructive, which reduced the mistake of subjective judgment based on previous empiricism due to the limitation of people's consciousness, and provided theoretical basis for the decision-making of high-speed railway network protection priority and the allocation of protection resources.},

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) as an integrated part of ETSI standard 5G architecture promises better user experience, resource utilization and application performance by bringing computing and storage facilities at the edge of the network, closer to the data sources. Urban informatics, which is used for better realization of future smart cities, can leverage the power of MEC for real-time analysis and inference from massive amount of multimodal sensory data. This tutorial focuses on the scope and capabilities of MEC in the broad domain of urban informatics. We will discuss MEC fundamentals including the architecture, major technology enablers like SDN, NFV, etc., specific challenges covering resource management, offloading, caching and migration of content/task, and future research directions. Then we plan to motivate the audience with the relevance and scope of further research in urban computing and urban informatics giving special attention to urban information systems (UIS). The premise of UIS management revolves around sensing, forwarding, and processing of real-time multimodal sensory data at the network edge. Finally we bring in the challenges associated with MEC based data management for different application verticals covering health, pollution, transportation, governance and so on with a specific case study in the connected/autonomous vehicles domain.},

IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution. Finally, we conclude this survey with an inherent discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.},

abstract = {Whether testing intrusion detection systems, conducting training exercises, or creating data sets to be used by the broader cybersecurity community, realistic user behavior is a critical component of a cyber range. Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user’s behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data—Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer—are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is experiencing fast booming in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with the emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performances of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.},

Although Things undergo changes with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications during their lifetime, the WoT TD is currently inteded to be of a static nature. This remains contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things along their lifecycle. This work researches the lifecycle aspect for Things in the IoT and the different stakeholders influencing Things and respectively their TD.

Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.},

abstract = {IoT-based technologies growing all over the world. After the industrial revolution, machines and robots gradually replaced human effort. In the absence of the human brain-machine and robots makes an error. In this paper, a plan was developed to get out of this situation that works not only efficiently but also thinks like humans. In this system, the machine will learn based on the situation that has been made by any occurrence. In this work Raspberry Pi-based system helps to make a proper analysis of the machines. Voltage, current, gas value, and temperate values are taken as input parameters. Machine learning matches/compares these real-time sensor data with training data (which is used to train the system). As a result, The machine learning module provides some statistics graphs of sensor data. Machine performance can analyze by observing these graphs. Also, determine the efficiency and predict the possibility of upcoming threats or risks.},

Augmented reality (AR) is a promising solution for the emerging design needs due to its diverse opportunities for user interaction and presenting information. This paper supports the development of novel AR applications. We describe a corresponding use case set consisting of 98 examples from a literature review and two focus groups. Based on these samples we present a design space for in-car AR applications. To demonstrate the benefit thereof, we show a fictional design process including our proposed design space to derive a custom AR system. This work supports designers and engineers by providing a systematic approach for integrating 3D AR interfaces in a vehicle, excluding windshields and windows.},

abstract = {Although there are methods of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to virtual reality (VR) solutions, there are few studies in the literature. Thus, to fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of these methods. In this review, we apply a methodology proposed in the literature that locates existing studies, selects and evaluates contributions, analyses, and synthesizes data. We used Google Scholar and databases such as Elsevier's Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select documents. The results showed that when AI methods are used in VR applications, the main advantages are high efficiency and precision of algorithms. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is the most applied AI scientific technique in VR applications. In conclusion, this paper showed that the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends, opportunities, and applications for human-machine interactive devices, education, agriculture, transport, 3D image reconstruction, and health. We more concluded that the usage of AI in VR provides potential benefits in other fields of the real world such as teleconferencing, emotion interaction, tourist services, and image data extraction.},

We evaluated the proposed technology from the viewpoint of storage capacity. The data sharing method has two management type, centralized management and distributed management. As a result of examining for the feasibility of the proposed distributed management technology, the required maximum storage capacity is 128.6 GB per each organization' data management system. Therefore, we got a certain outlook that distributed management technology is feasible.},

abstract = {Smart ear-worn devices (called earables) are being equipped with various onboard sensors and algorithms, transforming earphones from simple audio transducers to multi-modal interfaces making rich inferences about human motion and vital signals. However, developing sensory applications using earables is currently quite cumbersome with several barriers in the way. First, time-series data from earable sensors incorporate information about physical phenomena in complex settings, requiring machine-learning (ML) models learned from large-scale labeled data. This is challenging in the context of earables because large-scale open-source datasets are missing. Secondly, the small size and compute constraints of earable devices make on-device integration of many existing algorithms for tasks such as human activity and head-pose estimation difficult. To address these challenges, we introduce Auritus, an extendable and open-source optimization toolkit designed to enhance and replicate earable applications. Auritus serves two primary functions. Firstly, Auritus handles data collection, pre-processing, and labeling tasks for creating customized earable datasets using graphical tools. The system includes an open-source dataset with 2.43 million inertial samples related to head and full-body movements, consisting of 34 head poses and 9 activities from 45 volunteers. Secondly, Auritus provides a tightly-integrated hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) optimizer and TinyML interface to develop lightweight and real-time machine-learning (ML) models for activity detection and filters for head-pose tracking. To validate the utlity of Auritus, we showcase three sample applications, namely fall detection, spatial audio rendering, and augmented reality (AR) interfacing. Auritus recognizes activities with 91% leave 1-out test accuracy (98% test accuracy) using real-time models as small as 6-13 kB. Our models are 98-740x smaller and 3-6% more accurate over the state-of-the-art. We also estimate head pose with absolute errors as low as 5 degrees using 20kB filters, achieving up to 1.6x precision improvement over existing techniques. We make the entire system open-source so that researchers and developers can contribute to any layer of the system or rapidly prototype their applications using our dataset and algorithms.},

The ways of implementing digitalization in the Russian energy sector are considered, identifies opportunities for improving the organizational and economic mechanism of the energy sector digitalization, and forms methodological recommendations for the digital transition implementation. The authors have concluded that the existing energy sector digitalization mechanisms do not correspond to the growth of the involvement in the digital economy. In this regard, the team of authors proposed an improved organizational and economic mechanism for creating a digital environment in the energy sector. It is concluded that the existing mechanisms for the transfer of information (digitalization) of asset classes of an energy enterprise do not correspond to the growth of involvement in the digital economy. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the development of an approach to the modernization of generating equipment, taking into account the current trend of digitalization of the electric power industry, which will increase the economic efficiency of CHP and its investment attractiveness. A distinctive feature of the proposed event is the analysis of digitalization indicators, which make it possible to assess the degree and readiness for digitalization of the station. The proposed mechanism has been tested on the example of a thermal power plant in the Moscow region.},

Among the vast amount of MBD research results, despite the bibliometric analysis, it does not provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge trends and developments in MBD research due to the small amount of data and poor timeliness. Therefore, based on the 3353 publications retrieved from Web of Science between 2002 and 2022, this paper performed quantitative, various kinds of cooperative networks, clustering networks, keywords, frontier trends and main path analysis. The conclusions are as follows. (1) MBD research findings are increasing at an even higher rate. (2) Research contribution differs widely between countries and institutions, and is relatively average between authors and journals. (3) MBD research frontiers show a tendency to span a wide range of disciplines and to be strongly associated with Internet technologies. (4) According to the results of the main path analysis, health IoT and medical big data are the hot spots for MBD research.},

Building a huge infrastructure for the verification purposes is often too costly and impractical in the production environment therefore it is necessary to find other ways to test architectural approaches and algorithms. One of them is simulators. For simulating very big systems like a telecommunications radio access network the simulator should have certain features: capability of simulating a huge number of services, possibility to model heterogenic and vast network, facility to add a new type of services and logic.

abstract = {The continuous growth of airport operations generates continuous infrastructure expansion needs at international airports. In some cases, in the face of limitations in short-term expansions, the immediate solution is the creation of remote positions that allow a greater number of flights to be attended but which require the use of bus fleets to attend passenger boarding and disembarking operations. The sizing of the buses will allow to reduce the waiting times of flights below the level of service required by international standards. For this purpose, the development of a discrete event simulation model integrated to the transactional flight database is proposed. In the literature, although many references to simulation models have been found in airports, they have not been specifically focused in order to size and manage the bus fleet. Simulation experiments of this model under the management of scenarios allows to identify the bus fleet size required.},

abstract = {In the recent revival of human labour in industry, and the subsequent push to optimally combine the strengths of man and machine in industrial processes, there is an increased need for methods allowing machines to understand and interpret the actions of their users. An important aspect of this is the understanding and evaluation of the progress of the workflows that are to be executed. Methods for this require both an appropriate choice of sensors, as well as algorithms capable of quickly and efficiently evaluating activity and workflow progresse this paper we present such an algorithm, which provides activity and workflow recognition using both depth and RGB cameras as input. The algorithm's main purpose is to be used in an industrial training station, allowing novice workers to learn the necessary steps in assembling nordic ski products without the need for human supervision. We will describe how the algorithm recognizes predefined workflows in the sensor data, and present a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance on a real data recording of operators performing their work in an industrial setting. We will show that the algorithm fulfills the necessary requirements and is ready to be implemented in the training station application.},

abstract = {When developing autonomous systems, engineers and other stakeholders make great efforts to prepare the system for all foreseeable circumstances. However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.},

abstract = {Systems engineering is a bit different from other engineering disciplines in that students from many disciplines are enrolled in the program. Therefore, the objective is not to teach a simulation subject in depth, but rather to introduce the students to different techniques so that they can work with and manage simulation staff on a project. However, they need some "hands on" experience so that they know how challenging simulations can be, avoiding the trap of underestimating the effort involved. This paper describes the approach used at Georgia Tech to teach a compressed 7 week simulation survey course called ASE 6003 Modeling &amp; Simulation in Systems Engineering. We describe the techniques used, our approach and the results achieved over recent years of teaching simulation in this format.

abstract = {The growing global competition for implementation of the "Industry 4.0" concept prioritizes issues connected with the shift of the national industry to a digital technology platform. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), based on the Internet of things technology, is currently adopting the position of the main driving force of the industrial revolution, while being one of the key factors for improving production efficiency. Development of the IIoT projects will result in the improvement of industrial efficiency, thereby having an enormous effect on the world economy. As a result, potential consequences will not only enhance the industry itself, but also many other aspects of social life related to it, such as living standards, labor market, education, political system, and etc. This study observes the history and prerequisites for the Industrial Revolution, identifies its main characteristics, and concentrates on the most advanced technologies. The research considers foreign experience in implementation of state programs in the Industry 4.0; defines a role of the Internet of things as a technological basis for a new digital economy; studies the IIoT concept as a key factor in the evolution of the Industrial Revolution; examines main advantages of the IIoT, its impact and projected consequences for the world economy; provides examples of implementation of the IIoT projects in the Russian and foreign markets; analyzes specific characteristics of the IIoT development in the Russian economy, as well as the factors hindering implementation of the IIoT projects. As a result of this study, priority tasks and prospects for development of the Industrial Internet of Things were outlined and evaluated.},

To keep pace with the fast growing automotive market, reusability of components and features is today the key to reduce costs and time-to-market. Especially when systems are safety-critical and demand reliability, new methods and tools are thus essential to support the reusability aspect in the development process. A model-based approach, in conjunction, moreover helps to communicate between different stakeholders, provides different views and serves as a central storage of information. Through applying reliability analysis and simulation-based verification methods on our hardware model and furthermore automatic generation of a first virtual prototype, we are able to reduce the tools involved, thus resulting in correctness, completeness and consistency of the entire system.},

abstract = {Smart city technologies promise reduced congestion by optimizing transportation movements. Increased connectivity, however, may increase the attack surface of a municipality's critical functions. Increased supply chain attacks (up nearly 80 % in 2019) and municipal ransomware attacks (up 60 % in 2019) motivate the need for holistic approaches to risk assessment. Therefore, we present a methodology to quantify the degree to which supply-chain movements may be observed or disrupted via compromised smart-city devices. Our data-processing pipeline uses publicly available datasets to model intermodal commodity flows within and surrounding a municipality. Using a hierarchy tree to adaptively sample spatial networks within geographic regions of interest, we bridge the gap between grid- and network-based risk assessment frameworks. Results based on fieldwork for the Jack Voltaic exercises sponsored by the Army Cyber Institute demonstrate our approach on intermodal movements through Charleston, SC and San Diego, CA.},

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.},

The modeling notations employed to design, verify, and operate such systems have increasingly started to capture different types of uncertainty, so that they can be explicitly considered when systems are developed and deployed. While these modeling paradigms consider different sources of uncertainty individually, these sources are rarely independent, and their interactions affect the achievement of system goals in subtle and often unpredictable ways. This vision paper describes the problem of uncertainty interaction in software-intensive systems, illustrating it on examples from relevant application domains. We then identify key open challenges and define desiderata that future modeling notations and model-driven engineering research should consider to address these challenges.},

abstract = {The distributed Cloud Computing paradigm is continuously being adopted within the industrial automation domain. The most distinguishing feature of these Edge Clouds relates to their ability to provide low-latency and even hard realtime services. As infrastructure deployments can be rather heterogeneous in their nature, service providers require precise means for estimating end-to-end application latency behavior, in order to know performance boundaries that can be met for defining certain Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Although network performance tools exist for many years, mechanisms for assessing hard real-time performance of applications in distributed Edge Cloud environments have not been considered extensively yet. Therefore, we use a built-in feature of the Linux Kernel, the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), to measure delays between targeted endpoints in the kernel stack, that enable the user to gain deeper and more accurate measurements of events as compared to generalized approaches (as accurate as eBPF / the time-stamping facility from the kernel). As a result, the real-time behavior of particular Edge Cloud deployments, including its hosted applications, can be profiled in detail by end-users as well as service-providers. Within our evaluation we have monitored a cyclic transmission of packets with a scheduled delay of under 190 μs and measured a round trip time under 2 ms. Future work include profiling the real-time behavior of potentially hosted time-critical applications, such as virtual Programmable Logic Controllers (vPLCs), over real-time networks, such Time Sensitive Networking (TSN); the extension towards dynamically configured real-time networks; and finally its application to future organic, self-optimizing Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication 6G core networks.},

Mobile devices have become the main tool available for travellers, which enables the diffusion of augmented reality solutions through this channel. Based on that, a virtual guide prototype was developed to enhance the museum visitors experience inside a famous attraction from Foz do Igua\c{c}u, the Ecomuseu, constructed with the objective to show the work of Itaipu’s hydroelectric power plant and the history regarding the region occupied by its reservoir. The developed application inserts virtual elements in different locations of the museum. Whenever such elements are “captured”, they tell the visitor information about what is being exhibited so the perception of the visitor and knowledge absorption can be improved. To validate the proposed solution, we tested the app with 15 different users. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted the app and performed the evaluation over the virtual tour of the same museum, which is available online. For the sake of our knowledge, this is the first time an augmented reality application is evaluated over a virtual representation of a museum. Despite the difficulties imposed by the current context, the feedback from the tested users was very positive.},

These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.},

The main challenge of е-rulemaking platforms is to support an “intelligent” deliberative process that enables decision makers to identify a wide range of options, weigh the relevant considerations, and develop epistemically responsible solutions. This article discusses and critiques two approaches to this challenge: The Cornell RegulationRoom project and model of computationally assisted regulatory participation by Livermore et al. It then proceeds to explore two alternative approaches to e-rulemaking: One is based on the implementation of collaborative, wiki-styled tools. This article discusses the findings of an experiment, which was conducted at Bar-Ilan University and explored various aspects of a wiki-based collaborative е-rulemaking system.

abstract = {Discrete manufacturing systems are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) and their availability, performance, and quality have a big impact on the economy. Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. In this paper, we present SDCWorks---a modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It consists of the semantic structures for creating models, a baseline controller, and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator for SDCWorks models. We provide the semantics of such a manufacturing system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, and monitoring. We illustrate the expressive power of SDCWorks by modeling the realistic SMART manufacturing testbed of University of Michigan. We show how our open source SDCWorks simulator can be used to evaluate relevant metrics (throughput, latency, and load) for example manufacturing systems.},

As a result of these initiatives, manufacturing firms have started to integrate a series of emerging technologies into their processes that will change the way products are designed, manufactured, and consumed. This article provides a comprehensive review of how service-oriented computing is being employed to develop the required software infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and identifies the major challenges and research opportunities that ensue. Particular attention is paid to the microservices architecture, which is increasingly recognized as offering a promising approach for developing innovative industrial applications. This literature review is based on the current state of the art on service computing for Industry 4.0 as described in a large corpus of recently published research papers, which helped us to identify and explore a series of challenges and opportunities for the development of this emerging technology frontier, with the goal of facilitating its widespread adoption.},

abstract = {A systems-of-systems (SoS) is a class of systems characterized by the collaboration among independent constituent systems, each one with its own purposes and functionalities and interacting with the others aiming to meet common global missions. An essential characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.},

This research proposed two experiments using Artificial Intelligence and deep learning are used to demonstrate the problems and solutions regarding methods in manufacturing and factory facilities, respectively. In the first experiment, a Bayesian network inference is used to find the cause of the problem of metal residues between electronic circuits through key process and quality correlations. In the second experiment, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to identify false defects that were over-inspected during Automatic Optical Inspection. This improves the manufacturing process by enhancing yield rate and reducing cost. The contributions of the study in circuit board production. Smart manufacturing, with the application of a Bayesian network to an IoT setup, has addressed the problem of residue and redundant conductors on the edge of the ceramic circuit board pattern, and has improved and prevented leakage and high-frequency interference. CNN and deep learning were used to improve the accuracy of the AOI system, reduce the current manual review ratio, save labour costs and provide defect classification as a reference for pre-process improvement.},

Previous PD studies have supported migrants’ social inclusion through developing their social capital and empowerment. Very few studies explored the facilitation of intercultural interactions within everyday contexts, like public places; further, most studies provide western perspectives. Addressing this gap, we conducted a focus group study with migrants and locals living in Istanbul, a city connecting eastern and western cultures, to explore how they perceive intercultural meaningful social interactions (IMSI). We asked participants to share poems about meaningful interactions, opening a dialogue about their intercultural life experiences. This technique allowed us to identify abstract qualities of IMSI and factors that influence them. We contribute to PD work on social inclusion by presenting in-between perspectives of IMSI and discussing opportunities for facilitating IMSI in a super-diverse city.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz)-band communications have been envisioned as a key technology to support ultra-high-data-rate applications in 5G-beyond (or 6G) wireless networks. Compared to the microwave and mmWave bands, the main challenges with the THz band are in its i) large path loss hence limited network coverage and ii) visible-light-like propagation characteristics hence poor support of mobility in blockage-rich environments. This paper studies quantitatively the applicability of THz-band communications in blockage-rich mobile environments, focusing on a new network scenario called <italic>FlyTera</italic>. In <italic>FlyTera</italic>, a set of hotspots mounted on flying drones collaboratively provide data streaming services to ground users, in the microwave, mmWave and THz bands. We first provide a mathematical formulation of the <italic>FlyTera</italic> control problem, where the objective is to maximize the network spectral efficiency by jointly controlling the flight of the drone hotspots, their association to the ground users, and the spectrum bands used by the users. To solve the resulting problem, which is shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear nonconvex programming (MINLP) problem, we design distributed solution algorithms based on a combination of echo state learning and reinforcement learning. An extensive simulation campaign is then conducted with SimBAG, a newly developed <underline>Sim</underline>ulator of <underline>B</underline>roadband <underline>A</underline>erial-<underline>G</underline>round wireless networks. It is shown that no single spectrum band can meet the requirements of high data rate and wide coverage simultaneously. Moreover, from the network-level point of view, THz-band communications can significantly benefit from the mobility of the flying drones, and on average <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$4 - 6$ </tex-math></inline-formula> times <italic>higher (rather than lower)</italic> throughput can be achieved in mobile than in static environments.},

abstract = {Smart devices have been widely adopted in our daily life. A smart home system, e.g., Home Assistant and openHAB, can be equipped with hundreds and even thousands of smart devices. A smart home system communicates with smart devices through various device integrations, each of which is responsible for a specific kind of devices. Developing high-quality device integrations is a challenging task, in which developers have to properly handle the heterogeneity of different devices, unexpected exceptions, etc. We find that device integration bugs, i.e., iBugs, are prevalent and have caused various consequences, e.g., causing devices unavailable, unexpected device behaviors. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on 330 iBugs in Home Assistant, the most popular open source smart home system. We investigate their root causes, trigger conditions, impacts, and fixes. From our study, we obtain many interesting findings and lessons that are helpful for device integration developers and smart home system designers. Our study can open up new research directions for combating iBugs in smart home systems.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its expansion into homes, businesses, government, and industries, the impact for computer science educators is amplified. In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

abstract = {Many facts change over time, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical environment. In the case of pandemic articles, the user is not interested in the creation date of the document, but in the facts and the cause of the last pandemic. Fake news can be better combated by having a document with a temporal focus. Currently, neither the sequence of events nor the temporal focus is considered when obtaining news documents. Despite the limited number of temporal aspects in the available datasets, it is difficult to test and evaluate the temporal conclusions of the model. The goal of this work is to develop a temporal focus news article retrieval model based on co-training to advance research in semi-supervised learning. A mapping of the dataset is performed using 1) the evolving focus time of news articles, 2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors for learning neural contrast embedding models generating focus time-based query in sequential news articles to facilitate temporal understanding by learning low-dimensional continuous vectors. A diverse dataset of news articles is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With semi-supervised learning and lexicon expansion, the result of the developed model can achieve 89%. The method performed better than previous baselines and traditional machine learning models with improvements of 12.65% and 4.7%, respectively.},

The question of what will the cities of the future look like is at the heart of urban studies. In parallel, a similar question is posed by (trans)humanists about the future of humanity and its possible technological enhancements. However, (trans)humanity and future cities are defined in a bi-directional dependency. Therefore, we have to answer the questions of future humans and cities simultaneously. This paper maps several ways of interacting between transhuman communities and smart cities to understand their possible effects on governing, design and society at large resulting in a framework that will work as a cautionary tale and an inspirational blueprint for imagining future urbanity.},

abstract = {The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 \texttimes{} 200 \texttimes{} 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.},

abstract = {Driven by the core technologies, i.e., sensor-based autonomous data acquisition and the cloud-based big data analysis, IoT automates the actuation of data-driven intelligent actions on the connected objects. This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.},

abstract = {Tactile Internet based Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) are highly sensitive to component and communication latencies and packet drops. Building a high performing TCPS, thus, necessitates experimenting with different hardware, algorithms, access technologies, and communication protocols. To facilitate such experiments, we have developed TCPSbed, a modular testbed for TCPS. TCPSbed facilitates the integration of different components, both real and simulated, to realize different TCPS applications and evaluate their latency and control performances. TCPSbed’s latency analyzer tool employs a novel method to isolate latencies of individual TCPS components such as the latencies contributed by actuation, sensing, algorithms, and by the network, all in an online fashion. TCPSbed’s method of analyzing stability is also novel. It involves the use of the step response analysis method, a classic control-theoretic method used for analyzing the stability of generic control systems. TCPSbed’s support for edge intelligence modules enables prediction of command and feedback signals at the network’s edge allowing TCPS applications to perform well in adverse network conditions. TCPSbed’s source-code, made available through our GitHub page <italic>TactileInternet</italic>, allows developers to extend its features and functionalities further. In this paper, we describe the architecture and implementation details of TCPSbed and demonstrate its features through several proof-of-concept experiments.},

abstract = {Entrepreneurs, enterprises, and governments are using distributed ledger technology (DLT) as a component of complex information systems, and therefore interoperability capabilities are required. Interoperating DLTs enables network effects, synergies and, similarly to the rise of the Internet, it unlocks the full potential of the technology. However, due to the novelty of the area, interoperability mechanisms (IM) are still not well understood, as interoperability is studied in silos. Consequently, choosing the proper IM for a use case is challenging. Our paper has three contributions: first, we systematically study the research area of DLT interoperability by dissecting and analyzing previous work. We study the logical separation of interoperability layers, how a DLT can connect to others (connection mode), the object of interoperation (interoperation mode), and propose a new categorization for IMs. Second, we propose the first interoperability assessment for DLTs that systematically evaluates the interoperability degree of an IM. This framework allows comparing the potentiality, compatibility, and performance among solutions. Finally, we propose two decision models to assist in choosing an IM, considering different requirements. The first decision model assists in choosing the infrastructure of an IM, while the second decision model assists in choosing its functionality.},

abstract = {The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) deployments have been growing manifold, encompassing sensors, networks, edge, fog, and cloud resources. Despite the intense interest from researchers and practitioners, most do not have access to large-scale IoT testbeds for validation. Simulation environments that allow analytical modeling are a poor substitute for evaluating software platforms or application workloads in realistic computing environments. Here, we propose a virtual environment for validating Internet of Things at large scales (VIoLET), an emulator for defining and launching large-scale IoT deployments within cloud VMs. It allows users to declaratively specify container-based compute resources that match the performance of native IoT compute devices using Docker. These can be inter-connected by complex topologies on which bandwidth and latency rules are enforced. Users can configure synthetic sensors for data generation as well. We also incorporate models for CPU resource dynamism, and for failure and recovery of the underlying devices. We offer a detailed comparison of VIoLET’s compute and network performance between the virtual and physical deployments, evaluate its scaling with deployments with up to 1, 000 devices and 4, 000 device-cores, and validate its ability to model resource dynamism. Our extensive experiments show that the performance of the virtual IoT environment accurately matches the expected behavior, with deviations levels within what is seen in actual physical devices. It also scales to 1, 000s of devices and at a modest cloud computing costs of under 0.15% of the actual hardware cost, per hour of use, with minimal management effort. This IoT emulation environment fills an essential gap between IoT simulators and real deployments.},
