  title       = {Digital twins of physical printing-imaging channel},
  abstract    = {In this paper, we address the problem of modeling a printing-imaging channel built on a machine learning approach a.k.a. digital twin for anti-counterfeiting applications based on copy detection patterns (CDP). The digital twin is formulated on an information-theoretic framework called Turbo that uses variational approximations of mutual information developed for both encoder and decoder in a two-directional information passage. The proposed model generalizes several state-of-the-art architectures such as adversarial autoencoder (AAE), CycleGAN and adversarial latent space autoencoder (ALAE). This model can be applied to any type of printing and imaging and it only requires training data consisting of digital templates or artworks that are sent to a printing device and data acquired by an imaging device. Moreover, these data can be paired, unpaired or hybrid paired-unpaired which makes the proposed architecture very flexible and scalable to many practical setups. We demonstrate the impact of various architectural factors, metrics and discriminators on the overall system performance in the task of generation/prediction of printed CDP from their digital counterparts and vice versa. We also compare the proposed system with several state-of-the-art methods used for image-to-image translation applications.},

  title       = {A White-Box Adversarial Attack Against a Digital Twin},
  abstract    = {Recent research has shown that Machine Learning/Deep Learning (ML/DL) models are particularly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small changes made to the input data in order to fool a machine learning classifier. The Digital Twin, which is typically described as consisting of a physical entity, a virtual counterpart, and the data connections in between, is increasingly being investigated as a means of improving the performance of physical entities by leveraging computational techniques, which are enabled by the virtual counterpart. This paper explores the susceptibility of Digital Twin (DT), a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object using ML/DL classifiers that operate as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), to adversarial attacks. As a proof of concept, we first formulate a DT of a vehicular system using a deep neural network architecture and then utilize it to launch an adversarial attack. We attack the DT model by perturbing the input to the trained model and show how easily the model can be broken with white-box attacks.},

Recent studies discuss the possibility of using digital twins for intrusion detection in industrial systems. Accordingly, this study contributes to a digital twin-based security framework for industrial control systems, extending its capabilities for simulation of attacks and defense mechanisms. Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection, based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1-Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds). This study also discusses the practicality and benefits of the proposed digital twin-based security framework.},

  title       = {Smart Grid: Cyber Attacks, Critical Defense Approaches, and Digital Twin},
  abstract    = {As a national critical infrastructure, the smart grid has attracted widespread attention for its cybersecurity issues. The development towards an intelligent, digital, and Internetconnected smart grid has attracted external adversaries for malicious activities. It is necessary to enhance its cybersecurity by either improving the existing defense approaches or introducing novel developed technologies to the smart grid context. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) is considered as an enabler for enhanced security. However, the practical implementation is quite challenging. This is due to the knowledge barriers among smart grid designers, security experts, and DT developers. Each single domain is a complicated system covering various components and technologies. As a result, works are needed to sort out relevant contents so that DT can be better embedded in the security architecture design of smart grid. In order to meet this demand, our paper covers the above three domains, i.e., smart grid, cybersecurity, and DT. Specifically, the paper i) introduces the background of the smart grid; ii) reviews external cyber attacks from attack incidents and attack methods; iii) introduces critical defense approaches in industrial cyber systems, which include device identification, vulnerability discovery, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), honeypots, attribution, and threat intelligence (TI); iv) reviews the relevant content of DT, including its basic concepts, applications in the smart grid, and how DT enhances the security. In the end, the paper puts forward our security considerations on the future development of DT-based smart grid. The survey is expected to help developers break knowledge barriers among smart grid, cybersecurity, and DT, and provide guidelines for future security design of DT-based smart grid.},

  title       = {Digital Twin for Secure Semiconductor Lifecycle Management: Prospects and Applications},
  abstract    = {The expansive globalization of the semiconductor supply chain has introduced numerous untrusted entities into different stages of a device's lifecycle. To make matters worse, the increase complexity in the design as well as aggressive time to market requirements of the newer generation of integrated circuits can lead either designers to unintentionally introduce security vulnerabilities or verification engineers to fail in detecting them earlier in the design lifecycle. These overlooked or undetected vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious entities in subsequent stages of the lifecycle through an ever widening variety of hardware attacks. The ability to ascertain the provenance of these vulnerabilities, therefore, becomes a pressing issue when the security assurance across the whole lifecycle is required to be ensured. We posit that if there is a malicious or unintentional breach of security policies of a device, it will be reflected in the form of anomalies in the traditional design, verification and testing activities throughout the lifecycle. With that, a digital simulacrum of a device's lifecycle, called a digital twin (DT), can be formed by the data gathered from different stages to secure the lifecycle of the device. In this paper, we put forward a realization of intertwined relationships of security vulnerabilities with data available from the silicon lifecycle and formulate different components of an AI driven DT framework. The proposed DT framework leverages these relationships and relational learning to achieve Forward and Backward Trust Analysis functionalities enabling security aware management of the entire lifecycle. Finally, we provide potential future research avenues and challenges for realization of the digital twin framework to enable secure semiconductor lifecycle management.},

We discuss the moment of the DT framework in facilitating implementation of network-based control processes and its implications for critical infrastructure. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.},

The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm has opened up new opportunities for privacy-preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper we present privacy related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats.

  abstract    = {The complexity of cyberattacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) calls for a mechanism that can evaluate critical infrastructures' operational behaviour and security without affecting the operation of live systems. In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including system testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security testing, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle. However, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envisions a blockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical Systems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework in a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through integrity checking mechanisms. Additionally, the safety and security rules evaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain, thereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by the underlying systems.

For this reason, the number of such systems is increasing dramatically, and therefore requires an adequate overview. To the best of our knowledge, no current systematic review of existing ITS solutions exists. To fill this knowledge gap, our paper provides an overview of existing ITS that use external infrastructure worldwide. Accordingly, this paper addresses current questions and challenges. For this purpose, we performed a literature review of documents that describe existing ITS solutions from 2009 until today. We categorized the results according to technology levels and analyzed its hardware system setup and value-added contributions. In doing so, we made the ITS solutions comparable and highlighted past development alongside current trends. We analyzed more than 357 papers, including 52 test bed projects. In summary, current ITSs can deliver accurate information about individuals in traffic situations in real-time. However, further research into ITS should focus on more reliable perception of the traffic using modern sensors, plug-and-play mechanisms, and secure real-time distribution of the digital twins in a decentralized manner. By addressing these topics, the development of intelligent transportation systems will be able to take a step towards its comprehensive roll-out.},

  abstract    = {Cyber-Physical systems (CPS) have complex lifecycles involving multiple stakeholders, and the transparency of both hardware and software components' supply chain is opaque at best. This raises concerns for stakeholders who may not trust that what they receive is what was requested. There is an opportunity to build a cyberphysical titling process offering universal traceability and the ability to differentiate systems based on provenance. Today, RFID tags and barcodes address some of these needs, though they are easily manipulated due to non-linkage with an object or system's intrinsic characteristics. We propose cyberphysical sequencing as a low-cost, light-weight and pervasive means of adding track-and-trace capabilities to any asset that ties a system's physical identity to a unique and invariant digital identifier. CPS sequencing offers benefits similar Digital Twins' for identifying and managing the provenance and identity of an asset throughout its life with far fewer computational and other resources.},

  title       = {Hierarchical Federated Learning based Anomaly Detection using Digital Twins for Smart Healthcare},
  abstract    = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FedTimeDis) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.},

  title       = {Towards Blockchain-enabled Open Architectures for Scalable Digital Asset Platforms},
  abstract    = {Today there is considerable interest in deploying blockchains and decentralized ledger technology as a means to address the deficiencies of current financial and digital asset infrastructures. The focal point of attention in many projects on digital asset and cryptocurrency is centered around blockchain systems and smart contracts. Many projects seek to make the blockchain as the centerpiece of the new decentralized world of finance. However, several roadblocks and challenges currently face this predominant blockchain-centric view. In this paper we argue that the proper and correct perspective on decentralized economy should be one that is asset-centric, where the goal should be the consistent lifecycle management of assets in the real-world with their digital representation on the blockchain. We introduce the notion of the digital twin to capture the relationship between a real-world asset and its on-chain representation. A digital twin container is utilized to permit off-chain state persistence and on-chain state traceability, where the container can be deployed on the blockchain as well as on traditional application servers. The digital twin container becomes the bridge between legacy infrastructures and the newly emergent blockchain infrastructures, permitting legacy systems to interoperate consistently with blockchain systems. We believe this asset-centric view to be the correct evolutionary direction for the nascent field of blockchains and decentralized ledger technology.},

  abstract    = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing industry currently being integrated into both consumer and industrial environments on a wide scale. While the technology is available and deployment has a low barrier of entry in future applications, proper security frameworks are still at infancy stage and are being developed to fit varied implementations and device architectures. Further, the need for edge centric mechanisms are critical to offer security in real time smart connected applications with minimal or negligible overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of data security by using multiple device shadows (aka digital twins) for a single physical object. These twins are paramount to separate data among different virtual objects based on tags assigned on-the-fly, and are used to limit access to different data points by authorized users/applications only. The novelty of the proposed architecture resides in the attachment of dynamic tags to key-value pairs reported by physical devices in the system. We further examine the advantages of tagging data in a digital twin system, and the performance impacts of the proposed data separation scheme. The proposed solution is deployed at the edge, supporting low latency and real time security mechanisms with minimal overhead, and is light-weight as reflected by captured performance metrics.},

Our model can be instantiated in various scenarios and we have in particular considered the popular case of food traceability. In contrast to weaker models known in the literature that propose their own ad-hoc properties to assess the robustness of their supply chain management systems, in this work we use the formalism of secure computation, where processes are described through generic and natural ideal functionalities.},

These functionalities require the integration of information and communication technologies that not only allow for a plethora of on-the-fly configuration abilities, but also provide a huge surface for attacks. Theses circumstances have also been recognized by standardization and regulation bodies, making the need for not only proper cybersecurity engineering but also proving the effectiveness of security measures by verification and validation through testing also a formal necessity. In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques. The approach is intended to generate meaningful attack vectors on a system with next-to-zero a priori knowledge.},

In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) are revolutionizing the CPSs. DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle, while assuming that the DT data is trusted, providing agility to predict and respond to real-time changes. However, existing DTs solutions in CPS are constrained with untrustworthy data dissemination among multiple stakeholders and timely course correction. Such limitations reinforce the significance of designing trustworthy distributed solutions with the ability to create actionable insights in real-time. To do so, we propose a framework that focuses on trusted and intelligent DT by integrating blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Following a hybrid approach, the proposed framework not only acquires process knowledge from the specifications of the CPS, but also relies on AI to learn security threats based on sensor data. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain to safeguard product lifecycle data. We discuss the applicability of the proposed framework for the automotive industry as a CPS use case. Finally, we identify the open challenges that impede the implementation of intelligence-driven architectures in CPSs.},

Simple, yet powerful methods such as bar- and QR-codes have been highly successful, e.g. in the retail space, but the lack of security, limited information content and impossibility of seamless integration with the environment have prevented a large-scale linking of physical objects to their digital twins. This paper proposes to link digital assets created through BIM with their physical counterparts using fiducial markers with patterns defined by Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs), selective retroreflectors produced using liquid crystal self-assembly. The markers leverage the ability of CSRs to encode information that is easily detected and read with computer vision while remaining practically invisible to the human eye. We analyze the potential of a CSR-based infrastructure from the perspective of BIM, critically reviewing the outstanding challenges in applying this new class of functional materials, and we discuss extended opportunities arising in assisting autonomous mobile robots to reliably navigate human-populated environments, as well as in augmented reality.},

Smart grid security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to provide its users a platform to train and test cyber attacks, in a safe and controlled environment.

To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on smart grids.

The difference from the physical test-bed is that its users may easily modify their power system components and configurations. Further, reproducing the twin for using and advancing the research is significantly cheaper. The developed twin has advanced features compared to any equivalent system in the literature.

The evaluation of a CDT is conducted continuously integrating new checks derived from new security requirements and from newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

However, cyber attacks against ICS - especially at the communication channels between humanmachine interface (HMIs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) - are increasing at a rate which outstrips the rate of mitigation. In this paper, we introduce a vendor-agnostic analytics framework which allows security researchers to analyse attacks against ICS systems, even if the researchers have zero control automation domain knowledge or are faced with a myriad of heterogenous ICS systems. Unlike existing works that require expertise in domain knowledge and specialised tool usage, our analytics framework does not require prior knowledge about ICS communication protocols, PLCs, and expertise of any network penetration testing tool. Using `digital twin' scenarios comprising industry-representative HMIs, PLCs and firewalls in our test lab, our framework's steps were demonstrated to successfully implement a stealthy deception attack based on false data injection attacks (FDIA). Furthermore, our framework also demonstrated the relative ease of attack dataset collection, and the ability to leverage well-known penetration testing tools. We also introduce the concept of `heuristic inference attacks', a new family of attack types on ICS which is agnostic to PLC and HMI brands/models commonly deployed in ICS. Our experiments were also validated on a separate ICS dataset collected from a cyber-physical scenario of water utilities. Finally, we utilized time complexity theory to estimate the difficulty for the attacker to conduct the proposed packet analyses, and recommended countermeasures based on our findings.},

The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users, hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this paper, we introduce the Digital Twin Wireless Networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system, and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multi-agent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning method.},

  title       = {Digital Twins: State of the Art Theory and Practice, Challenges, and Open Research Questions},
  abstract    = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time monitoring, simulation and forecasting. However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twins (DT) are still far from this vision. Although successful implementations exist, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, therefore it is difficult to assess their effectiveness, draw comparisons and jointly advance the DT methodology. This work explores the various DT features and current approaches, the shortcomings and reasons behind the delay in the implementation and adoption of digital twin. Advancements in machine learning, internet of things and big data have contributed hugely to the improvements in DT with regards to its real-time monitoring and forecasting properties. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research gaps exist in the field, which have caused delay in the widespread adoption of this concept. We reviewed relevant works and identified that the major reasons for this delay are the lack of a universal reference framework, domain dependence, security concerns of shared data, reliance of digital twin on other technologies, and lack of quantitative metrics. We define the necessary components of a digital twin required for a universal reference framework, which also validate its uniqueness as a concept compared to similar concepts like simulation, autonomous systems, etc. This work further assesses the digital twin applications in different domains and the current state of machine learning and big data in it. It thus answers and identifies novel research questions, both of which will help to better understand and advance the theory and practice of digital twins.},

  title       = {Trustworthy Digital Twins in the Industrial Internet of Things with Blockchain},
  abstract    = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for critical decision-making processes. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the trustworthiness of data. To this end, we envision a blockchain-based framework for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to address the issues of data management and security. Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, we leverage Digital Twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs.},

  title       = {Intrusion Detection in Binary Process Data: Introducing the Hamming-distance to Matrix Profiles},
  abstract    = {The digitisation of industry provides a plethora of novel applications that increase flexibility and reduce setup and maintenance time as well as cost. Furthermore, novel use cases are created by the digitisation of industry, commonly known as Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things, applications make use of communication and computation technology that is becoming available. This enables novel business use cases, such as the digital twin, customer individual production, and data market places. However, the inter-connectivity such use cases rely on also significantly increases the attack surface of industrial enterprises. Sabotage and espionage are aimed at data, which is becoming the most crucial asset of an enterprise. Since the requirements on security solutions in industrial networks are inherently different from office networks, novel approaches for intrusion detection need to be developed. In this work, process data of a real water treatment process that contains attacks is analysed. Analysis is performed by an extension of Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series. By extending Matrix Profiles with a Hammingdistance metric, binary and tertiary actuators can be integrated into the analysis in a meaningful fashion. This algorithm requires low training effort while providing accurate results. Furthermore, it can be employed in a real-time fashion. Selected actuators in the data set are analysed to highlight the applicability of the extended Matrix Profiles.},

  title       = {Simulation-Based Digital Twin Development for Blockchain Enabled End-to-End Industrial Hemp Supply Chain Risk Management},
  abstract    = {With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including: high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, lack of data and information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a stochastic simulation-based digital twin for IHSC risk management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.},

  title       = {Graph Layer Security: Encrypting Information via Common Networked Physics},
  abstract    = {The proliferation of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a race between wireless security and channel attacks. Traditional cryptography requires high-computational power and is not suitable for low-power IoT scenarios. Whist, recently developed physical layer security (PLS) can exploit common wireless channel state information (CSI), its sensitivity to channel estimation makes them vulnerable from attacks. In this work, we exploit an alternative common physics shared between IoT transceivers: the monitored channel-irrelevant physical networked dynamics (e.g., water/oil/gas/electrical signal-flows). Leveraging this, we propose for the first time, graph layer security (GLS), by exploiting the dependency in physical dynamics among network nodes for information encryption and decryption. A graph Fourier transform (GFT) operator is used to characterize such dependency into a graph-bandlimted subspace, which allows the generations of channel-irrelevant cipher keys by maximizing the secrecy rate. We evaluate our GLS against designed active and passive attackers, using IEEE 39-Bus system. Results demonstrate that, GLS is not reliant on wireless CSI, and can combat attackers that have partial networked dynamic knowledge (realistic access to full dynamic and critical nodes remains challenging). We believe this novel GLS has widespread applicability in secure health monitoring and for Digital Twins in adversarial radio environments.},
