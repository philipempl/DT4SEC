Abstract = {The digital twin is a rather new industrial control and automation
   systems concept. While the approach so far has gained interest mainly
   due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations,
   recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention
   within the research community. In this article, we discuss how a digital
   twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be
   used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes.
   We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based
   data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state
   synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization
   requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other
   security components of the architecture. We also make performance
   evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using
   the proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides a
   foundation for future research work in this promising new area.},

Abstract = {Industry 4.0 is having an increasingly positive impact on the value
   chain by modernizing and optimizing the production and distribution
   processes. In this streamline, the digital twin (DT) is one of the most
   cutting-edge technologies of Industry 4.0, providing simulation
   capabilities to forecast, optimize and estimate states and
   configurations. In turn, these technological capabilities are
   encouraging industrial stakeholders to invest in the new paradigm,
   though an increased focus on the risks involved is really needed. More
   precisely, the deployment of a DT is based on the composition of
   technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of
   Things, edge computing, virtualization infrastructures, artificial
   intelligence and big data. However, the confluence of all these
   technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart
   of the DT in the real world generate multiple security threats that have
   not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes
   the current state of the DT paradigm and classifies the potential
   threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality
   layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more
   complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of
   security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the
   appropriate and trustworthy use of a DT.},

   Twin},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {472-485},
Abstract = {In the digital twin environment, the fusion data onto physical entities
   in the physical space are mapped to multiple virtual spaces for digital
   modeling and intelligent simulation in different dimensions. In real
   intelligent manufacturing scenarios, heterogeneous multi-source fusion
   data are collected at the same time period. So they are consistent in
   time state. For the autonomous digital twin system, time states
   verification and integrity checking are basic security factors. Provable
   data possession technology can check the integrity of data onto virtual
   spaces. The blockchain can provide the synchronization interface to make
   distributed entities to obtain the trusted time state value. Considering
   the privacy, the blockchain can also provide anonymous services for
   entities. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based synchronized
   provable data possession scheme (named BSPDP) for digital twin. In our
   scheme, the selection of verifier is flexible. Since virtual spaces may
   be maliciously framed to pay compensation, we use tag verification to
   prevent honest virtual spaces from being framed. Under the assumption of
   RSA, the proposed BSPDP is provably secure. Finally, the performance
   analysis demonstrates that BSPDP is practical. The experimental results
   show that BSPDP is effective and attractive for digital twin.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin is a way to virtually represent or model a physical object
   using the real time data. This innovation sets up a way to deal with
   industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently
   bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name
   suggests, ``Digital Twin{''} infers that a reproduction of the product
   is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The
   procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data,
   processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive
   investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally
   enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their
   product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering
   information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could
   store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the
   intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the
   successful working of the products geographically distributed. The
   impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital
   twin.
   The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of
   utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as
   they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use.
   Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of
   manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The
   effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for
   activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach
   can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the
   virtual machine without the need of a specific training.
   With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial
   Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent
   approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own
   execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing
   self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded
   with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the
   field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital
   twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the
   data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting,
   organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data
   is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud.
   It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud
   which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and
   process it effectively.},

Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on communication and control
   technologies to efficiently manage devices in the system. However, a
   wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the
   evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into
   integrated networks, including smart grid (SG). SG security studies are
   carried out on physical test-beds to train and test cyber attacks in a
   safe/controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying
   physical configuration and scalability. To overcome these shortcomings,
   we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for
   cyber security studies on SGs. The twin enable users to deploy real
   world attacks and countermeasures, and study its effectiveness. In the
   twin users may easily modify the components and configurations unlike in
   a physical test-bed. Further, reproducing the twin for advancing the
   research is significantly cheaper. We illustrate the typical use case
   with an example case study.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin
   is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect
   physical components with digital space for better optimization of
   physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security
   concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this
   article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge
   networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin
   construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an
   access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing
   digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network
   operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging
   directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model
   updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to
   help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and
   also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update
   verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint
   cooperative federated learning and local model update verification
   scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and
   local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare.
   Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in
   digital twin construction.},

Abstract = {Emerging digital twin (DT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC) are crucial
   for enabling the rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works
   ignore the edge collaboration, which can provide the system with
   additional performance gain. In this article, we study the problem of
   mobile users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative
   mobile-edge servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a
   DT-assisted task offloading scheme (DTTOS) that consists of the
   selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel
   state information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the
   selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU's task
   offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an
   intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at
   decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the
   complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved
   by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep-Q-learning (DDQN),
   respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the
   proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network
   performance improvement.},

Title = {A Blockchain Based System for Healthcare Digital Twin},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {50523-50547},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that replicates any physical
   phenomenon from a physical space to a digital space in congruence with
   the physical state. However, devising a Healthcare DT model for patient
   care is seen as a challenging task as the lack of adequate data
   collection structure. There are also security and privacy concerns as
   healthcare data is very sensitive and can be used in malicious ways.
   Because of these current research gaps, the proper way of acquiring the
   structured data and managing them in a secure way is very important. In
   this article, we present a mathematical data model to accumulate the
   patient relevant data in a structured and predefined way with proper
   delineation. Additionally, the provided data model is described in
   harmony with real life contexts. Then, we have used the patient centric
   mathematical data model to formally define the semantic and scope of our
   proposed Healthcare Digital Twin (HDT) system based on Blockchain.
   Accordingly, the proposed system is described with all the key
   components as well as with detailed protocol flows and an analysis of
   its different aspects. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model
   with a critical comparison with other relevant research works have been
   provided.},

Title = {Digital Twin-Based Safety Risk Coupling of Prefabricated Building
   Hoisting},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Safety management in hoisting is the key issue to determine the
   development of prefabricated building construction. However, the
   security management in the hoisting stage lacks a truly effective method
   of information physical fusion, and the safety risk analysis of hoisting
   does not consider the interaction of risk factors. In this paper, a
   hoisting safety risk management framework based on digital twin (DT) is
   presented. The digital twin hoisting safety risk coupling model is
   built. The proposed model integrates the Internet of Things (IoT),
   Building Information Modeling (BIM), and a security risk analysis method
   combining the Apriori algorithm and complex network. The real-time
   perception and virtual-real interaction of multi-source information in
   the hoisting process are realized, the association rules and coupling
   relationship among hoisting safety risk factors are mined, and the
   time-varying data information is visualized. Demonstration in the
   construction of a large-scale prefabricated building shows that with the
   proposed framework, it is possible to complete the information fusion
   between the hoisting site and the virtual model and realize the visual
   management. The correlative relationship among hoisting construction
   safety risk factors is analyzed, and the key control factors are found.
   Moreover, the efficiency of information integration and sharing is
   improved, the gap of coupling analysis of security risk factors is
   filled, and effective security management and decision-making are
   achieved with the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date
   virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in
   most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize
   the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use
   of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the
   dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a
   Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360 degrees camera
   and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The
   Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by
   constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360
   degrees live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature
   and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other
   purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using
   a 360 degrees web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object
   detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured
   stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an
   identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the
   corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these
   objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost
   importance to many other services and domains such as national security.
   To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and
   conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection
   and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness
   of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step
   forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart
   mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.},

Abstract = {5G networks require dynamic network monitoring and advanced security
   solutions. This work performs the essential steps to implement a basic
   5G digital twin (DT) in a warehouse scenario. This study provides a
   paradigm of end-to-end connection and encryption to internet of things
   (IoT) devices. Network function virtualization (NFV) technologies are
   crucial to connecting and encrypting IoT devices. Innovative logistical
   scenarios are undergoing constant changes in logistics, and higher
   deployment of IoT devices in logistic scenarios, such as warehouses,
   demands better communication capabilities. The simulation tools enable
   digital twin network implementation in planning. Altair Feko (WinProp)
   simulates the radio behavior of a typical warehouse framework. The radio
   behavior can be exported as a radio simulation dataset file. This
   dataset file represents the virtual network's payload. GNS3, an
   open-source network simulator, performs data payload transmission among
   clients to servers using custom NFV components. By transmitting data
   from client to server, we achieved end-to-end communication.
   Additionally, custom NFV components enable advanced encryption standard
   (AES) adoption. In summary, this work analyzes the round-trip time (RTT)
   and throughput of the payload data packages, in which two data packages,
   encrypted and non-encrypted, are observed.},

Abstract = {Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,
   and makes application of technologies and advanced data processing
   techniques in agricultural field possible. Digital farming aims to use
   available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing
   challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and
   resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex,
   dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital
   approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further
   decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual
   representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity
   and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review
   describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with
   different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts.
   It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,
   robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in
   agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial
   intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and
   communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies)
   of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can
   support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by
   continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and
   updating the state of virtual world.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of digital twin technology, a large amount of
   digital twin data named as big digital twin data (BDTD), is generated in
   the lifecycle of equipment, which is supposed to be used in digital twin
   enabled applications. However, in the implementation of these
   applications, data sharing problem which is caused by the lack of data
   security as well as trust among stakeholders of equipment, limits data
   using value. It is a novel way to introduce blockchain technology into
   digital twin to solve the problem. However, current methods cannot
   fulfill the requirements of exponential growth and timely sharing of
   BDTD. Therefore, a blockchain-based framework for secure sharing of BDTD
   is proposed to solve the problems. Cloud storage is integrated into the
   framework, with which, BDTD is encrypted and stored in Cloud, while the
   hash of BDTD and transaction records are stored in blockchain. Some
   rules of generating new block are designed to improve the processing
   speed of blockchain. An algorithm for optimal sampling rate selection is
   presented to maximize total social benefits of the participants of BDTD
   sharing. Simulation results show that the algorithm is better than
   traditional method for maximizing the total social benefits.
   Furthermore, a protype system is developed and evaluated based on Fabric
   test network. Evaluation results show that BDTD can be shared securely
   multiple times per second through the framework, which demonstrates the
   feasibility of the framework in supporting timely sharing of BDTD.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art digital
   twin and digital thread technology in industrial operations. Both are
   transformational technologies that have the advantage of improving the
   efficiency of current design and manufacturing. Digital twin is an
   important element of the Industry 4.0 digitalization process; however,
   the huge amount of data that are generated and collected by a digital
   twin offer challenges in handling, processing and storage. The paper
   aims to report on the development of a new framework that combines the
   digital twin and digital thread for better data management in order to
   drive innovation, improve the production process and performance and
   ensure continuity and traceability of information. The digital
   twin/thread framework incorporates behavior simulation and physical
   control components, in which these two components rely on the
   connectivity between the twin and thread for information flow and
   exchange to drive innovation. The twin/thread framework encompasses
   specifications that include organizational architecture layout,
   security, user access, databases and hardware and software requirements.
   It is envisaged that the framework will be applicable to enhancing the
   optimization of operational processes and traceability of information in
   the physical world, especially in an Industry Shipyard 4.0.},

Title = {Cyber Resilience in Healthcare Digital Twin on Lung Cancer},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {201900-201913},
Abstract = {As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is
   the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and
   provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support
   healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and
   policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience.
   Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience
   in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been
   applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in
   vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code
   context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related
   keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins.
   Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a
   full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience
   check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme
   for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare
   digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture
   bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A
   number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground
   truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and
   non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our
   new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for
   vulnerability detection.},

Title = {Atikokan Digital Twin: Machine learning in a biomass energy system},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {310},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The Atikokan Generating Station, operated by Ontario Power Generation,
   has a 200 MW, biomass-fired tower boiler that operates on a dispatch
   schedule with a five-minute cycle. The boiler is generally operated in
   the range of 40-100 MW using two of five burner levels. In order to
   optimize boiler performance, we propose the implementation of a unique
   digital twin. Our digital twin abstraction couples Bayesian inference
   from science based models and from observations (machine learning) with
   decision theory to predict operating-variable set points that optimize
   the physical asset (the boiler) in the presence of uncertainty
   (artificial intelligence). We focus this paper on the continuous
   Bayesian machine learning part of the Atikokan Digital Twin; we discuss
   decision theory in a companion paper. We identify and learn about 12
   operational, model, and measured-output parameters and their
   uncertainties from high-fidelity, science-based simulations of the
   Atikokan boiler and from the observed measurements at the power plant.
   Since the goal of the Atikokan Digital Twin is to implement it online in
   real time, we require fast function evaluations for the quantities of
   interest extracted from the simulations in the Bayesian analysis. We use
   Gaussian process regression/interpolation to create accurate, robust
   surrogate models. We define the Bayesian priors and likelihood function
   and solve for the posterior distributions of the 12 parameters. We then
   propagate these distributions (i.e., parameters with uncertainty) into
   the predicted distributions of 790 quantities of interest to learn about
   the relative importance of various sources of error including
   experimental, model, and operating-parameter errors.},

Abstract = {Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure
   efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the
   airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming
   increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including
   the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries,
   weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air
   cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan
   optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality
   system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for
   connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical
   operations and virtual space. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment
   (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment
   with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor
   data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal
   cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the
   digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal,
   especially the allocation of dangerous goods and special cargo. Load
   planners can master complex air cargo load planning through the system
   with optimal solutions generated. The operations of cargo assembly and
   security screening with digital twins could be further developed for
   future development.},

Abstract = {The trend of digitalization has produced rapidly increasing data
   interaction and authentication demand in today's Internet of things
   ecosystem. To face the challenge, we demonstrated a micro-scale label by
   direct laser writing to perform as a passport between the physical and
   digital worlds. On this label, the user information is encrypted into
   three-dimensional geometric structures by a tensor network and then
   authenticated through the decryption system based on computer vision. A
   two-step printing methodology is applied to code the randomly
   distributed fluorescence from doped quantum dots, which achieved
   physical unclonable functions (PUFs) of the passport. The 10(5)
   bits/mm(2) data storage density enables abundant encrypted information
   from physical worlds, for example, the biometric data of human users.
   This passport guarantees the strong correlation between the user's
   privacy data and the PUF-assisted codes, successfully overcoming the
   illegal transfer of authentication information. Due to its ultra-high
   security level and convenience, the printed passport has enormous
   potential in future digital twin authentication anytime anywhere,
   including personal identity, valuable certificates, and car networking.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To ensure food security, agricultural production systems should innovate
   in the direction of increasing production while reducing utilized
   resources. Due to the higher level of automation with respect to
   traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture
   (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at
   the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin
   (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the
   productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource
   consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is
   introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its
   validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize
   productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the
   optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control
   of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management.
   Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the
   authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies
   for improving the productivity of CEA systems.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G)
   mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence
   in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin
   and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust
   instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy,
   federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for
   deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks.
   However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack
   of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated
   learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin
   wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless
   networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the
   edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning
   framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which
   improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data
   privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the
   proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge
   association by jointly considering digital twin association, training
   data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent
   reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem.
   Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme
   yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark

Abstract = {Due to the installation of various apparatus in process industries, both
   factors of complex structures and severe operating conditions could
   result in higher accident frequencies and maintenance challenges. Given
   the importance of security in process systems, this paper presents a
   data-driven digital twin system for automatic process applications by
   integrating virtual modeling, process monitoring, diagnosis, and
   optimized control into a cooperative architecture. For unknown model
   parameters, the adaptive system identification is proposed to model
   closed-loop virtual systems and residual signals with fault-free case
   data. Performance indices are improved to make the design of robust
   monitoring and diagnosis system to identify the apparatus status.
   Soft-sensor, parameterization control, and model-matching
   reconfiguration are ameliorated and incorporated into the optimized
   control configuration to guarantee stable and safe control performance
   under apparatus faults. The effectiveness and performance of the
   proposed digital twin system are evaluated by using different
   simulations on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process in the presence
   of realistic fault scenarios. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Implementation},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs), with their
   associated communication and control complexities, there is a need for
   an efficient platform that can digest all the incoming data and ensure
   the reliable operation of the power system. The digital twin (DT) is a
   new concept that can unleash tremendous opportunities and can be used at
   the different control and security levels of power systems. This paper
   provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy
   cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple
   applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth
   and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision
   making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using
   Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical
   and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from
   the different actual power and control entities. The experimental
   results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of
   the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud
   computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the
   low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7\%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the
   proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the
   voltage estimates, with 98.2\% accuracy from only the controllers'
   states.},

Title = {ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {107574-107588},
Abstract = {The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern
   regarding the development of security monitoring and management
   mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in
   ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not
   easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the
   natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions
   implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical
   objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security
   analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed
   in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises
   deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return
   will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support
   infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data
   collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the
   acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to
   design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures,
   developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are
   built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic
   Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection
   processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning
   models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The
   validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of
   the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using
   cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the
   projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go
   OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS
   (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate
   that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins
   have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and
   Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of
   data are generated.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and
   next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid
   development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the
   increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and
   allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains
   a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on
   models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT
   networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In
   this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose
   the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical
   edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a
   blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen
   communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN.
   Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we
   propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin
   empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate
   spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm
   that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication
   efficiency and data security for IoT applications.},

   Finite Sets Based Approach},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security,
   there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of
   anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most
   outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in
   recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is
   the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the
   simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a
   paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically
   assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model
   guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin
   theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor
   control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for
   supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based
   data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the
   sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data
   association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of
   the reward function by using the results of the proposed
   data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control
   action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Title = {Digital twin oriented architecture for secure and QoS aware intelligent
   communications in industrial environments},
Journal = {PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {85},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In modern networking industrial environments, characterized by the
   integration of Operation Technology and Information Technology, there is
   a strong need to ensure both safety and security of operations and
   communications. In this regard, IEC 62443 zones and conduits represent
   powerful high-level abstractions stressing the impor-tance of clearly
   separating machines in relation to safety requirements and of clearly
   defining inter-machine communication security requirements. However,
   their actual implementation is still demanded to human-centric
   error-prone procedures performed by technicians directly on network
   elements, without any integrated plant-wide point of view. To overcome
   these issues, first of all we originally state the need of applying the
   Digital Twin approach to zones and conduits, making easier the
   definition and management of inter-machine security requirements. For
   instance, industrial technicians can specify that communication among
   two zones should always flows through a ciphered conduit with a given
   algorithm and key length, at the cost of increased latency. Secondly, we
   state the need of exploiting an intelligent reasoner to monitor the
   current state of the environment (represented by asset and network
   Digital Twins), actively reconfiguring them in case desired requirements
   are not satisfied. Then, the reasoner allows to enforce requirements
   while also considering the fulfillment of a proper trade-off between
   security and performance, e.g., by reducing the ciphering complexity to
   ensure prompt packet dispatching whenever required. Performance results
   based on our working prototype demonstrate the feasibility and
   efficiency of the proposed solution under stringent requirements typical
   of industrial environments. In particular, in terms of better
   flexibility we proved that our orchestrator is able to create a new
   Digital Twin in less than 2.5 s in a typical edge node with a medium
   load. In addition, proposed routing policies based on our machine
   learning reasoner led to the satisfaction of well-defined low latency
   requirements (250 ms) while avoiding packet dropping.(c) 2022 Elsevier

Title = {Prototyping a Digital Twin for Real Time Remote Control Over Mobile
   Networks: Application of Remote Surgery},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {20325-20336},
Abstract = {The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of
   future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry
   4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface
   description related to a product or process available through a single
   interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment.
   However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future
   application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for
   specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We
   developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of
   communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks
   supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high
   levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject
   for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised
   of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over
   a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the
   system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a
   network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and
   attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization
   within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is
   limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from
   the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could
   be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for
   communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies
   that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we
   concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development
   in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own
   tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a
   potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and
   similar concepts.},

Abstract = {Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as haptics,
   human-computer interaction, and extended reality, using the
   sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems have diverse requirements in
   terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance
   metrics. Therefore, enabling IoE applications over 6G requires a new
   framework that can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the 6G
   wireless system and its underlying IoE services. Such a new framework
   for 6G can be based on digital twins. Digital twins use a virtual
   representation of the 6G physical system along with the associated
   algorithms (e.g., machine learning, optimization), communication
   technologies (e.g., millimeter-wave and terahertz communication),
   computing systems (e.g., edge computing and cloud computing), as well as
   privacy and security-related technologists (e.g., blockchain). First, we
   present the key design requirements for enabling 6G through the use of a
   digital twin. Next, the architectural components and trends such as
   edge-based twins, cloud-based-twins, and edge-cloud-based twins are
   presented. Furthermore, we provide a comparative description of various
   twins. Finally, we outline and recommend guidelines for several future
   research directions.},

Title = {On the Design of a Privacy-Preserving Communication Scheme for
   Cloud-Based Digital Twin Environments Using Blockchain},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {75365-75375},
Abstract = {Digital twin technology is recently in the spotlight because of its
   potential applicability in business and industry. In digital twin
   environments, data generated from physical assets are transmitted to a
   remote server, which performs simulations through digital twins in a
   virtual space. Then, the simulation results can be shared with the data
   owner or other users. However, several challenges exist in the
   application of digital twin technology in the real world. One of the
   main challenges involves determining how to share real-time data for the
   simulation and how to share the simulation data securely. The data
   generated from physical assets may include sensitive information from
   data owners, and the leakage of data to an adversary can cause serious
   privacy problems. Moreover, the sharing of data with other data users
   should also be considered to maximize the availability of digital twin
   data. To resolve these issues, we propose a system model for the secure
   sharing of digital twin data. The proposed system model uses cloud
   computing for efficient data sharing and blockchain for data
   verifiability. We also propose communication schemes for the proposed
   model to guarantee privacy preservation and data security in wireless
   channels. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol using
   informal methods and formal methods such as BAN logic and the AVISPA
   simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare the proposed protocol with
   related protocols and demonstrate that the proposed scheme is applicable
   to digital twin environments.},

Abstract = {The increased rate of cyber-attacks on the power system necessitates the
   need for innovative solutions to ensure its resiliency. This work builds
   on the advancement in the IoT to provide a practical framework that is

   cyber-physical system that interacts with the control system to ensure
   its proper operation. The IoT cloud provision of the energy
   cyber-physical and the DT are mathematically formulated. Unlike other
   cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can
   mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is
   tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are
   implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are
   implemented using single-board computers. The practical results show
   that the proposed DT is able to mitigate the coordinated false data
   injection and the denial of service cyber-attacks.},

   SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the
   learning performance of deep Q-learning. SAINT supports access priority
   and energy consumption awareness due to the consideration of long-term

Abstract = {Urban digital twin (UDT) technology can be used to digitize physical
   urban spaces. Previous UDT or smart city research reconstructed the
   three-dimensional topography of urban spaces, buildings, and facilities.
   They collected various multimodal sensor data from cities and monitored
   conditions such as temperature, humidity, fine dust, and real-time road
   traffic. However, these studies lacked ways to manage individual
   mobility data, such as those of the vehicles and pedestrians, which
   constitute major components of a city. Here, we propose a geospatial
   platform based on the universal game engine Unity3D, which manages
   large-scale individual mobility data for a UDT platform. The proposed
   platform stores and manages individual vehicles or pedestrians using
   information from public closed-circuit television. It also allows the
   generation of long-term route information for a unique vehicle based on
   its license plate. We also propose methods to anonymize license plates,
   to ensure the security of individuals, and to compress individual
   mobility data. Unique UDT models with individual mobility

Abstract = {The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires
   industrial production towards digitalization to improve network
   efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the
   digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical
   objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very
   challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and
   resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be
   efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy
   consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article,
   we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network
   topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we
   formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation
   problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated
   problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov
   optimization technique to transform the original problem into a
   deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous
   actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation
   offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed
   scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.},

Abstract = {The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object,
   which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The
   DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle
   that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a
   production system and its components. A methodology design using
   model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being
   both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels:
   first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide
   basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication,
   security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and
   simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical
   composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on
   these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed
   using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that
   supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A
   case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated
   with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are
   described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify
   that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment
   process of a DT.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is a key enabling technology to realize cyber-physical
   system (CPS), which can truly perceive, map, and predict the operating
   state of physical entity. Through analyzing the generality of the
   testing process of large and complex equipment components (LCEC), a
   five-dimensional framework of DT-based test process management (DTTPM)
   is proposed, which comprises physical layer, network layer, data layer,
   model layer, and service layer. In order to realize the visualization
   and enhance the controllability, security, and information transparency
   of LCEC in the testing process, three key technologies are elaborated in
   detail as follows: (1) the construction of the twin semantic model of
   the testing process in model layer, (2) the synchronization method of
   twin model and physical entity based on real-time data, (3) and
   human-computer interaction-based visual monitoring of authenticity and
   safety coordination. Through the case of the vibration test for the
   crowned blade of a steam turbine by blade tip-timing measurement, the
   feasibility and flexibility of DTTPM are demonstrated.},

Title = {Data-driven hybrid petri-net based energy consumption behaviour
   modelling for digital twin of energy-efficient manufacturing system},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {239},
Number = {C},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Advances in energy-saving technology is main way to achieve carbon
   neutrality. With the development of digital twin, building the
   physical-virtual data space for improving energy management capacity of
   enterprises has received tremendous attention. The energy behaviour
   model implementing accurate simulation and prediction of energy state is
   the core meta-model of energy-efficient manufacturing digital twin
   (EMDT). The widely used state-based energy modelling assumes constant
   power in operation state and approximately fits the energy behaviour
   without considering uncertain operation environment, resulting in energy
   behaviour distortion. A data-driven hybrid petri-net (DDHPN) inspired by
   both the state-based energy modelling and machine learning was developed
   for establishing the energy behaviour meta-model. Gaussian kernel
   extreme learning machine is proposed to fit the instantaneous firing
   speed of energy consumption continuous transitions in DDHPN. DDHPN-based
   energy behaviour model is driven by physical data under real-time
   working conditions, operating parameters, and production load for
   generating a virtual data space of energy management. Finally, DDHPN was
   integrated into the EMDT model using unified modelling language. The
   application in extrusion process and die casting process show that the
   presented model has higher accuracy in energy behaviour prediction.
   Furthermore, a digital-twin-based energy management prototype system for
   extrusion workshop demonstrates its potential. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Real-time prediction method of fatigue life of bridge crane structure
   based on digital twin},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The comprehensive effect of multiple factors that include the geometric
   characteristics, load status, service characteristics, and failure
   mechanism will affect the safety of bridge crane structure. To evaluate
   the security of the bridge crane structure, the real-time prediction
   method of fatigue life of the bridge structure based on digital twin is
   proposed. The specific type of general bridge crane is selected as the
   physical entity of the research object, and the information acquisition
   system is utilized to get the current service status information about
   the physical entity. On this basis, combined with the historical service
   information and inherent information of physical entity, the fuzzy
   database is established. Meanwhile, twin data are formed by the clear
   quantification of fuzzy information and data processing technology. In
   accordance with structural characteristic and work cycle process of
   bridge crane, the analytical models of load, strength, defect, and
   fatigue life are established, respectively. The multi-theoretical
   calculation model is completed by encapsulating the analysis models and
   transmitting information, and then the main factors affecting the
   fatigue life of bridge crane structure are determined. With that, the
   comprehensive evaluation coefficient is calculated by the fuzzy
   comprehensive evaluation theory. The response relationship between the
   information data and the fatigue life of bridge crane structure is
   described by the Kriging surrogate model constructed with experimental
   design. Real-time prediction of fatigue life of bridge crane structure
   is realized in a virtual space to depict the life cycle process. Taking
   QD20/10 t x 43 m x 12 m general bridge crane as an example, the
   feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are verified, which
   provides a strong theoretical basis for dependable service and timely
   scrapping of cranes.},

   Decentralized Applications in the Built Environment},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) can enable distributed collaboration,
   enhance data sharing, and automate back-end processes for digital twin
   (DT) decentralized applications (dApps) in the construction industry
   (CI) 4.0. The aim of this paper was to propose a software architecture
   and to develop a framework of smart contracts for blockchain-based
   digital twin (BCDT) dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects in CI
   4.0. This paper leveraged the existing literature and action research
   interviews to identify and validate the critical industry problems,
   functional requirements (FRs), and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to
   be addressed by BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. Basic use cases were developed to
   design a framework of smart contracts for BCDT dApps throughout the
   lifecycle of projects. The analysis of an online survey was used to
   identify the key requirements and enablers to propose a software
   architecture for BCDT applications and to validate the requirements for
   developing the framework of a smart contract for BCDTs. The findings
   were: (1) The identification of key problems in CI 4.0 for each BIM/BCDT
   dimension (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, and contractual (cD)) and the related
   FRs and NFRs for BCDT applications. Additionally, key use cases were
   designed to address the problems identified. (2) The proposed BCDT
   architecture permitted us to narrow gaps in the literature on
   blockchain-based decentralized digital twins. Moreover, the proposed
   BCDT architecture and smart-contract framework addressed the main
   requirements in the literature on BCDTs. (3) The study leveraged the
   non-fungible token (NFT) standard to develop a framework for smart
   contracts that addressed the key use cases and the related industry
   problems and functional requirements that were identified. The study
   also considered the contractual dimension (cD) as an overarching
   dimension in relation to the other BCDT dimensions. (4) We also compared
   the costs of several public blockchains for executing the proposed
   smart-contract framework throughout the lifecycle of a medium-sized
   building project. The cost analysis permitted the development of
   criteria to evaluate the suitability of blockchain networks for BCDT
   applications in CI 4.0 depending on the principal blockchain networks'
   properties (security, decentralization, scalability, and
   interoperability). Finally, this study resulted in a novel framework
   that included software architecture, smart-contract use cases, and
   selection criteria among blockchain networks for BCDT dApps in CI 4.0.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Featured Application This work was elaborated in the frame of a
   collaborative innovation project named CyberFactory\#1 which aims at
   enhancing optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. Its
   outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial
   use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors
   such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication,
   consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is
   provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace
   System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is
   being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named
   Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing
   assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual
   assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their
   applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches
   are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and
   interdependencies between different production assets are commonly
   ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose
   innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash
   novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a
   holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented
   by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and
   simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including
   external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel
   approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for
   security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital
   Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of
   Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a
   specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System
   Manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Recently, the proposed Cybertwin-driven 6G network architecture has
   attracted attentions from academia, which can support the communication
   anchor, security agent and other functions for physical devices.
   Especially, Cybertwin can provide promising Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
   applications in future. However, security and privacy of Cybertwin still
   face various threats and challenges, which may impact future deployments
   for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. In this paper, we first introduce the
   architecture and promising applications of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X.
   Then, we analyze essential data security and privacy preservation
   requirements for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. Particularly, we present the
   security reference architecture of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. As a case
   study, we investigate the migration of Cybertwin caused by vehicle
   mobility, and propose a handover authentication scheme to create new
   Cybertwin between vehicle and edge server based on proxy ring signature
   technique. Finally, we discuss several open research directions for
   achieving more secure Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X.},

Abstract = {The Digital Twin concept promises numerous applications across
   industries and its physical twin's entire life cycle. Although numerous
   architectures have been proposed to develop and describe the setup of
   Digital Twin applications, current Digital Twin architectures do not
   address the versatile cross-industry character of the Digital Twin
   concept, its safety, security, and privacy aspects, and are often use
   case-specific and inflexible. We propose a three-dimensional Digital
   Twin reference architecture model for application across industries,
   considering functionality, dependability, and life cycle aspects. Our
   model provides practitioners a common platform to develop and discuss
   Digital Twin applications of different complexities and dependability
   aspects along varying life cycles and independent of the industry. Its
   applicability is validated and showcased by examples from the fields of
   mechatronic products, healthcare, construction, transportation,
   astronautics, and the energy sector. We compare our reference
   architecture model to existing architectures, discuss its advantages and
   limitations, and position the model within previous literature.},

Title = {Digital Twin to Detect Nuclear Proliferation: A Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},

Abstract = {This case study describes the development of technologies that enable
   digital-engineering and digital-twinning efforts in proliferation
   detection. The project presents a state-of-the-art approach to support
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards by incorporating
   diversion-pathway analysis, facility misuse, and the detection of
   indicators within the reactor core, applying the safeguards-by-design
   concept, and demonstrates its applicability as a sensitive monitoring
   system for advanced reactors and power plants. There are two pathways a
   proliferating state might take using the reactor core. One is
   ``diversion,{''} where special fissionable nuclear material-i.e.,
   Pu-239, U-233, U enriched in U-233/235-that has been declared to the
   IAEA is removed surreptitiously, either by taking small amounts of
   nuclear material over a long time (known as protracted diversion) or
   large amounts in a short time (known as abrupt diversion). The second
   pathway is ``misuse,{''} where undeclared source material-material that
   can be transmuted into special fissionable nuclear material: depleted
   uranium, natural uranium, and thorium-is placed in the core, where it
   uses the neutron flux for transmutation. Digital twinning and digital
   engineering have demonstrated significant performance improvement and
   schedule reduction in the aerospace, automotive, and construction
   industries. This integrated modeling approach has not been fully applied
   to nuclear safeguards programs in the past. Digital twinning, combined
   with machine learning technologies, can lead to new innovations in
   process-monitoring detection, specifically in event classification,
   real-time notification, and data tampering. It represents a
   technological leap in evaluation and detection capability to safeguard
   any nuclear facility.},

Abstract = {Digital twins (DT) have been proposed to support and enhance
   manufacturing processes of the industries. The outcome of adopting DT is
   so encouraging that it is hoped that more than 50\% of the large
   industries will benefit from DT by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, DT
   lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers
   for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated
   structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure
   and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain
   technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers
   from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum
   attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely
   twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction
   confirmation. This article also presents a framework for deployment of
   twinchain for manufacturing of a robot surgical machine.},

Abstract = {The rapid development and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
   in modern networks and Industry 4.0 have attracted substantial interest
   from cybersecurity researchers. In this study, we propose a
   software-defined framework that improves network intrusion detection
   systems by using manufacturer usage description (MUD) to enhance the
   behavioral monitoring in IoT networks. We aim to explore whether
   Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices typically serve a common role in
   cyber-physical systems, and their communications exhibit predictable
   patterns that can be defined in MUD profile(s) formally and succinctly.
   We design a framework that utilizes the concept of digital twins and
   software-defined networking to improve the security of IIoT
   environments. The MUD data are profiled, and the actions are evaluated
   on the network digital twin before they are used in the physical
   network. The behavioral profiling system is updated in real time,
   thereby improving the overall system security and compliance to policies
   in the IoT deployment. Evaluation results show that our solution
   outperforms existing approaches substantially in terms of attack
   detection accuracy, predicting security incidents, response time, and
   resource usage.},

Title = {Digital Twin for the Oil and Gas Industry: Overview, Research Trends,
   Opportunities, and Challenges},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {104175-104197},
Abstract = {With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O\&G) industry is
   now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity,
   efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and
   operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the
   O\&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows
   O\&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets.
   Considering DT adoption, the O\&G industry is still at an early stage
   with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications
   instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT
   implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related
   technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology,
   the current status of O\&G-related DT research activities, and the
   opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the
   O\&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this
   understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the
   context of the O\&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to
   select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based
   publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as
   Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered
   articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant
   Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and
   conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study.
   These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were
   thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology
   and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of
   DT deployment in the O\&G industry. From this literature review, it was
   found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle
   management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O\&G
   industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty
   in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O\&G
   industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT
   related research in the O\&G industry, the United States (US) is the
   leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China,
   Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall
   publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year
   until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The
   number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of
   conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented
   theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both
   these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O\&G
   industry is still at an early stage.},

Title = {Machine Learning Based Transient Stability Emulation and Dynamic System
   Equivalencing of Large-Scale AC-DC Grids for Faster-Than-Real-Time
   Digital Twin},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {112975-112988},
Abstract = {Modern power systems have been expanding significantly including the
   integration of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, bringing a
   tremendous computational challenge to transient stability simulation for
   dynamic security assessment (DSA). In this work, a practical method for
   energy control center with the machine learning (ML) based synchronous
   generator model (SGM) and dynamic equivalent model (DEM) is proposed to
   reduce the computational burden of the traditional transient stability
   (TS) simulation. The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field
   programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT)
   digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated
   Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM,
   where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line
   simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT (R). A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg
   500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established
   for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation
   platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid,
   multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is
   also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the
   hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT
   ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it
   reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of
   AC-DC grid.},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the popularization of computer and information
   network technology, the core business of more and more industries has
   basically realized informatization office. Although the informatization
   office has brought a lot of convenience to people, the increasingly
   complex informatization infrastructure equipment has also buried many
   hidden dangers for people. More and more security incidents are caused
   by unfamiliarity with these infrastructures. How to use the information
   infrastructure correctly has become a problem considered by more and
   more enterprise information security departments, and the position of IT
   operation and maintenance is born to solve this hidden danger. The IT
   (Internet Technology) operation and maintenance personnel of each
   enterprise formulate a set of operational risk quantitative assessment
   models for the enterprise based on the internal information
   infrastructure equipment of the enterprise so that the enterprise staff
   can use these infrastructure equipment efficiently and safely. This
   paper focused on the quantitative assessment model of IT operation and
   maintenance operation risk constructed by the digital twin model. The
   quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation
   risk constructed by the digital twin model was compared with the
   quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation
   risk constructed by other traditional models. The comparison results
   showed that the output results of the evaluation model constructed by
   the digital twin model were closer to the actual results, and the
   accuracy rate was 35.9\% higher than that of the previous operational
   risk assessment model.},

Abstract = {Oil and Gas Pipeline (OGP) projects face a wide scope of wellbeing and
   security Risk Factors (RFs) all around the world, especially in the oil
   and gas delivering nations having influencing climate and unsampled
   data. Lacking data about the reasons for pipeline risk predictor and
   unstructured data about the security of the OGP prevent endeavors of
   moderating such dangers. This paper, subsequently, means to foster a
   risk analyzing framework in view of a comprehensive methodology of
   recognizing, dissecting and positioning the related RFs, and assessing
   the conceivable pipeline characteristics. Hazard Mitigation Methods
   (HMMs), which are the initial steps of this approach. A new methodology
   has been created to direct disappointment investigation of pinhole
   erosion in pipelines utilizing the typical pipeline risk strategy and
   erosion climate reenactments during a full life pattern of the pipeline.
   Hence in the proposed work, manifold learning with rank based clustering
   algorithm is incorporated with the cloud server for improved data
   analysis. The probability risk rate is identified from the burst
   pressure by clustering the normal and leak category to improve the
   accuracy of the prediction system experimented on the lab-scale oil
   pipeline system. The numerical results like auto-correlation,
   periodogram, Laplace transformed P-P Plot are utilized to estimate the
   datasets restructured by the manifold learning approach. The obtained
   experimental results shows that the cloud server datasets are clustered
   with rank prioritization to make proactive decision in faster manner by
   distinguishing labelled and unlabeled pressure attributes.},

Title = {Application of Digital Twin Combined with Artificial Intelligence and 5G
   Technology in the Art Design of Digital Museums},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {More and more museums are being established or restored as people's
   cultural levels grow. A digital twin is a computerized representation of
   the physical object or phenomenon, which acts as its real-time digital
   equivalent. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly
   widespread, and museums and art shows will need to change their old
   working and thinking processes to fully fulfill their potential. In an
   increasingly digital world, combining AI technologies and wearable
   devices into digital museums could assist in boosting involvement. It is
   necessary to investigate AI's strategic function and application in
   affecting tourist experiences at art galleries and museums, as well as
   its potential to improve education. Also, digital twin (DT) paves the
   way to alleviate difficulties or might improve access to digital museums
   via digital experiences. The historical report recommends that digital
   museum items be represented in a way that poses the fewest threats to
   its legitimacy. Owing to its uniqueness and vulnerability to substantial
   environmental dangers, the safeguarding of art and cultural heritage in
   digital museums is a serious issue. There are many approaches for
   assessing the state of artistic heritage and protecting it from extreme
   acts. The current study offers a framework for digitized museum art
   design based on the utilization of digital twin (DT), artificial
   intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation (5G) technologies. Further to
   enhance the security of the system, we employ the improved blowfish
   encryption algorithm (IBEA). Also, the authentication is done using the
   Diffie-Hellman protocol. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB,
   and its performance is analyzed and compared with conventional systems.
   From the result obtained, it was revealed that the suggested methodology
   express high range of security level (95\%) than the existing
   mechanisms. This study is very important in two directions: (1) it
   presents an analytical structure for having to adapt digital information
   to complicated systems in museums and (2) it explains the artistic
   obstacles for heritage properties, such as accessibility, execution
   time, security level, and the efficiency of 3-dimensional designs.},

   Continuous Lifecycle Integration},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings usually contain sophisticated facility systems and
   special medical equipment, strict security requirements, and business
   systems. Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of
   real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing
   innovations both in technique and management-a ``continuous lifecycle
   integration{''} method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and
   ``early movement{''} of the general contractor, this paper reported a
   successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized
   continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of
   more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O\&M
   phase up to the O\&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time
   visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was
   developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have
   the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual
   management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation
   suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building
   to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in
   the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy
   consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested
   repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.},

   enterprises to transform from focusing on financial accounting to
   focusing on group management and decision support. Digital twins make
   full use of physical models, sensor updates and other data, integrate
   interdisciplinary and multi-scale modeling processes, and perform
   complete mapping in virtual space, which can reflect the process of the
   entire life cycle of the corresponding physical equipment. Based on the
   technology of digital twin, this paper solved the related problems in
   the transformation and construction of accounting informatization, and
   proposed a clustering analysis algorithm. Company A was taken as the
   experimental object, companies B and C were taken as the experimental
   control group, combined with data analysis, among the accountants of
   company A, 179 people have a supportive attitude towards the
   transformation of accounting information, 16 people have a neutral
   attitude, and 5 people have an opposing attitude, accounting for 89.5\%,
   8\% and 2.5\% respectively. However, among companies B and C, 196 and
   199 people hold a favorable attitude, accounting for 98\% and 99.5\%
   respectively. The experimental results showed that the acceptance of the
   accounting informatization transformation is still relatively high among
   the employees of the enterprise.},

Title = {Automated Container Terminal Production Operation and Optimization via
   an AdaBoost-Based Digital Twin Framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT), machine learning, and industrial Internet of things
   (IIoT) provide great potential for the transformation of the container
   terminal from automation to intelligence. The production control in the
   loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs)
   involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for
   efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and
   security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost
   algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of
   physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the
   twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed
   framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is
   first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a
   random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best
   algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the
   experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than
   others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean
   square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we
   implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate
   the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of
   the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading
   efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing
   by 23.34\% and 31.46\% in small-scale and large-scale problems,
   respectively. Moreover, the visualization service provided by the DT
   system can monitor the status of automation equipment in real time to
   ensure the safety of operation.},

Title = {Digital Reconstruction Method of Power Metering Production Data Based on
   Digital Twin Technology},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {With the continuous improvement of the integration and intelligence of
   ubiquitous power Internet of things system equipment, its cost in life
   cycle management such as data service, operation monitoring, and safety
   protection is becoming higher and higher. At the same time, the
   probability of power grid failure, reduced operation efficiency, and
   function failure will gradually increase with the development of its
   scale. Accurately evaluating the metering performance of distribution
   network digital metering system in the operation of power system and
   improving its accuracy, stability, and reliability are the key issues
   for its future use in power trade settlement. In this paper, a digital
   reconstruction method of power metering production data based on digital
   twin is proposed. The operation data of power system is collected in
   real time through the data acquisition module, the operation data is
   analysed, identified, and predicted, and then the analysis,
   identification, and prediction results are used to realize the
   visualization and digitization of operation data. Further, the operation
   data of the digital metering system are monitored and analysed to verify
   the effectiveness of the method. The advantages and disadvantages of the
   design scheme of the digital metering system are obtained by analysing
   the active power error, which provides the basis of practice and
   selection for the application of the digital metering system.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of Digital Twin-Assisted Simulation Method for
   Autonomous Vehicle in Car-Following Scenario},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {The automated system replaces the driver, which makes autonomous vehicle
   to improve safety and convenience, so the market of autonomous vehicle
   is huge. However, the real-world application of autonomous vehicles
   faces many challenges due to the immaturity of automated systems. As a
   consequence, simulation verification plays an irreplaceable role in the
   application of autonomous vehicle (AV). Car-following is the most common
   driving scenario in mixed traffic flows, so it is essential to develop
   an appropriate and effective simulation method for AV. Combined with the
   existing AV simulation methods and digital twin (DT) technology, this
   paper proposes a DT-assisted method for AV simulation in a car-following
   scenario. The method makes the physical vehicle interact with the DT
   vehicle, and the DT vehicle can dynamically regulate the physical
   entities through real-time simulation data; the simulation verification
   can be displayed in the DT scenario to ensure the security of the
   simulation. Meanwhile, a DT-assisted simulation framework of AV is
   proposed, the framework includes physical entity components, DT
   components, and data processing and evaluation components. Besides, a
   DT-assisted simulation platform is developed base on Unity engine.
   Finally, the DT-assisted simulation of AV in the car-following scenario
   is implemented in field experiment. The experimental results show that
   the proposed method can be effectively conducted AV simulation in
   car-following, and the average of communication latency is 52.3 ms,
   which is smaller than the update frequency 15 Hz (66.6 ms) between
   DT-assisted platform and AV. The DT-assisted simulation method of AV
   proposed in this paper is applied in the car-following scenario, which
   effectively solves the challenges of car-following scenario simulation
   through virtual-real interaction.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},

Volume = {112},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This contribution presents a model for cyber-resilience of critical
   cyber infrastructures (CCI) based on the implementation of a digital
   twin. It addresses the risks associated with the in-tegration of
   computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus
   specifi-cally on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to
   its salience and to the poten-tial risks associated to failures in
   guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on in-formation
   security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational
   pic-ture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs' actors
   with increased cyber sit-uational awareness, common understanding of
   incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the
   model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of
   cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop
   a process model and validate three design propositions through a
   formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in
   the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this
   model for further research as well as practical applications for the
   electrical power sector. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Combined Anomaly Detection Framework for Digital Twins of Water
   Treatment Facilities},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital twins of cyber-physical systems with automated process control
   systems using programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are increasingly
   popular nowadays. At the same time, cyber-physical security is also a
   growing concern with system connectivity. This study develops a combined
   anomaly detection framework (CADF) against various types of security
   attacks on the digital twin of process control in water treatment
   facilities. CADF utilizes the PLC-based whitelist system to detect
   anomalies that target the actuators and the deep learning approach of
   natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) and probabilistic assessment to
   detect anomalies that target the sensors. The effectiveness of CADF is
   verified using a physical facility for water treatment with membrane
   processes called the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system in the
   Singapore University of Technology and Design. Various attack scenarios
   are tested in SWaT by falsifying the reported values of sensors and
   actuators in the digital twin process. These scenarios include both
   trivial attacks, which are commonly studied, as well as non-trivial
   (i.e., sophisticated) attacks, which are rarely reported. The results
   show that CADF performs very well with good detection accuracy in all
   scenarios, and particularly, it is able to detect all sophisticated
   attacks while ongoing before they can induce damage to the water
   treatment facility. CADF can be further extended to other cyber-physical
   systems in the future.},

Abstract = {A vision of the digital twins of the subsea pipelines is provided in
   this paper, with a coverage of the current applications and the
   challenges of the digital twins in the design, construction, service
   life, and assessments of life extension. Digital twins are described as
   a paradigm combining multi-physics modelling with data-driven analytics,

   virtual models of structural systems are shown to bridge the gap between
   design and construction and to mirror the real and virtual worlds.
   Challenges in properly using the new tools and how to create accurate
   digital twins considering data acquired during the construction phase
   are discussed. The key opportunities for improved integrity management
   using the digital twin are data contextualization, standardization,
   automated anomaly detection, and learning through sharing. The
   collection, interpretation and sharing of data, and cyber-security are
   identified as some of the main challenges.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the secure vehicle communications in
   cybertwin-enabled integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, where the
   digital twins (DTs) in the cybertwin space reflects the physical
   entities (i.e., satellite, terrestrial base station (BS), and vehicles).
   Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different
   satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links,
   it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and
   terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the
   information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information
   sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design
   by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be
   conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback
   information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel
   interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the
   implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated
   satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of
   maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the
   terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve
   such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization
   approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite
   programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the
   tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is
   also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out
   and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Abstract = {This paper presents an Augmented Reality software suite aiming at
   supporting the operator's interaction with flexible mobile robot
   workers. The developed AR suite, integrated with the shopfloor's Digital
   Twin, provides the operators' a) virtual interfaces to easily program
   the mobile robots b) information on the process and the production
   status, c) safety awareness by superimposing the active safety zones
   around the robots and d) instructions for recovering the system from
   unexpected events. The application's purpose is to simplify and
   accelerate the industrial manufacturing process by introducing an easy
   and intuitive way of interaction with the hardware, without requiring
   special programming skills or long training from the human operators.
   The proposed software is developed for the Microsoft's HoloLens Mixed
   Reality Headset 2, integrated with Robotic Operation System (ROS), and
   it has been tested in a case study inspired from the automotive

Abstract = {Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) in Germany-or Industrial Internet 4.0, as it is
   called internationally-are key initiatives in order to bring
   digitization into the automation domain by taking advantage of recent
   technology advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The core
   concept for I4.0 is the digital twin or asset administration shell
   (AAS), as it is called by the German Plattform Industrie 4.0 initiative.
   It shall provide a machine-readable description of I4.0 components,
   being available over the entire lifecycle and being used for various
   advanced use cases and services.
   Security has been an increasingly known and needed aspect during the
   last years and is a key requirement to make I4.0 actually happen. In a
   previous paper we proposed concepts for integrating authorization
   tightly into OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)-based information models.
   OPC UA is a new and promising industrial technology, which could be used
   to implement AAS concepts. The current proposals for AAS define
   necessary security concepts; however, there is no work explaining how
   these concepts can be implemented in OPC UA. This paper closes this gap
   by elaborating on realization alternatives in OPC UA. Furthermore, we
   extend our basic performance evaluation with more realistic data access
   patterns based on I4.0 use cases, showing the applicability of our
   approach in practice.},

Title = {Digital Twins: State of the art theory and practice, challenges, and
   open research questions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative
   all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time
   monitoring, simulation, optimisation and accurate forecasting. However,
   the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin
   (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an
   increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and
   industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly
   available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and
   effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share
   lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT
   methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research
   and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current
   approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to
   infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current
   limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread
   implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that
   the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast
   evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g.
   DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem-and
   domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT
   performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving
   technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT)
   and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as
   real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and
   individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation
   gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread
   adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed
   in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps,
   this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its
   components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a
   concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation,
   autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to
   showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses
   the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions,
   and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better
   understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice
   of DT and its allied technologies.},

Title = {Metrics development and modelling the mixed reality and digital twin
   adoption in the context of Industry 4.0},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1355-1376},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the current technology acceptance
   model (TAM) in the field of mixed reality and digital twin (MRDT) and
   identify key factors affecting users' intentions to use MRDT. The
   factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive
   model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users.
   This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
   Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was
   adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis
   of secondary data contained within published journal articles that
   focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items
   for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to
   meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were
   included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path
   coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b)
   test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the
   database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to
   2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly
   used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social
   influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived
   enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and
   behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the
   general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other
   important factors such as ``perceived immersion{''} could be added to
   the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to
   utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction
   project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic
   construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect
   employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The
   extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers
   or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of
   MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent
   due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and
   empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies
   which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality
   (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies
   may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer
   time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development
   in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a
   theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the
   individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research
   related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing
   managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to
   expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A
   set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will
   help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider
   acceptance.},

Abstract = {A 3-D digital twin is commonly understood to be a virtual image of a
   physical element. Such virtual images can appear in various forms with
   very different characteristics and areas of application - and at very
   different prices. However, the high cost of creating 3-D models of
   as-built bridges and the lack of integration hinder the widespread
   adoption of a promising technology for monitoring and managing as-built
   bridges. The report explains how an evolution of gaming technology and
   the use of AI significantly reduces the cost and barriers to creating
   digital twins, creating a scalable solution for many application areas.
   In order for the 3-D digital twins to unfold the desired added value,
   the integration of the respective systems is of decisive importance in
   addition to simple handling. Aspects such as cloud, loT and ERP
   connection, questions of connectivity as well as security and privacy
   are central elements of a successful integration of 3-D digital dwins
   into an existing data and IT ecosystem.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS},
Abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are presented as an alternative and
   decentralized solutions with different application scales for problems
   addressed to urban expansion as water quality reduction and floods. The
   usage of control strategies and mathematical modeling techniques has
   shown promising results for optimizing hydraulic and water treatment
   processes. The Digital Twins (DT) as process integration technology are
   widely used in industry, and recently these technique usages in urban
   water systems are showing effective results in both management and

   DT applied to NbS, especially for stormwater and transboundary water
   security projects. Thus, this paper sought through a literature review
   to access the existing conceptual challenges and the DT definition as a
   framework, identify how the mathematical modeling reported in the

Abstract = {The proliferation of cyber-physical systems is driving the growing need
   to establish links between these systems and virtual environments.
   Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and the
   imminent need to prevent manipulation of these devices in production
   environments make mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these
   physical objects in virtual environments necessary; this has been called
   a digital twin (DT). Conversley, cyberattacks are growing in all
   cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity is essential to the critical
   infrastructure of the smart grid. This work shows a small implementation
   of a DT system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment
   for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of DTs
   is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid, particularly in
   cybersecurity testing.},

Title = {Adoption of Blockchain Technology through Digital Twins in the
   Construction Industry 4.0: A PESTELS Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The key challenges of the building, engineering, construction,
   operations, and mining (BECOM) industries are the lack of trust,
   inefficiencies, and the fragmentation of the information value chain
   into vulnerable data silos throughout the lifecycle of projects. This
   paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of
   blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM
   industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information
   management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach
   is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges
   affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the
   technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS
   analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors
   affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a
   technological framework-namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle
   (DDTC)-that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and
   to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency,
   traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects'
   lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT
   with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things
   (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework
   offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around
   network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability,
   energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with
   IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects' lifecycles. The model also
   considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the
   circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key
   technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the
   DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works.
   Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and
   technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address
   the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry
   4.0.},

Title = {Microgrid Digital Twins: Concepts, Applications, and Future Trends},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {2284-2302},
Abstract = {Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances
   in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning
   concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry
   worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital
   representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its
   physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation
   platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the
   real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT
   technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated,
   which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs.
   MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and
   real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs'
   operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and
   maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its
   key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for
   establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different
   applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator
   training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and
   policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied
   the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided.
   Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and
   resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of
   digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for
   resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future
   trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, with the widespread industrial use of digital data and
   relative maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics
   (artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data
   visualization), we can design, customize, and implement plenty of
   systems which once were unimaginable. A combination of the mentioned
   fields leads to the emergence of new technology, i.e., Digital Twins
   (DT). The potentials of DT in different fields have changed the
   perspective of most academia/industry leaders around the world. The
   fundamental concept of DT lies in developing the living and intelligent
   model which faithfully mimics the physical system during the lifetime of
   the physical ones. Indeed, by co-evolving with the physical system, the
   DT can precisely explore the design flaws of the virtual environment and
   make quick changes, which will ameliorate the design, prevent tedious
   confirmation and experiments. In review research, the principle
   definitions, architecture, characteristics of DT as well as the enabling
   key technologies of this context are briefly provided; after that, the
   ranges of applications of DT in manufacturing and industry will be
   presented. In particular, the evaluation details and challenges related
   to the zero-emission ships along with its DT model, which recently have
   been getting attention in academia, industry, and government, have been
   discussed. Eventually, the standardized application of blockchain
   technology, regarded as distributed ledger technology (DLT), will be
   introduced as a practical solution for data storage, data access, data
   sharing, data security, and data integrity in the DT.},

Title = {A blockchain-based system to enhance aircraft parts traceability and
   trackability for inventory management},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {179},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Aircraft spare parts inventory management (ASPM) has played a critical
   role in tracing and tracking spare parts as any related maintenance or
   movement shall be recorded. Traceability and trackability of data ensure
   the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air
   Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of
   quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part's life cycle,
   leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance
   error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid
   increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts
   multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking
   operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information
   security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a
   managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability
   data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger
   Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based
   on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction
   operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing
   platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and
   operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and
   security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised
   ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and
   reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The
   enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the
   digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.},

Title = {Digitally twinned additive manufacturing: Detecting flaws in laser
   powder bed fusion by combining thermal simulations with in-situ meltpool
   sensor data},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {211},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The goal of this research is the in-situ detection of flaw formation in
   metal parts made using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive
   manufacturing process. This is an important area of research, because,
   despite the considerable cost and time savings achieved,
   precision-driven industries, such as aerospace and biomedical, are
   reticent in using LPBF to make safety-critical parts due to tendency of
   the process to create flaws. Another emerging concern in LPBF, and
   additive manufacturing in general, is related to cyber security -
   malicious actors may tamper with the process or plant flaws inside a
   part to compromise its performance. Accordingly, the objective of this
   work is to develop and apply a physics and data integrated strategy for
   online monitoring and detection of flaw formation in LPBF parts. The
   approach used to realize this objective is based on combining (twinning)
   in-situ meltpool temperature measurements with a graph theory-based
   thermal simulation model that rapidly predicts the temperature
   distribution in the part (thermal history). The novelty of the approach
   is that the temperature distribution predictions provided by the
   computational thermal model were updated layer-by-layer with in-situ
   meltpool temperature measurements. This digital twin approach is applied
   to detect flaw formation in stainless steel (316L) impeller-shaped parts
   made using a commercial LPBF system. Four such impellers are produced
   emulating three pathways of flaw formation in LPBF parts, these are:
   changes in the processing parameters (process drifts); machine-related
   malfunctions (lens delamination), and deliberate tampering with the
   process to plant flaws inside the part (cyber intrusions). The severity
   and nature of the resulting flaws, such as porosity and microstructure
   heterogeneity, are characterized ex-situ using X-ray computed
   tomography, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and electron
   backscatter diffraction. The digital twin approach is shown to be
   effective for detection of the three types of flaw formation causes
   studied in this work. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {In recent years, potentially disruptive identity-related topics emerged,
   such as digital twin technology for product lifecycle management or
   self-sovereign identity (SSI) for sovereign data control. In this study,
   we identify research streams and emerging trends in academic research on
   digital identity through a bibliometric analysis of 1,395 peer-reviewed
   articles and their 44,412 references. We derive seven distinct research
   streams and their interrelations by means of co-citation analysis. We
   name the seven research streams: i) Digital twin technology for smart
   manufacturing and industrial health monitoring, ii) identity-based
   signcryption schemes, iii) distributed networks and user privacy, iv)
   user authentication in wireless sensor networks, v) attribute-based
   encryption schemes, vi) secure data exchange in the Internet of Things
   and vii) blockchain and smart contracts for secure data management. Each
   stream's high-impact publications and its development over time are
   reviewed and the interrelation between publications and streams are
   visualized. In addition, we extract directions for future research from
   the field's most influential publications. The results offer a
   comprehensive and systematic overview of publications and discourses in
   digital identity research.},

Title = {A detailed design for a radioactive waste safety management system using
   ICT technologies},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {149},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A Radioactive Waste Information Management System (RAWINGS) currently in
   operation mainly manages the inventory and history of the operating
   waste. The system has the disadvantages of the entered information
   needing to be transferred manually from the site to the system,
   information getting incorrectly entered during the process or
   information going missing. Recently, the Nuclear Safety and Security
   Commission (NSSC) and Korea Radioactive Waste Agency (KORAD) called for
   the development of a digital system that can show information
   transparently in real-time regarding the preliminary inspections of
   RAdioactive Waste (RAW) and the assessment of its suitability for
   disposal before the radioactive waste is delivered to the disposal site.
   A Digital Twin (DT) system is being developed for the safety management
   of radioactive waste to address the problems that these systems have and
   meet the needs of disposal operators. This paper introduces the DT
   technology that uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology enabling users to
   check the contents of small-packaged wastes in radioactive waste drums
   without opening them, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor technology that
   checks the status of the drums in the radioactive waste storage and the
   RAWINGS system. Based on the performance of a prototype Digital Twin
   consisting of three modules (AR, IoT and RAWINGS), the augmented reality
   enables users to see the shape information and filling rate of
   small-packaged wastes in the radioactive waste drums and includes Quick
   Response (QR) code management. The basic data of the radioactive waste
   used in the augmented reality, as well as small packaged wastes and
   repackaged drums, were processed in conjunction with RAWINGS. In
   addition, real-time monitoring of radioactive waste drums loaded in the
   designated space (Y zone: an area where combustible waste is loaded
   within radioactive waste storage and TEST area: a section where drums
   scheduled to be transported to the disposal site are loaded) of the
   radioactive waste storage was possible by transmitting IoT sensor
   signals attached to the drum to the digital twin. Currently, augmented
   reality has an important role in enhancing the visibility and
   intuitiveness of radioactive waste information for radioactive waste
   managers and workers by overlapping digital information about
   radioactive waste storage. Due to the nature of radioactive waste, it is
   difficult to know what waste is inside the enclosed drum. However, the
   results of this study confirmed that waste contained in radioactive
   waste drums can be identified in real time in the Digital Twin rather
   than in the radioactive waste storage. This technology will be useful in
   determining the conformity of the radioactive waste acceptance criteria
   required by KORAD before the delivery of radioactive waste drums to
   disposal sites.},

Abstract = {Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for
   manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However,
   most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of
   Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor
   flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to
   support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article
   combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel
   manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the
   configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then,
   hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are
   designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of
   IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is
   presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT
   with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the
   autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an
   MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the
   proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment
   demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and
   decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive
   throughput and latency performance.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Several recent studies in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) focus on
   monitoring human movement and capturing data for further processing and
   analysis. However, there is a lack of studies that address the
   configurability and modularity of these systems, which is important for
   designing customized systems with customized devices. We propose a
   solution to solve this through a modular framework that automatically
   recognizes and configures new devices and provides real-time data
   wirelessly. The proposed framework creates a Digital Twin of the
   physical device and mirrors its attributes and sensory information into
   the cyber world so they can be used in real-time and post-routine
   analysis. As a proof of concept, a configurable CPS model for physical
   activities monitoring is designed and implemented. The designed gait
   monitoring and analysis system delivers spatiotemporal data from
   multiple multi-sensory devices to a central data handling and backup
   cloud server over conventional IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi. An experiment involving
   a young athlete examined whether or not the CPS components would
   recognize each other over foreign networks and communicate accurate

Abstract = {This article focuses on the process of improving health care in
   real-time experimental settings. Despite the fact that there are
   numerous solutions for health-care issues, no remote solution has been
   devised. As a result, a novel model has been devised in the suggested
   technique, in which all hospital administration processes are simplified
   through the use of a virtual representation digital twin process. When
   such technologies are used, a discrete protocol is followed, resulting
   in the identification and integration of a security model based on
   demand movement. A machine learning discriminant analysis has been
   combined with the process of digital twin functions efficiently based on
   input signals and state vectors. The cohesive model is put to the test
   in four case studies, including delay monitoring, predictive score
   analysis, communication units, and battery charge rate, with all case
   study outcomes proving to be more effective than existing systems by an
   average of 74\%.},

Title = {Safe and secure platooning of Automated Guided Vehicles in Industry 4.0},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are widely used for materials
   transportation. Operating them in a platooned manner has the potential
   to improve safety, security and efficiency, control overall traffic flow
   and reduce resource usage. However, the published studies on platooning
   focus mainly on the design of technical solutions in the context of
   automotive domain. In this paper we focus on a largely unexplored theme
   of platooning in production sites transformed to the Industry 4.0, with
   the aim of providing safety and security assurances. We present an
   overall approach for a fault- and threat tolerant platooning for
   materials transportation in production environments. Our functional use
   cases include the platoon control for collision avoidance, data
   acquisition and processing by considering range, and connectivity with
   fog and cloud levels. To perform the safety and security analyses, the
   Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and Threat and Operability (THROP)
   techniques are used. Based on the results obtained from them, the safety
   and security requirements are derived for the identification and
   prevention/mitigation of potential platooning hazards, threats and
   vulnerabilities. The assurance cases are constructed to show the
   acceptable safety and security of materials transportation using AGV
   platooning. We leveraged a simulation-based digital twin for performing
   the verification and validation as well as finetuning of the platooning
   strategy. Simulation data is gathered from digital twin to monitor
   platoon operations, identify unexpected or incorrect behaviour, evaluate
   the potential implications, trigger control actions to resolve them, and
   continuously update assurance cases. The applicability of the AGV
   platooning is demonstrated in the context of a quarry site.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of a Real-Time Hardware-in-the-Loop Platform

Abstract = {Power systems worldwide are experiencing rapid evolvements with a
   massive increase of renewable generation in order to meet the ambitious
   decarbonization targets. A significant amount of renewable generation is
   from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), upon which the system
   operators often have limited visibility. This can bring significant
   challenges as the increasing DERs' can lead to network constraints being
   violated, presenting critical risks for network security. Enhancing the
   visibility of DERs can be achieved via the provision of communication
   links, but this can be costly, particularly for real time applications.
   Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is considered as a
   promising solution for enhancing the visibility of a physical system,
   where only a limited set of data is required to be transmitted with the
   rest data of interest can be estimated via the DT. The development and
   demonstration of DTs requires realistic testing and validation
   enviorment in order to accelerate its adoption in the industry. This
   paper presents a real time simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL)
   testing platform, specifically designed for prototyping, demonstrating
   and testing DTs of DERs. Within the proposed platform, a software-based
   communication emulator is developed, which allows the investigation of
   the impact of communication latency and jitter on the performance of DTs
   of the DERs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application
   of the developed DT prototyping process and testing platform to enable
   frequency control using the DTs, which provide valuable learnings and
   tools for enabling future DTs-based solutions.},

Title = {Digital Twins in Built Environments: An Investigation of the
   Characteristics, Applications, and Challenges},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The concept of digital twins is proposed as a new technology-led
   advancement to support the processes of the design, construction, and
   operation of built assets. Commonalities between the emerging
   definitions of digital twins describe them as digital or cyber
   environments that are bidirectionally-linked to their physical or
   real-life replica to enable simulation and data-centric decision making.
   Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of
   asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different
   levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However,
   questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation
   challenges, including their integration with other digital technologies
   (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality,
   Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing).
   Within the built environment context, this study seeks to analyze the
   definitions and characteristics of a digital twin, its interactions with
   other digital technologies used in built asset delivery and operation,
   and its applications and challenges. To achieve this aim, the research
   utilizes a thorough literature review and semi-structured interviews
   with ten industry experts. The literature review explores the merits and
   the relevance of digital twins relative to existing digital technologies
   and highlights potential applications and challenges for their
   implementation. The data from the semi-structured interviews are
   classified into five themes: definitions and enablers of digital twins,
   applications and benefits, implementation challenges, existing practical
   applications, and future development. The findings provide a point of
   departure for future research aimed at clarifying the relationship
   between digital twins and other digital technologies and their key
   implementation challenges.},

Title = {Optimization of construction management in underground construction
   using digital infrastructure information models},
Journal = {BAUTECHNIK},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Number = {11},
Pages = {780-788},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The previous applications of new digital methods (BIM) in infrastructure
   construction have led to the realization that merely a building
   information model is not sufficient for the ambitious goals of an
   optimized planning process and, as a result, optimized construction
   management. Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and
   that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in
   underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the
   structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to
   map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the
   ideal case of a ``digital twin{''}. The modeling of the ground goes
   beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do
   justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and
   characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major
   international projects clearly show that the optimization of
   construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment
   and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the
   production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and
   schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the
   introduction of an infrastructure information model, which contains the
   three submodels ground, building and construction site. The main focus
   will be on underground construction, more precisely on mechanized
   tunnelling.},

Title = {A Roadmap to Integrate Digital Twins for Small and Medium-Sized
   Enterprises},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {In the last decade, Australian SMEs are steadily becoming more digitally
   engaged, but they still face issues and barriers to fully adopt Industry
   4.0 (I4.0). Among the tools that I4.0 encompasses, digital twin (DT) and
   digital thread (DTH) technologies hold significant interest and value.
   Some of the challenges are the lack of expertise in developing the
   communication framework required for data collection, processing, and
   storing; concerns about data and cyber security; lack of knowledge of
   the digitization and visualisation of data; and value generation for
   businesses from the data. This article aims to demonstrate the
   feasibility of DT implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs) by developing a framework based on simple and low-cost solutions
   and providing insight and guidance to overcome technological barriers.
   To do so, this paper first outlines the theoretical framework and its
   components, and subsequently discusses a simplified and generalised DT
   model of a real-world physical asset that demonstrates how these
   components function, how they are integrated and how they interact with
   each other. An experimental scenario is presented to transform data
   harvested from a resistance temperature detector sensor connected with a
   WAGO 750-8102 Programmable Logic Controller for data storage and
   analysis, predictive simulation and modelling. Our results demonstrate
   that sensor data could be readily integrated from Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) devices and enabling DT technologies, where users could view real
   time data and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the form of a 3D
   model. Data from both the sensor and 3D model are viewable in a
   comprehensive history log through a database. Via this technological
   demonstration, we provide several recommendations on software, hardware,
   and expertise that SMEs may adopt to assist with their DT
   implementations.},

Abstract = {A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system
   interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged.
   Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one
   of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently,
   the training of students and professionals has to address these new
   demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational
   tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that
   implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as
   connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the
   cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity
   measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational
   environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies
   reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes
   cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an
   industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen
   cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to
   transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and
   analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set
   of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been
   proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the
   enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real
   automation. This course has been taught in a master's degree and
   students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey.
   The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the
   students' and faculty's viewpoint.},

Abstract = {Digital twins are emerging as powerful tools for supporting innovation
   as well as optimizing the in-service performance of a broad range of
   complex physical machines, devices, and components. A digital twin is
   generally designed to provide accurate in-silico representation of the
   form (i.e., appearance) and the functional response of a specified
   (unique) physical twin. This paper offers a new perspective on how the
   emerging concept of digital twins could be applied to accelerate
   materials innovation efforts. Specifically, it is argued that the
   material itself can be considered as a highly complex multiscale
   physical system whose form (i.e., details of the material structure over
   a hierarchy of material length) and function (i.e., response to external
   stimuli typically characterized through suitably defined material
   properties) can be captured suitably in a digital twin. Accordingly, the
   digital twin can represent the evolution of structure, process, and
   performance of the material over time, with regard to both process
   history and in-service environment. This paper establishes the
   foundational concepts and frameworks needed to formulate and
   continuously update both the form and function of the digital twin of a
   selected material physical twin. The form of the proposed material
   digital twin can be captured effectively using the broadly applicable
   framework of n-point spatial correlations, while its function at the
   different length scales can be captured using homogenization and
   localization process-structure-property surrogate models calibrated to
   collections of available experimental and physics-based simulation data.},

Abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for critical decision-making
   processes. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls
   for an infrastructure that can ensure the trustworthiness of data. To
   this end, we envision a blockchain-based framework for the Industrial
   Internet of Things (IIoT) to address the issues of data management and
   security. Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded
   in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven
   systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In
   this regard, we leverage digital twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent
   conclusions from the data by identifying the faults and recommending
   precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss
   the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of
   disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault
   diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT
   and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs.},

Title = {A data-driven operational model for traffic at the Dallas Fort Worth
   International Airport},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Airports are on the front line of significant innovations, allowing the
   movement of more people and goods faster, cheaper, and with greater
   convenience. As air travel continues to grow, airports will face
   challenges in responding to increasing passenger vehicle traffic, which
   leads to lower operational efficiency, poor air quality, and security
   concerns. This paper evaluates methods for traffic demand forecasting
   combined with traffic microsimulation, which will allow airport
   operations staff to accurately predict traffic and congestion. Using two
   years of detailed data describing individual vehicle arrivals and
   departures, aircraft movements, and weather at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
   International Airport, we evaluate multiple prediction methods including
   the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) family of models,
   traditional machine learning models, and DeepAR, a modern recurrent
   neural network (RNN). We find that these algorithms are able to capture
   the diurnal trends in the surface traffic, and all do very well when
   predicting the next 30 minutes of demand. Longer forecast horizons are
   moderately effective, demonstrating the challenge of this problem and
   highlighting promising techniques as well as potential areas for
   improvement. Traffic demand is not the only factor that contributes to
   terminal congestion, because temporary changes to the road network, such
   as a lane closure, can make benign traffic demand highly congested.
   Combining a demand forecast with a traffic microsimulation framework
   provides a complete picture of traffic and its consequences. The result
   is an operational intelligence platform for exploring policy changes, as
   well as infrastructure expansion and disruption scenarios. To
   demonstrate the value of this approach, we present results from a case
   study at DFW Airport assessing the impact of a policy change for vehicle
   routing in high demand scenarios. This framework can assist airports
   like DFW as they tackle daily operational challenges, as well as explore
   the integration of emerging technology and expansion of their services
   into long term plans.},

Abstract = {Featured Application
   Perimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous
   vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles.
   Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in
   the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system
   life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts.
   The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to
   efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use
   digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative
   evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system
   performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE
   experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current
   testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a
   smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios,
   connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation
   engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been
   successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security
   system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for
   autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated
   and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system
   behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and
   conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop
   control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are
   presented along with a discussion of future directions.},

Title = {Intelligent Tensioning Method for Prestressed Cables Based on Digital
   Twins and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large
   scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control
   requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel
   structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and
   artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of
   prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is
   proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and
   DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion
   mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive
   intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In
   addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent
   control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By
   considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the
   tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing
   the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent
   tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent
   tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and
   intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional
   integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of
   the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of
   digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the
   intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses
   on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance.
   This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI
   in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.},

Title = {Additive Manufacturing Cyber-Physical System: Supply Chain Cybersecurity
   and Risks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {47322-47333},
Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient
   and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the
   freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and
   pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM
   have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid
   growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general
   characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain
   models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of
   the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply
   chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the
   virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively
   manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain
   (<italic>digital thread</italic>) with the physical supply chain and
   their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical
   system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of
   a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible
   attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse
   engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk
   classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity
   methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that
   threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing
   solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In
   providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies
   of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate
   the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further,
   we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and
   identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.},

Title = {A systematic survey of attack detection and prevention in Connected and
   Autonomous Vehicles},
Journal = {VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The number of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is increasing
   rapidly in various smart transportation services and applications,
   considering many benefits to society, people, and the environ-ment.
   Several research surveys for CAVs were conducted by primarily focusing
   on various security threats and vulnerabilities in the domain of CAVs to
   classify different types of attacks, impacts of attacks, attack
   features, cyber-risk, defense methodologies against attacks, and safety
   standards. However, the importance of attack detection and prevention
   approaches for CAVs has not been discussed extensively in the
   state-of-the-art surveys, and there is a clear gap in the existing
   literature on such methodologies to detect new and conventional threats
   and protect the CAV systems from unexpected hazards on the road. Some
   surveys have a limited discussion on Attacks Detection and Prevention
   Systems (ADPS), but such surveys provide only partial coverage of
   different types of ADPS for CAVs. Furthermore, there is a scope for
   discussing security, privacy, and efficiency challenges in ADPS that can
   give an overview of important security and performance attributes. This
   survey paper, therefore, presents the significance of CAVs in the
   market, potential challenges in CAVs, key requirements of essential
   security and privacy properties, various capabilities of adversaries,
   possible attacks in CAVs, and performance evaluation parameters for
   ADPS. An extensive analysis is discussed of different ADPS categories
   for CAVs and state-of-the-art research works based on each ADPS category
   that gives the latest findings in this research domain. This survey also
   discusses crucial and open security research problems that are required
   to be focused on the secure deployment of CAVs in the market. (C) 2022

Abstract = {As DNA sequencing and synthesis become cheaper and more easily
   accessible, the scale and complexity of biological engineering projects
   is set to grow. Yet, although there is an accelerating convergence
   between biotechnology and digital technology, a deficit in software and
   laboratory techniques diminishes the ability to make biotechnology more
   agile, reproducible, and transparent while, at the same time, limiting
   the security and safety of synthetic biology constructs. To partially
   address some of these problems, this paper presents an approach for
   physically linking engineered cells to their digital footprint-we called
   it digital twinning. This enables the tracking of the entire engineering
   history of a cell line in a specialized version control system for
   collaborative strain engineering via simple barcoding protocols.},

Abstract = {Currently, the concept of Industry 4.0 is well known; however, it is
   extremely complex, as it is constantly evolving and innovating. It
   includes the participation of many disciplines and areas of knowledge as
   well as the integration of many technologies, both mature and emerging,
   but working in collaboration and relying on their study and
   implementation under the novel criteria of Cyber-Physical Systems. This
   study starts with an exhaustive search for updated scientific
   information of which a bibliometric analysis is carried out with results
   presented in different tables and graphs. Subsequently, based on the
   qualitative analysis of the references, we present two proposals for the
   schematic analysis of Industry 4.0 that will help academia and companies
   to support digital transformation studies. The results will allow us to
   perform a simple alternative analysis of Industry 4.0 to understand the
   functions and scope of the integrating technologies to achieve a better
   collaboration of each area of knowledge and each professional,
   considering the potential and limitations of each one, supporting the
   planning of an appropriate strategy, especially in the management of
   human resources, for the successful execution of the digital
   transformation of the industry.},

Title = {Threat modelling for industrial cyber physical systems in the era of
   smart manufacturing},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cyber security risks are considered to be one of the foremost challenges
   that face organisations intending to leverage the benefits of the Smart
   Manufacturing paradigm. Due to the rising number of cyber-attacks that
   target critical Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), organisations
   are required to consider such attacks as severe business risks.
   Therefore, identifying potential cyber threats and analysing their
   impacts is crucial to business continuity planning. This paper proposes
   a structured threat modelling approach for ICPS that enables prediction
   and analysis of cyber risks to protect industrial assets from potential
   cyber-attacks. The method involves classifying ICPS assets based on
   criticality, and then analysing the cyber security vulner-abilities,
   threats, risks, impacts, and countermeasures. The proposed methodology
   enables end-to-end threat modelling through the development of a new
   framework that is integrated with VueOne digital twin tool to model and
   analyse threats throughout ICPS lifecycle, identifying cyber risks and
   proposing mitigation controls. Moreover, it uses meta-data extracted
   from VueOne tool to automatically generate the software code and
   hardware configurations that can be directly deployed on ICPS assets in
   order to implement the countermeasures, thereby protecting them from
   these potential cyber-attacks. The proposed solution has been
   implemented on a Festo test rig prototype production line. (C) 2022

Title = {Key Component Capture and Safety Intelligent Analysis of Beam String
   Structure Based on Digital Twins},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the construction process of beam string structures, the environmental
   effect and corresponding mechanical properties of the structure are
   complex. The problem of the misjudgment of structural safety performance
   caused by the uncertainty of a structural mechanical parameter analysis
   under various factors needs to be solved. In this study, a method for
   capturing key components and an intelligent safety analysis of beam
   string structures based on digital twins (DTs) was proposed. Combined
   with the characteristics of DTs mapping feedback, a component capture
   and security analysis framework was formed. Driven by twin framework,
   multi-source data for structural safety analysis were obtained and the
   parameter association mechanism established. Considering the space-time
   evolution and the interaction between the virtual and real elements of
   the construction process, a multidimensional model was established.
   Driven by the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, the fusion of
   structural mechanics parameters was carried out. The safety of the
   structure was analyzed intelligently by capturing key structural
   components, thereby providing a basis for the safety maintenance of the
   structure. The integration of DTs modeling and multi-source data
   improves the accuracy and intelligence of structural construction safety
   analysis. In the analysis process, capturing the key components of the
   structure is the core step. Taking the construction process of a string
   supported beam roof (symmetrical structure) in a convention and
   exhibition center as an example, the outlined research method was
   applied. Based on DTs and D-S evidence theory, the variation degree of
   mechanical parameters of various components under temperature was
   determined. By comprehensively investigating the changes of various
   mechanical parameters, the key components of the structure were
   captured. Thus, the intelligent analysis of structural safety was
   realized. The comparison of data verified that the intelligent method
   can effectively analyze the safety performance of the structure.},

Title = {Project Data Categorization, Adoption Factors, and Non-Functional
   Requirements for Blockchain Based Digital Twins in the Construction
   Industry 4.0},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As key technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, blockchain and
   digital twins have great potential to enhance collaboration, data
   sharing, efficiency, and sustainability in the construction industry.
   Blockchain can improve data integrity and enhance trust in the data
   value chain throughout the entire lifecycle of projects. This paper aims
   to develop a novel theoretical framework for the adoption of
   environmentally sustainable blockchain-based digital twins (BCDT) for
   Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from
   construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit
   CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and
   non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a
   decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of
   the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects
   lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and
   what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the
   adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of
   structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate
   the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework
   for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The
   findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs
   relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new
   dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2)
   Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is
   decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new
   level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance
   collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data
   sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main
   non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy,
   interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the
   decentralization and scalability of data storage. With the proposed
   framework including the BCDT dimensions, the Maturity Level 4, and the
   key non-functional requirements, this paper provides the building blocks
   for industry practitioners to adopt BCDTs. This is promising for CI 4.0
   to embrace a paradigm shift towards decentralized ecosystems of united
   BCDTs where trust, collaboration, data sharing, information security,
   efficiency, and sustainability are improved throughout the lifecycle of
   projects and within a decentralized CE (DCE).},

Title = {Communications in the 6G Era},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {57063-57074},
Abstract = {The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G
   deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish
   a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research.
   In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication
   needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of
   connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true
   representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial
   and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical,
   biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will
   shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new
   man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices
   acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among
   multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to
   create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv)
   precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With
   rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to
   become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data,
   compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving
   superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other
   major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i)
   cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the
   integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system
   definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on

Abstract = {As the number of civil aerial vehicles increase explosively, spectrum
   scarcity and security become an increasingly challenge in both the
   airspace and terrestrial space. To address this difficulty, this paper
   presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum
   mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by
   spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction
   algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method
   and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision
   mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a
   three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and
   security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital
   twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the
   proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even
   when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of
   the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with
   the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation
   results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the
   classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the
   tensor completion method by about 12.5\% and 92.3\%, respectively, in
   terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are
   regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.},

Abstract = {Smart factories in harsh large-scale environments are achieved by
   installation of group-based industrial wireless sensor networks
   (GIWSNs), in which a group of sensors are deployed on each machine
   target, for security and saving deployment time. In GIWSNs, enormous
   data for production (e.g., 3D digital twin and automated optical
   inspection images) and surveillance is transmitted frequently among
   multiple machines, and consumes huge energy. Furthermore, a real-world
   factory whose radio environment is interfered by mobile devices is
   dynamic and uncertain. Therefore, this paper investigates reliable
   energy-efficient routing for surveillance in dynamic uncertain GIWSNs,
   and further proposes a fuzzy improved global-best harmony search
   approach, where improved operators are integrated to efficiently explore
   the search space locally and globally; and a fuzzy evaluation scheme is
   employed to address uncertain factors. Through simulation under various
   parameter settings, this approach can find reliable routing in dynamic
   environments, and shows high performance as compared with other
   approaches. In addition, this approach can always find the reliable
   surveillance routing under various data amounts, while activating fewer
   crucial sensors to effectively reduce energy consumption.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply
   chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including
   those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical
   supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials
   increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors
   like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair
   practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of
   lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of
   food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through
   challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and
   contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and
   survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent
   hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the
   system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world
   implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and
   detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in
   using it to serve their communities.},

Title = {A Systematic Literature Review on RAMS analysis for critical
   infrastructures protection},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety/Security (RAMS)
   analysis of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) can be applied to investigate
   their performance subjected to failure modes. The literature has
   witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the
   integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to
   develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant
   aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In
   recent times, digital components and systems com-prising information and
   communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster
   protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a
   considerable cost, such as the necessity to in-tegrate innovative
   cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities,
   efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development,
   resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current
   knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
   focused on address-ing integrated protection aspects, recent
   developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs.
   Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing
   studies dealing with devel-oping techniques, methodologies, protocols,
   models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR
   followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between
   2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212
   records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally,
   after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19
   articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a com-parative
   analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in
   different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies,
   performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenar-ios, targeted
   applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects
   associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is
   an emerging research area, with currently focused appli-cations
   including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing,
   maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8\% of the
   studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining
   approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis.
   Also, 84.2\% of the included studies focus on integrating only three
   aspects of CIs protection. Finally, the open research chal-lenges and
   limitations of existing studies and their respective emerging solutions
   are presented.

Abstract = {Today's power systems are seeing a paradigm shift under the energy
   transition, sparkled by the electrification of demand, digitalisation of
   systems, and an increasing share of decarbonated power generation. Most
   of these changes have a direct impact on their control centers, forcing
   them to handle weather-based energy resources, new interconnections with
   neighbouring transmission networks, more markets, active distribution
   networks, micro-grids, and greater amounts of available data.
   Unfortunately, these changes have translated during the past decade to
   small, incremental changes, mostly centered on hardware, software, and
   human factors. We assert that more transformative changes are needed,
   especially regarding human-centered design approaches, to enable control
   room operators to manage the future power system. This paper discusses
   the evolution of operators towards continuous operation planners,
   monitoring complex time horizons thanks to adequate real-time
   automation. Reviewing upcoming challenges as well as emerging
   technologies for power systems, we present our vision of a new
   evolutionary architecture for control centers, both at back-end and
   frontend levels. We propose a unified hypervision scheme based on
   structured decision-making concepts, providing operators with proactive,
   collaborative, and effective decision support.},

Abstract = {With the large-scale commercial launch of fifth generation (5G) mobile
   network, the development of new services and applications catering to
   the year 2030, along with the deep convergence of information,

   driving forces of the evolution of the mobile network architecture and
   proposes a logical function architecture for sixth generation (6G)
   mobile network. The proposed 6G network architecture is termed SOLIDS
   (related to the following basic features: soft, on-demand fulfillment,
   lite, native intelligence, digital twin, and native security), which can
   support self-generation, self-healing, self-evolution, and self-immunity

Abstract = {This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey on information
   integration (II) in space informatics. With an ever-increasing scale and
   dynamics of complex space systems, II has become essential in dealing
   with the complexity, changes, dynamics, and uncertainties of space
   systems. The applications of space II (SII) require addressing some
   distinctive functional requirements (FRs) of heterogeneity, networking,
   communication, security, latency, and resilience; while limited works
   are available to examine recent advances of SII thoroughly. This survey
   helps to gain the understanding of the state of the art of SII in sense
   that (1) technical drivers for SII are discussed and classified; (2)
   existing works in space system development are analyzed in terms of
   their contributions to space economy, divisions, activities, and
   missions; (3) enabling space information technologies are explored at
   aspects of sensing, communication, networking, data analysis, and system
   integration; (4) the importance of first-time right (FTR) for
   implementation of a space system is emphasized, the limitations of
   digital twin (DT-I) as technological enablers are discussed, and a
   concept digital-triad (DT-II) is introduced as an information platform
   to overcome these limitations with a list of fundamental design
   principles; (5) the research challenges and opportunities are discussed
   to promote SII and advance space informatics in future.},

Title = {Digital soil mapping and assessment for Australia and beyond: A
   propitious future},
Journal = {GEODERMA REGIONAL},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment (DSMA) has progressed from
   challenging traditional soil science paradigms, through small scale
   prototyping, to large-scale implementation capturing quantitative
   measures of soil attributes and functions. This paper considers the
   future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where
   high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding
   to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is
   for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided
   from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as
   a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a
   strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory,
   tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore
   expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of
   base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and
   forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer
   spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly
   globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of
   DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis
   of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to
   provide the background to a soil and landscape `digital twin' and the
   consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of
   land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA
   skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice
   involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools.
   Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of
   public-private partnerships in this development and application. (C)

Title = {Educational 5G Edge Computing: Framework and Experimental Study},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},

Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Benefiting from the large-scale commercial use of 5G, smart campuses
   have attracted increasing research attention in recent years and are
   expected to revolutionize traditional campus activities. However, there
   are some obstacles that hinder the practical deployment of MEC
   (multi-access edge computing). First, traditional information
   infrastructures on campus cannot support latency-sensitive and
   computing-intensive smart applications, such as AR/VR, live interactive
   lectures and digital twin experiments. In addition, the mixture of old
   and new applications, isolated data islands and heterogeneous equipment
   management introduce more challenges. Moreover, the existing MEC
   framework proposed by ETSI and 3GPP cannot meet the specific deployment
   requirements of smart campuses, e.g., educational data security,
   real-time interactive applications, heterogeneous connections, and
   others. In this paper, we propose a 5G-based architecture for smart
   education information infrastructure; a new dedicated cloud architecture
   eMEC (educational multi-access edge computing) is defined. It consists
   of a UGW (universal access gateway) and an eMEP (educational
   multi-access edge computing platform), making it possible to satisfy
   education-specific requirements and long-term evolution. Furthermore, we
   implement the framework and conduct real-world field tests for eMEC in a
   university campus. Based on the framework and practical field tests, we
   also conduct a measurement study to unveil the spatial-temporal
   characteristics of mobile users in the smart campus and discuss
   exploiting them for better network performance. The experimental results
   show that the system achieves satisfactory performance in terms of both
   throughput and latency.},

Title = {XGBoost for Imbalanced Multiclass Classification-Based Industrial
   Internet of Things Intrusion Detection Systems},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has advanced digital technology
   and the fastest interconnection, which creates opportunities to
   substantially grow industrial businesses today. Although IIoT provides
   promising opportunities for growth, the massive sensor IoT data
   collected are easily attacked by cyber criminals. Hence, IIoT requires
   different high security levels to protect the network. An Intrusion
   Detection System (IDS) is one of the crucial security solutions, which
   aims to detect the network's abnormal behavior and monitor safe network
   traffic to avoid attacks. In particular, the effectiveness of the
   Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS approach to building a secure IDS
   application is attracting the security research community in both the
   general cyber network and the specific IIoT network. However, most
   available IIoT datasets contain multiclass output data with imbalanced
   distributions. This is the main reason for the reduction in the
   detection accuracy of attacks of the ML-based IDS model. This research
   proposes an IDS for IIoT imbalanced datasets by applying the eXtremely
   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to overcome this issue. Two modern
   IIoT imbalanced datasets were used to assess our proposed method's
   effectiveness and robustness, X-IIoTDS and TON\_IoT. The XGBoost model
   achieved excellent attack detection with F1 scores of 99.9\% and 99.87\%
   on the two datasets. This result demonstrated that the proposed approach
   improved the detection attack performance in imbalanced multiclass IIoT
   datasets and was superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

Title = {Sustainable small-scale hydropower solutions in Central Asian countries
   for local and cross-border energy/water supply},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Central Asian area is confronted with a number of acute obstacles as
   it attempts to transition to a long-term electrical power supply.
   Small-scale hydropower systems may be a viable answer to these problems.
   Central Asian nations' hydropower resources are allocated unevenly.
   Regardless, it remains the most exploitable renewable energy source in
   the area, with both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan possessing some of the
   world's highest hydropower potential. Nonetheless, for fossil-fuel-rich
   nations like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan, hydropower will
   play a significant role in the future energy balance. Furthermore,
   because rivers often run across many boundaries, water security plays an
   important role in cross-border relations between Central Asian
   countries. To achieve effective exploitation of small hydropower
   potential, technological and financial expen-ditures are needed to
   improve the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of diverse hydroelectric
   equipment by increasing lifetime, improving efficiency, and increasing
   yearly power output. Several of these issues can be resolved by
   installing small and micro hydropower plants in the many minor rivers
   and irrigation canals. A pumped hydro energy storage system should also
   be tested and certified for better usability. A hydrological digital
   twin of relevant river system and irrigation network should be
   constructed to increase the understanding for performance and enable
   system-level improvement. Furthermore, optimal performance necessitates
   constant monitoring of the network, necessitating the development of
   intelligent monitoring employing sensors in conjunction with control
   systems and smart grid interactions. This review focuses on the broad
   and efficient use of these existing resources, which are still
   underutilized.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in
   Internet of Things (IoT) not only threatens the security of digital
   devices and infrastructure but also severely degrades IoT system
   performance due to the overly consumed network resources. With the
   knowledge of identity information of devices and signaling data,
   Internet service providers (ISPs) can detect and block DDoS traffic by
   monitoring the upstream IoT packets, and thereby, improve network
   efficiency. However, inspecting all data packets online for DDoS
   detection will significantly increase both the network delay and the
   computational overhead. Therefore, the packet sampling strategy is
   crucial for the defenders to detect DDoS attacks. To this end, this
   article formulates a Stackelberg game model to analyze the collaborative
   IoT packet sampling against DDoS attacks. Through the equilibrium
   analysis of the DDoS game, we derive the lower bound of packet sampling
   rate (PSR) that can effectively deter potential attackers. Unlike
   traditional offline detection, our proposed packet sampling strategy can
   support both the online detection and proactive prevention of DDoS
   traffic. As a use case, a multipoint DDoS defense framework is developed
   to address the IP spoofing in 5G networks based on the proposed packet
   sampling strategy, which deters DDoS attacks and reduces the packet
   sampling cost, and thereby, maximizes the IoT utility, compared with
   existing methods. In typical reflection attacks (in which no more than
   five packets of response are triggered by a request packet), our
   proposed scheme not only reduces more than 70\% of the sampling rate but
   also demonstrates superior robustness against boundary condition
   variation.},

Abstract = {The papers in this special section focus on the topic of green
   industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These papers aim to consolidate
   the current state of the art in terms of fundamental research ideas and
   network engineering, geared toward exploiting greenness of IIoT. The
   IIoT is a new ecosystem that combines intelligent and autonomous
   machines, advanced predictive analytics, and machine-human collaboration
   to improve productivity, efficiency, and reliability. IIoT connects
   billions of mobile digital devices, manufacturing machines, industrial
   equipment, etc., and generates an unprecedented volume of industrial
   data. The gap between the rapidly growing demands of data rate and
   existing bandwidth-limited network infrastructures has become ever
   prominent. Moreover, the interaction and connection of things in IIoT
   will consume substantial energy in contrast with limited energy storage
   of the things. Therefore, the greenness of IIoT is crucial for the
   success of IIoT. In particular, with the prevalence of mobile devices,
   electronic devices, cameras, social networks, social media, etc.,
   ourworld is generating big data and multimedia big data, which further
   aggregate the energy demand in terms of the data transmission and
   processing of IIoT.},

Title = {The Hitchhiker's Guide to Fused Twins: A Review of Access to Digital
   Twins In Situ in Smart Cities},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Smart Cities already surround us, and yet they are still
   incomprehensibly far from directly impacting everyday life. While
   current Smart Cities are often inaccessible, the experience of everyday
   citizens may be enhanced with a combination of the emerging technologies
   Digital Twins (DTs) and Situated Analytics. DTs represent their Physical
   Twin (PT) in the real world via models, simulations, (remotely) sensed
   data, context awareness, and interactions. However, interaction requires
   appropriate interfaces to address the complexity of the city.
   Ultimately, leveraging the potential of Smart Cities requires going
   beyond assembling the DT to be comprehensive and accessible. Situated
   Analytics allows for the anchoring of city information in its spatial
   context. We advance the concept of embedding the DT into the PT through
   Situated Analytics to form Fused Twins (FTs). This fusion allows access
   to data in the location that it is generated in in an embodied context
   that can make the data more understandable. Prototypes of FTs are
   rapidly emerging from different domains, but Smart Cities represent the
   context with the most potential for FTs in the future. This paper
   reviews DTs, Situated Analytics, and Smart Cities as the foundations of
   FTs. Regarding DTs, we define five components (physical, data,
   analytical, virtual, and Connection Environments) that we relate to
   several cognates (i.e., similar but different terms) from existing
   literature. Regarding Situated Analytics, we review the effects of user
   embodiment on cognition and cognitive load. Finally, we classify
   existing partial examples of FTs from the literature and address their
   construction from Augmented Reality, Geographic Information Systems,
   Building/City Information Models, and DTs and provide an overview of
   future directions.},

Title = {Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture on a Geospatial Cloud
   Framework},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Humanity is confronted with the grand challenge of how to increase
   agricultural production to achieve food security during the 21st century
   and feed a population that is expected to grow to 10 billion people.
   This needs to be done while maintaining sustainable agricultural systems
   and simultaneously facing challenges such as a changing climate,
   depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion
   and loss of productivity due to the occurrence of extreme weather
   events. Precision Agriculture emerged out of the advances in the 1980s
   because of the development of several key technologies like GPS and
   satellite imagery. This paper argues that with the increasing impact of
   climate change, the next revolution in precision agriculture and
   agriculture in general will be driven by Sustainable Precision
   Agriculture and Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs), which could
   leverage past technologies combined with Big Data analysis. This new,
   technology-focused SPAE transitions from a site-specific management
   focus to the notion of global sustainability. To accomplish this
   transition, we introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing
   principle that connects local, site-specific data generators called
   smart farms to a regional and global view of agriculture that can
   support both the agricultural industry and policymakers in government.
   This will help integrate databases located in networks of networks into
   a system of systems to achieve the needed SPAE management and connect
   field, watershed, national, and worldwide sustainability. Automation and
   the use of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT),
   drones, robots, and Big Data serve as a basis for a global ``Digital
   Twin,{''} which will contribute to the development of site-specific
   conservation and management practices that will increase incomes and
   global sustainability of agricultural systems.},

Abstract = {The digital transformation (DT) is the acquiring the digital tool,
   techniques, approaches, mechanism etc. for the transformation of the
   business, applications, services and upgrading the manual process into
   the automation. The DT enable the efficacy of the system via automation,
   innovation, creativities. The another concept of DT in the engineering
   domain is to replace the manual and/or conventional process by means of
   automation to handle the big-data problems in an efficient way and
   harness the static/dynamic system information without knowing the system
   parameters. The DT represents the both opportunities and challenges to
   the developer and/or user in an organization, such as development and
   adaptation of new tool and technique in the system and society with
   respect to the various applications (i.e., digital twin, cybersecurity,
   condition monitoring and fault detection \& diagnosis (FDD), forecasting
   and prediction, intelligent data analytics, healthcare monitoring,
   feature extraction and selection, intelligent manufacturing and
   production, future city, advanced construction, resilient
   infrastructure, greater sustainability etc.). Additionally, due to high
   impact of advanced artificial intelligent, machine learning and data
   analytics techniques, the harness of the profit of the DT is increased
   globally. Therefore, the integration of DT into all areas deliver a
   value to the both users as well as developer. In this editorial
   fifty-two different applications of DT of distinct engineering domains
   are presented, which includes its detailed information,
   state-of-the-art, methodology, proposed approach development,
   experimental and/or emulation-based performance demonstration and
   finally conclusive summary of the developed tool/technique along with

   Digital Twins Manufacturing System},
Journal = {CHINA COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Pages = {138-148},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To realize high-accuracy physical-cyber digital twin (DT) mapping in a
   manufacturing system, a huge amount of data need to be collected and
   analyzed in real-time. Traditional DTs systems are deployed in cloud or
   edge servers independently, whilst it is hard to apply in real
   production systems due to the high interaction or execution delay. This
   results in a low consistency in the temporal dimension of the
   physical-cyber model. In this work, we propose a novel efficient
   edge-cloud DT manufacturing system, which is inspired by resource
   scheduling technology. Specifically, an edge-cloud collaborative DTs
   system deployment architecture is first constructed. Then, deterministic
   and uncertainty optimization adaptive strategies are presented to choose
   a more powerful server for running DT-based applications. We model the
   adaptive optimization problems as dynamic programming problems and
   propose a novel collaborative clustering parallel Q-learning (CCPQL)
   algorithm and prediction-based CCPQL to solve the problems. The proposed
   approach reduces the total delay with a higher convergence rate.
   Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the approach,
   which would have great potential in dynamic and complex industrial
   internet environments.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) came into
   being. IIoT connects sensors, industrial equipment, products, and staff
   in the factory, enabling context-awareness and industrial equipment
   automate control. The identity resolution system is a core
   infrastructure in IIoT. Similar to the role of Domain Name System (DNS)
   on the Internet, it is the entrance to the IIoT. The difference between
   them is their input and output. The input of the identity resolution
   system in IIoT is an identifier of an object. And the output is the
   mapping data attached to the identifier, including the product profile,
   a URL, or the identifier's surrounding environment. However, how to
   deploy an identity resolution system in IIoT has not yet been
   conclusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the
   potential identity resolution systems that may be used in IIoT. Firstly,
   an overview of the identity resolution system is introduced, including a
   reference framework that can be used to evaluate an identity resolution
   system. Then we review some influential identity resolution systems
   based on this reference framework. After that, we make a comparison from
   the perspective of whether they can meet IIoT requirements and
   technology selection. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives
   are discussed.},

   of data exist in the digital world today. By 2020 the data generated per
   second for every human being will approximate amount to 1.7 megabytes
   and the volume of data would double every 2 years thus reach the 40 ZB
   point by 2020. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by the
   end of year 2020, the e-commerce transactions B2B and B2C will hit 450
   billion per day on the internet.
   The advent of Big and real time Data has triggered disruptive changes in
   many fields and the exploding volume of different sources of data like
   heterogeneous data, data integration, spatio-temporal correlation of
   data, batch analytics and real-time analytics, data sharing, semantic
   interoperability requires the development of a scalable platform that
   can fuse multiple data layers to handles the data intelligently.
   In Big Data approaches, the challenge is not anymore to collect the
   data, but to draw valuable conclusions by properly analyzing them. The
   growth in Unstructured Data generated by business is irrefutable and
   they are under more pressure to preserve it for longer periods of time.
   To be clear, exploiting the collected data has been always considered by
   practitioners and researchers, but the huge velocity, heterogeneity and
   enormity of massive stream of real-time data shove the limits of the
   current storage, management and processing capabilities.
   Admittedly, the traditional method of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)
   are challenged and cannot be applied on the emerging opportunistically
   and crowed sensed data streams. Some of these data streams are
   structured in a way that serve only one predefined purpose and cannot be
   directly used for other means. Yet, there are emerging unstructured data
   such as context-based data from the internet and social media as well as
   credit card transactions that is not clear if they can be used to better
   understand the mobility patterns.
   The analytical company Gartner states that by 2020 there will be over 26
   billion interconnected devices. It is obvious, that they will produce
   massive amounts of meaningful data. Those data can be used for many
   applications such as real-time industrial equipment monitoring, traffic
   planning, automated maintenance, etc. Therefore, it is essential to
   develop modern system abstractions that allow us to resourcefully
   process huge and new data streams. This enormous amount of data urges
   the growth of integrated and insightful big and real-time data analytics
   Platforms.
   The upcoming contemporary technology like digital twin, integrates
   historical data from past machine usage to the current data. It uses
   sensors to collect the real-time data, working status and other
   operational data attached to the physical model. These components send
   the relevant data via a cloud-based system to the other side of the
   bridge with the help of data analytics platform which produces the
   required insights. The big and real-time data analytics Platforms assist
   to perform useful operations on data analytics as a complete package.
   For this purpose, data analytics platform are used to acquire
   constructive insight from the huge volume of data.
   Data analytics platform is an ecosystem of technologies and services
   that can help the businesses in increasing revenues, enhance operational
   efficiency, stabilize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts,
   respondmore quickly toemerging market trends and gain a competitive edge
   over rivals. The data analytics platform finds the pattern and
   relationships in data by applying statistical techniques and
   communicates the results generated by analytical models to executives
   and end users to make decisions with the help of data visualization
   tools that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real
   time as new information becomes available. Big data and real-time data
   analytics platform supports the full spectrum of data types, protocols
   and integration to speed up and simplify the data wrangling process. The
   big data and real time platform provides accurate data, increase
   efficiency in the workspace, gives answers to complex questions along
   with security and hence it plays the key role in business analytics.},

Abstract = {The Blockchain is a novel technology with a wide range of potential
   industrial applications. Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and
   proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of
   Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the
   interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with
   Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in
   both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with
   distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity
   that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular:
   interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be
   guaranteed by design.
   This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic
   and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless
   applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an
   industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern
   and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors.
   Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering
   paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been
   designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios.
   Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between
   industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of
   immutable and trust-less ``digital twins{''} for industrial IOT
   applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Data Normalization Technique for Detecting Cyber Attacks on UAVs},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The data analysis subsystem of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) includes
   two main modules: a data acquisition module for data processing and a
   normalization module. One of the main features of an adaptive UAV
   protection system is the analysis of its cyber-physical parameters. An
   attack on a general-purpose computer system mainly affects the
   integrity, confidentiality and availability of important information. By
   contrast, an attack on a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), such as a UAV,
   affects the functionality of the system and may disrupt its operation,
   ultimately preventing it from fulfilling its tasks correctly.
   Cyber-physical parameters are the internal parameters of a system node,
   including the states of its computing resources, data storage, actuators
   and sensor system. Here, we develop a data normalization technique that
   additionally allows us to identify the signs of a cyber-attack. In
   addition, we define sets of parameters that can highlight an attack and
   define a new database format to support intrusion detection for UAVs. To
   achieve these goals, we performed an experimental study of the impact of
   attacks on UAV parameters and developed a software module for collecting
   data from UAVs, as well as a technique for normalizing and presenting
   data for detecting attacks on UAVs. Data analysis and the evaluation of
   the quality of a parameter (whether the parameter changes normally, or
   abrupt anomalous changes are observed) are facilitated by converting
   different types of data to the same format. The resulting formalized CPS
   model allows us to identify the nature of an attack and its potential
   impact on UAV subsystems. In the future, such a model could be the basis
   of a CPS digital twin in terms of security. The presented normalization
   technique supports processing raw data, as well as classifying data sets
   for their use in machine learning (ML) analyses in the future. The data
   normalization technique can also help to immediately determine the
   presence and signs of an attack, which allows classifying raw data
   automatically by dividing it into different categories. Such a technique
   could form the basis of an intrusion detection system for CPSs. Thus,
   the obtained results can be used to classify attacks, including attack
   detection systems based on machine learning methods, and the data
   normalization technique can be used as an independent method for
   detecting attacks.},

Abstract = {In the last century, the automotive industry has arguably transformed
   society, being one of the most complex, sophisticated, and
   technologically advanced industries, with innovations ranging from the
   hybrid, electric, and self-driving smart cars to the development of
   IoT-connected cars. Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement
   of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing
   systems, cyber-physical systems, or augmented reality. One of the latest
   technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain,
   which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability,
   accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness,
   and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a
   higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review
   analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the
   automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the
   applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the
   state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges.
   Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since
   the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and
   medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new
   business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it.
   Finally, after strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
   analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding
   researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry
   developments.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Zero Defect Manufacturing is a disruptive concept that has the potential
   to entirely reshape the manufacturing ideology. Building on the same
   quality management philosophy that underpins both lean production and
   Six Sigma, the Zero Defect Manufacturing paradigm has in recent years
   developed significantly, given the onset of Industry 4.0 and the
   increasing maturity of its digital technologies. In this paper, we
   review contemporary advances in Zero Defect Manufacturing using
   structured literature review. We explore emergent themes and present
   important directions for future development in this continuously
   emerging field of research and practice. We highlight two specific Zero
   Defect Manufacturing strategy types: defect prevention, and defect
   compensation; as well as identify two important themes for future ZDM
   research, namely advancing ZDM research (particularly with a view to
   progressing from zero-defect processes to zero-waste value chain
   strategies) and overcoming the global application challenges of ZDM
   (with emphasis on cyber-security and the extension of defect prevention
   and compensation strategies to less explored manufacturing processes).

   dubbed I4.0 marks the fourth in the Industrial Revolution that focuses
   heavily on interconnectivity, automation, autonomy, machine learning,
   and real-time data. By 2020, it is estimated that over 30 billion of the
   world's devices will be connected in some waywhich is 20 billion more
   devices than today! The consistent capturing and transmitting of data
   among machines provide manufacturing companies with many growth
   opportunities. The IIoT is expected to transform how we live, work and
   play. The number one challenge faced by the Industrial IoT is security
   and privacy. If we cannot alleviate many of the security and privacy
   issues that impact the Industrial IoT, we will not be able to achieve
   its full potential. IoT and the trend toward greater connectivity means
   more data gathered from more places, in real time, to enable real-time

Abstract = {With the concepts of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing gaining
   popularity, there is a growing notion that conventional manufacturing
   will witness a transition toward a new paradigm, targeting innovation,
   automation, better response to customer needs, and intelligent systems.
   Within this context, this review focuses on the concept of
   cyber-physical production system (CPPS) and presents a holistic
   perspective on the role of the CPPS in three key and essential drivers
   of this transformation: data-driven manufacturing, decentralized
   manufacturing, and integrated blockchains for data security. The paper
   aims to connect these three aspects of smart manufacturing and proposes
   that through the application of data-driven modeling, CPPS will aid in
   transforming manufacturing to become more intuitive and automated. In
   turn, automated manufacturing will pave the way for the decentralization
   of manufacturing. Layering blockchain technologies on top of CPPS will
   ensure the reliability and security of data sharing and integration
   across decentralized systems. Each of these claims is supported by
   relevant case studies recently published in the literature and from the
   industry; a brief on existing challenges and the way forward is also
   provided. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of

Title = {Digital Twins for Managing Health Care Systems: Rapid Literature Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background: Although most digital twin (DT) applications for health care
   have emerged in precision medicine, DTs can potentially support the
   overall health care process. DTs (twinned systems, processes, and
   products) can be used to optimize flows, improve performance, improve
   health outcomes, and improve the experiences of patients, doctors, and
   other stakeholders with minimal risk.
   Objective: This paper aims to review applications of DT systems,
   products, and processes as well as analyze the potential of these
   applications for improving health care management and the challenges
   associated with this emerging technology.
   Methods: We performed a rapid review of the literature and reported
   available studies on DTs and their applications in health care
   management. We searched 5 databases for studies published between
   January 2002 and January 2022 and included peer-reviewed studies written
   in English. We excluded studies reporting DT usage to support health
   care practice (organ transplant, precision medicine, etc). Studies were
   analyzed based on their contribution toward DT technology to improve
   user experience in health care from human factors and systems
   engineering perspectives, accounting for the type of impact (product,
   process, or performance/system level). Challenges related to the
   adoption of DTs were also summarized.
   Results: The DT-related studies aimed at managing health care systems
   have been growing over time from 0 studies in 2002 to 17 in 2022, with 7
   published in 2021 (N=17 studies). The findings reported on applications
   categorized by DT type (system: n=8; process: n=5; product: n=4) and
   their contributions or functions. We identified 4 main functions of DTs
   in health care management including safety management (n=3), information
   management (n=2), health management and well-being promotion (n=3), and
   operational control (n=9). DTs used in health care systems management
   have the potential to avoid unintended or unexpected harm to people
   during the provision of health care processes. They also can help
   identify crisis-related threats to a system and control the impacts. In
   addition, DTs ensure privacy, security, and real-time information access
   to all stakeholders. Furthermore, they are beneficial in empowering
   self-care abilities by enabling health management practices and
   providing high system efficiency levels by ensuring that health care
   facilities run smoothly and offer high-quality care to every patient.
   Conclusions: The use of DTs for health care systems management is an
   emerging topic. This can be seen in the limited literature supporting
   this technology. However, DTs are increasingly being used to ensure
   patient safety and well-being in an organized system. Thus, further
   studies aiming to address the challenges of health care systems
   challenges and improve their performance should investigate the
   potential of DT technology. In addition, such technologies should embed
   human factors and ergonomics principles to ensure better design and more
   successful impact on patient and doctor experiences.},

Title = {Blockchain-Enabled IoT-BIM Platform for Supply Chain Management in
   Modular Construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Configuring a trustworthy Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled building
   information modeling (BIM) platform (IBP) is significant for modular
   construction to ensure transparency, traceability, and immutability
   throughout its fragmented supply chain management. However, most current
   IBPs are designed adopting a centralized system architecture, which
   fails to achieve a decentralized and effective one to ensure a single
   point of truth in BIM and prevent a single point of failure in IoT
   networks. To address this challenge, this study introduces permissioned
   blockchain with IBP and proposes a novel service-oriented system
   architecture of blockchain-enabled IoT-BIM platform (BIBP) for the
   data-information-knowledge (DIK)-driven supply chain management in
   modular construction. First, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is
   designed with hardware, core technologies, and protocols to offer
   accurate data from daily practice to blockchain BIM. Blockchain BIM as a
   service (BaaS) is then developed within the permissioned blockchain to
   ease the interoperability of the information, semantics, and meaningful
   inferences. Furthermore, software as a service (SaaS) is configured with
   decentralized applications to achieve knowledgeable operations or
   processes with a crash fault-tolerant consensus mechanism. The
   demonstrative case study in a modular student residence project
   evaluates the proposed BIBP system prototype with the performance
   analysis of storage cost, throughput, latency, privacy, and feedback
   from stakeholders. The results indicate that BIBP has an effective
   system architecture with acceptable throughput and latency, can save
   storage costs to achieve a single point of truth in BIM, and avoid a
   single point of failure for IoT networks with privacy and
   security-preserving mechanisms.},

Title = {Blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart modular integrated construction},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) has been one of the most
   innovative solutions to address the ever-growing housing demands in
   megacities such as Hong Kong. MiC offers a range of benefits including
   cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for
   construction industry. Multiple stakeholders in MiC project, such as
   project client, module manufacturer, logistics company, and building
   contractor, normally use their own proprietary and centralized
   Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, stake-holders are facing
   challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. ``Islands of
   Information{''} issue is commonly existing and creates information
   fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards
   and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P
   framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the
   information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper
   proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to
   facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple
   sta-keholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical
   roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and
   application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines.
   Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are
   analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is
   designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity
   digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that
   MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress
   traceability, and real-time KPI visualization \& evaluation, but also
   improves the in-formation reliability, immutability, and transparency in
   MiC projects. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Working at an oil and gas facility, such as a drilling rig, production
   facility, processing facility, or storage facility, involves various
   challenges, including health and safety risks. It is possible to
   leverage emerging digital technologies such as smart sensors, wearable
   or mobile devices, big data analytics, cloud computing, extended reality
   technologies, robotic systems, and drones to mitigate the challenges
   faced by oil and gas workers. While these technologies are not new to
   the oil and gas industry, most of its existing digital transformation
   initiatives follow business or process-centric approaches, in which the
   critical driver of the technology adoption is the enhancement of
   production, efficiency, and revenue. As a result, they may not address
   the challenges faced by the workers. As oil and gas workers are among
   the essential assets in the oil and gas industry, it is vital to address
   the challenges faced by these workers. This paper proposes a
   human-centric digital transformational framework for the oil and gas
   industry to deploy existing digital technologies to enhance their
   workers' health, safety, and working conditions. The paper outlines the
   critical challenges faced by oilfield workers, introduces a system
   architecture to implements a human-centric digital transformation,
   discusses the opportunities of the proposed framework, and summarizes
   the key impediment for the proposed framework.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Featured Application Blockchain-powered IoT Applications, such as
   agricultural applications, logistics, and smart factory data management.
   Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for
   constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT
   networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain
   network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart
   factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread
   of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks
   guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network
   maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However,
   IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic
   configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it
   impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network.
   A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical
   transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning
   framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper
   spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework
   determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN
   determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The
   discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of
   transactions to the destination node. In addition, the proposed
   trustworthy transaction spreading was implemented over an InterPlanetary
   File system (IPFS). The IPFS-powered experiments confirmed the
   practicability of the proposed transaction spreading mechanism.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Intelligence is conceived as an emerging networking
   paradigm, which will make intelligence as easy to obtain as information.
   This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Intelligence,
   focusing on motivations, architecture, enabling technologies,
   applications, and existing challenges. This can provide a good
   foundation for those who are interested to gain insights into the
   concept of the Internet of Intelligence and the key enablers of this
   emerging networking paradigm. Specifically, this paper starts by
   investigating the evolution of networking paradigms and artificial
   intelligence (AI), based on which we present the motivations of the
   Internet of Intelligence by demonstrating that networking needs
   intelligence and intelligence needs networking. We then present the
   layered architecture to characterize the Internet of Intelligence
   systems and discuss the enabling technologies of each layer. Moreover,
   we discuss the critical applications and their integration with the
   Internet of Intelligence paradigm. Finally, some technical challenges
   and open issues are summarized to fully exploit the benefits of the
   Internet of Intelligence.},

   Study of Collision Avoidance},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {89318-89336},
Abstract = {The rapid development and implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the engineering and manufacturing
   field have embraced a virtual identity to ensure nearly real-time
   adjustment. Warehouses are challenged to reassess its order fulfillment
   operations while simultaneously being provided with the opportunity to
   develop its own cloud-based CPS with the aid of IoT devices. Robotic
   Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is a system controlling mobile robots,
   mobile storage rack, putaway and picking workstations, charging
   stations, and wireless communication infrastructure in the context of
   robotic-assisted warehouse. This paper addresses the value creation
   utilizing cloud-based CPS in RMFS. By providing an analysis of cloud
   services and IoT enhancement, theoretical concepts from the literatures
   are consolidated to solve the research que-stions on how RMFS offering
   better order fulfillment can gain benefits in terms of operational
   efficiency and system reliability. The paper also proposes a cloud-based
   CPS architecture, providing a comprehensive understanding on conflict
   avoidance strategy in the multi-layers multi-deeps warehouse layout.
   This research presents six conflict classifications in RMFS and provides
   a case study in the real-life context. Dock grid conflict is a new type
   of conflict appearing in multi-deeps RMFS. A scenario analysis with real
   customer orders is applied to present the collision detection and
   solution.},

Abstract = {Research in industry 4.0 is growing, driven by the innovations in
   production systems on a continuous basis. In this study, we identified
   the evolution of themes inherent in the industry 4.0 using a
   bibliometric software, namely SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software
   Tool). The analyses included 1882 documents, 4231 keywords, and the
   relevant information was extracted based on frequency of co-occurrence
   of keywords. The clusters were plotted in two-dimensional strategic
   diagrams and analysed using the bibliometric indicators such as the
   number of publications, number of associated documents, and h-index. The
   results revealed that 2017 had the largest number of publications.
   Expert authors in the field and the periodicals that published the most
   were identified. The science mapping presented 31 clusters in which the
   most representative motor themes were CPS (Cyber-Physical System), IoT
   (Internet of Things), and Big Data. In addition, it was possible to
   identify fields with high investment of efforts by the scientific
   community such as the union between lean production and industry 4.0,
   production-centered CPS (CPPS), IoT (Industrial Internet of Things -
   IIoT), among others. The overlapping map showed an increase in the
   number of keywords from 338 to 1231 over the period of data. The map of
   scientific developments supported by an exhaustive research, it was
   possible to show the state of the art, the main challenges and
   perspectives for future research in the field of industry 4.0 such as
   Technology, Collaboration/Integration, Management and Implementation.},
