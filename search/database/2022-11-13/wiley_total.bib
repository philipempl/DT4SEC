abstract = {Abstract Due to the fierce competitive global market, enterprises need to face and overcome new challenges and requirements to stay ahead of competition. Cyber-physical systems, Internet of things, and digital twins are some of the contemporary technologies that are used in the context of Industry 4.0 in order to instill intelligence into the industrial sector by changing traditional manufacturing to smart manufacturing. The digitalized and interconnected nature of Industry 4.0 creates new security, privacy, and safety challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to be fully realized. This study presents an overview regarding the use of digital twins as a means to reinforce and secure cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0, in general. Digital twins connect the physical and virtual worlds and can be used in combination with other technologies to provide several merits in various sectors, such as real-time monitoring and controlling, prompt access to dynamic data, constant visualization and analysis, process optimization, advanced decision-making, and prediction systems. All in all, based on the literature review, digital twins can constitute an essential tool for the realization, reinforcement, and security of cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {Summary Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are hybrid systems comprising multiple components and many other combinations of various integrated but heterogeneous computational and physical capabilities. Todays embedded system such as iPhones and smart watches have integrated hardware and software solutions. There are engineering methodologies available to develop such embedded systems, focusing on the system. While their use at a personal level is much understood, what is less understood, and a topic of ongoing research is the question of what happens when such systems are deployed across multiple sectors, such as intelligent transportation systems, Internet of Things, smart medical devices, and many more, and used in activities not originally intended by the designers, for example, controlling the physical devices such as an automobile or an electricity power generation plant. This cross-sector deployment and the collective use of such systems introduces risk at the macro-system level that may have cascaded impacts in a highly networked environment, which further impact the constituent systems themselves. This is a major problem. One possibility to reduce the technical risk is to remotely control the systems in the cyber environments, but the sheer number of variables and possible situations introduce complexity at multiple scales. This complexity results in test plans with limited coverage. Additional cyber physical system related issues of intelligence, adaptation, autonomy, and security make the problem even worse. The proposed solution is the enhanced use of Modeling and Simulation (M\&S). The M\&S discipline has supported the development of complex systems since its inception. This chapter provides an overview on the M\&S methods and technologies that aid CPS engineering in the development and testing phases, and CPS governance when they are deployed in complex cyber environments.}

Taking the advantages of digital twin on near-real-time interaction between the physical and cyber systems, the framework, operation, and enabled technologies of digital twin smart freeway (DTSF) are developed in this paper. A three-layer conceptual framework is first discussed for understanding the fundamental structure, core components, and operation procedure of a DTSF system in the context of smart transportation. The key technologies of a DTSF system are also investigated, such as simulation modelling, big data analysis, intelligent prediction, and integrated freeway control. Moreover, a well-designed case study based on Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed freeway control strategy by integrating perimeter control of upstream urban network and traffic regulation of freeway segments. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to investigate integrated freeway control under the framework of digital twin.}

In this chapter, the authors describe a bachelor-level curriculum offered at the University of Warwick (UK) and a masters-level curriculum implemented at the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer (Germany). Aiming to bridge the gap between the realization of Industry 4.0 and educational organizations, the Warwick Manufacturing Group at the University of Warwick developed a degree apprenticeship in Digital Technology Solutions, providing specialization in three pathways (software engineering, data analysis and network engineering) in a four-year program. The key enabling technologies and key enabling features of the Master Industrial Informatics with Specialization in industrial cyber-physical systems are first a study body composed of two major graduate programs and, second, the use of a Digital Factory for learning digitalization through hands-on practical training.}

abstract = {Summary The ongoing global digital transformation, inspired by the Industry 4.0 initiative, has brought new concepts and emerging technologies. The digital twin (DT) technology is one of these innovative notions that has recently gained more attention. The DT idea attempts to allow smart factories by providing a link between real and virtual systems and digital reproduction or representation of the physical system. The data is gathered, analyzed, and fed into the simulated virtual model in order to forecast and enhance the physical system's performance. However, there are a number of obstacles to overcome in the development of the technology, including data analytics and data privacy. This article focused on the potential and challenges of DT technology that should possess in Industry 4.0. Exploration of the DT in the context of Industry 4.0 will aid future research and development.}

During the past decades, there were major changes in the energy industry: the increased implementation of renewable generation, together with a greater use of electronic power elements in the network such as high-voltage DC links and the use of flexible AC transmission system and new market requirements, introduce new challenges and a need for more intelligent assets monitoring; and additional optimisation with a better balance in the combination of different energy sources and thus guaranteeing the reliability of supply and quality of energy; together with the identification of new business models that allow the integration of new technologies, neutralising cyber threats and ensure an adequate dissemination of knowledge to new generations. Companies are migrating to a more digital model based fundamentally on three pillars: communications, big data and artificial intelligence. The right combination of these three pillars will optimise the operation of the electrical system, reducing costs and polluting emissions, accelerating the adoption of non-polluting energies and renewable energies, while maximising economic performance and a closer way of interacting with users. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has been identified as one of the technologies with most potential impact in the next years.},

Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.},

abstract = {Abstract An observed increase in systems scale and complexity has led to a significant momentum in exploring, identifying, and adopting model based systems engineering (MBSE) tools and techniques amongst research communities and industry practitioners. Several attempts to transform systems design and engineering practices through the use of MBSE in academia and industry has led to a considerable increase in the number of articles published containing the keyword “MBSE.” This growth serves as the motivation in this paper to explore the MBSE landscape with the help of text mining techniques to identify the most often used key terms, tools, and languages, in the context of research in MBSE and the thematic aspects defining the use of MBSE by researchers and practitioners. The objective of this paper is to provide a structured comprehensive overview of research contributions across the MBSE landscape by employing text mining techniques for: (a) identifying the concepts and methodologies inferred upon in relation to MBSE, and (b) classifying the literature published to identify commonalities across academic researchers and practitioners using MBSE tools and methods. For this purpose, the abstracts of 2380 relevant articles published in the period of the last two decades from five different databases are mined. It is found that the terms “SysML,” “Cyber Physical Systems,” and “Production” are the most used terms among researchers across the MBSE landscape with SysML being the most widely used modeling language. Further, six major thematic topics are identified that classify articles from over the last two decades with an increasing interest observed in the use of MBSE to support manufacturing and production engineering activities, especially in the cyber physical systems domain. The contributions of this paper provide a leeway on using text mining techniques to understand the research directions that are currently of interest in the field of MBSE and thereby identify potential future research directions.},

abstract = {Summary In this chapter, the authors focus on the design and evaluation of industrial cyber-physical systems that will be interacting or even cooperating with a human operator. Since they are dealing with systems dedicated to Industry 4.0, these human operators are called Operators 4.0. The designer must thus identify the tasks and sub-tasks of the human operators and the Human–Industrial Cyber-Physical System (HICPS) at each level of activity, also known as the decision-making level, such as the operational, tactical and strategic levels regularly mentioned in industrial systems organizations. The definition and organization of the functions of the human operators and the HICPS are important steps in the design process, but the design of the interface, external representation of the Common Workspace, and thus support of the cooperative activity are also a crucial step to the success of the new HICPS.}

abstract = {Abstract In this work, we present a cloud-based digital twin for monitoring of a clamping technology for machining of composite parts. Supporting large and/or freeform composite parts is crucial to avoid bending during drilling. Bending of the part will lead to delamination and frayed edges of the drilled holes. The new active clamping technology allows to realise a stabilised fixture, localised in the area where the drilling occurs, to avoid bending. This significantly improves the quality of the drilled holes. The clamping device is equipped with an IoT edge device, with a bidirectional communication to the cloud. The cloud-based digital twin analyses the quality of the drilled holes based on computer vision, monitors the drill wear and detects incorrect operation of the active clamping device. All data is stored in the cloud. By means of a knowledge graph, which acquires and integrates information into an ontology and provides a central information access, it will be easier for a data scientist to query this data and to gain new insights in the operation of the drill with active clamping device. The full deployment occurs on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This transforms the standard machine into an Industry 4.0 compliant machine.},

abstract = {Summary P3 is a petri dish brimming with questions, not answers, but suggestions, to explore. The aim is not to teach or pontificate but may swing the proverbial pendulum between science and engineering in the context of commercial and consumer services. The reader may ponder about the amorphous questions or wonder in confusion. We disrupt the status quo and indulge in orthogonal, nonlinear, and asymmetric information arbitrage which may not be correct. This is a seed, sterile unless cultivated. We aspire to inform that tools and data related to the affluent world are not a template to be “copied” or applied to systems in the remaining (80\%) parts of the world which suffer from economic constraints. We need different thinking that resists the inclination of the affluent 20\% of the world to treat the rest of the world (80\% of the population) as a market. The 80/20 concept evokes the Pareto [1] theme in P3 and the implication is that ideas may float between (porous) the 80/20 domains (partition).}

abstract = {Abstract Industry 4.0 refers to the digital transformation in the manufacturing domain through new technology. Currently, it expands well beyond manufacturing, affecting many areas of life and posing implications for all types of business. This paper focuses on the relationships between Industry 4.0 and Healthcare which transitions to increased interconnectivity, automation and smart decision making. The integration context of Industry 4.0 into Healthcare is only partly understood. Little was done until now to consolidate what is known on the integration benefits and the challenges. This article reports results of a systematic mapping study that analysed 69 papers to extract knowledge about the concepts of Industry 4.0 and the emerging Healthcare 4.0., and the relationships between them. We found 10 different perspectives of Healthcare 4.0, ranging from strategic to tactical and operational levels. Next, our results show: (i) nine applications of Industry 4.0 in the Healthcare domain: Augmented Reality and Simulation, Autonomous Robotics, Cybersecurity, Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing and Systems Integration; and (ii) 10 benefits and nine challenges in Healthcare 4.0. The most frequently mentioned benefits are patients' diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and financial benefits. The most researched challenges are data fragmentation, heterogeneity, complexity, and privacy.}

Changes can include: change in user needs; system mission changes; competition and teaming changes; and changing threat performance. Disruptions may also cause the systems engineer to adapt in the environment and workplace such as disruptions in technology, processes, and people-system interfaces. Future systems engineering efforts may be applied to different domains other than the traditional defense and aerospace projects. These include healthcare, transportation, environment, cybersecurity and Internet of Things, and manufacturing. Systems engineers may need to reconsider the traditional modality of their education. Some of these areas for consideration are core systems engineering topics, systems thinking, and the transdisciplinary development of ideas.}

In the digitalization of the economy, metrology plays a fundamental role not only in the verification and approval but also in a constant access to data and measurement any time locally or remotely to guarantee success. Digital measurements will ensure the following: eliminating manual error or inconsistency, increasing productivity, minimizing waste, and enabling greater factory automation. Several measurands can be recorded with a data acquisition system including distance and displacement, temperature, voltage, current strain, and pressure. Measurement and quantification are the basic concepts of metrology. This considers explicit and internationally accepted definitions, principles and standards. Similar to the principle of digital twin manufacturing, digital twin metrology inspection is the combination of a software model of the product as 3D CAD with semantic tolerances.}

abstract = {Abstract As the world races to respond to the diverse and expanding demands for electrochemical energy storage solutions, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) remain the most advanced technology in the battery ecosystem. Even as unprecedented demand for state-of-the-art batteries drives gigascale production around the world, there are increasing calls for next-generation batteries that are safer, more affordable, and energy-dense. These trends motivate the intense pursuit of battery manufacturing processes that are cost effective, scalable, and sustainable. The digital transformation of battery manufacturing plants can help meet these needs. This review provides a detailed discussion of the current and near-term developments for the digitalization of the battery cell manufacturing chain and presents future perspectives in this field. Current modelling approaches are reviewed, and a discussion is presented on how these elements can be combined with data acquisition instruments and communication protocols in a framework for building a digital twin of the battery manufacturing chain. The challenges and emerging techniques provided here is expected to give scientists and engineers from both industry and academia a guide toward more intelligent and interconnected battery manufacturing processes in the future.},

abstract = {Abstract Attacks on cyber-physical systems, such as nuclear and water treatment plants, have physical consequences that impact the lives of thousands of citizens. In such systems, it is mandatory to monitor the field network and detect potential threats before a problem occurs. This work proposes a hybrid approach that orchestrates unsupervised and incremental learning methods to detect threats that impact the control loops in a plant. We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90\% precision and with accuracy higher than 95\%.},

Asset management programs are based on a given set of operational parameters that were established during the implementation of the programs. The foundation for digital twin is the process operation simulation that is converted from process design simulation. The chapter discusses the concept of Asset Performance Management digital twin can be extended to cover process safety. Process safety is about managing the integrity of operating systems by identifying hazards, estimating their risk, and applying engineering safeguards and disciplined operating practices.

With the digital revolution, the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are shrinking to merge with new interactive modes between operators, machines, and products. Artificial intelligence, 3D printing, virtual reality, digital twin, blockchain, robotics, and digital technologies are transforming the means of production, organization, and business models of companies. If it is a more competitive technological revolution, bearer of numerous innovations, and creator of a new market dynamic, of possible reintegration of manufacturing in Western countries, Industry 4.0 disrupts the world of work as a whole. Indeed, it is the whole system of decision and political regulation of companies, communities, and states (and their natures) of the work relations on the part of the operators which is questioned with an obligation to get out of the processes of individualization and social misanthropy which are taking place at the moment. Transitions are therefore taking place with the search for a possible combination of classical aspects with the immense potential of digital technologies.}

abstract = {Summary The industrial revolution cannot be separated from the social system and from the freedom granted to people, to entrepreneurs to invest in companies that involve capital, and therefore risks. Capitalism in the financial sense plays a fundamental role. This chapter discusses the first, second, third, and fourth industrial revolutions. The fourth industrial revolution originates from the increased power of computers that follow Moore's law stipulating that their power doubles every 18 months. Artificial intelligence (AI) is based on machine learning, which itself includes deep learning. Deep learning utilizes algorithms called artificial neural networks. The transition to digital technology and AI has brought in its wake a number of digital tools and methods that have changed the landscape of the company and its means of production. The digital twin makes it possible to move from curative and preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance.}

This chapter examines the latest digital approach to the oil and gas industry that is the enabler to connected metering. Connected metering is digital transformation that is emerging for Industrial Internet of Things in which ubiquitous connectivity is coupled to cloud-borne data analytics and storage systems in enhancing metering accuracy and reliability. Metering has seen a tremendous growth since its early introduction in the 1800s in terms of both technology and market size. Connectivity is that enabled by the digital economy and its ubiquitous connectivity. Condition based monitoring is largely operating within the oil and gas industry as a stranded asset and typically for ultrasonic meters. A positive-unexpected consequence of collecting data within a digitization strategy is that further subsets of data may be readily formed from the larger master data sets bringing about new insights.}

abstract = {Summary The uses of Internet of Things (IoT)–based devices are increasing in the world by people, and life without such smart devices becomes impossible these days. The essential of human being has been increasing day by day and, along with the improvements in IoT, has led to demand on evolving platforms like edge computing and fog cloud. Here, we can define cloud computing terms as follows: “Cloud computing service was initially proposed due to small works in industries (to reduce the number of computer system in an organization), but later, it was implemented on a large scale”. Today, major companies like IBM and Amazon are providing such efficient services of the cloud to consumers (or millions of customers world-wide). When comes to company side of cloud computing, they actually prefer resources that are in the form of utility such as Virtual Machine (VM) and other applications, and some services involve cloud storage, hybrid cloud intelligence, and applications. Mainly, these services are classified into three main groups such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). These services are explained in this chapter in detail.}

abstract = {Summary The terms Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing (SM) are widely used today in industry, academia, and the consulting world to describe a major industrial transition underway. This transition is truly revolutionary in that it is now possible to create a digital twin of physical operations to improve operational efficiency and safety while fostering the automation of repetitive, labor-intensive, and dangerous activities. Manufacturing before the Industrial Revolution was typically a cottage enterprise with small shops producing leather goods, clothing, harnesses, and so on. The Second Industrial Revolution began in the United States, England, and Europe with the introduction of electrical power over a grid, real-time communication over telegraph, and people and freight transportation over a network of railroads. The Third Industrial Revolution began in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of the first electronic computers.}

abstract = {Abstract We present an approach to decision support in cybersecurity with respect to cyber threats and stakeholders' requirements. We approach situations in which cybersecurity experts need to take actions to mitigate the risks, such as temporarily putting an IT system out of operation, but need to consult them with other stakeholders. We propose a decision support system that uses a mission decomposition model representing the organization's functional and security requirements on its IT infrastructure. Based on the cybersecurity state assessment, that is, discovery of vulnerabilities and attacker's position, the decision support system calculates the resilience metrics for each IT infrastructure's configuration, that is, how likely are they to not be disrupted. The calculation is enabled by two novel formal models, Privilege-Exploit Attack Graph and Bayesian Privilege Attack Graph, which reduce complex attack graphs into a comprehensible bipartite graph. Moreover, they illustrate the impact of exploiting the vulnerabilities and attackers gaining the privileges. The system recommends the most resilient mission configurations that are comprehensible to both cybersecurity experts and non-technical stakeholders, who may then choose which configuration to apply. Our approach is illustrated in a case study of a real-world medical information system.}

abstract = {Summary The transition to an intermittent energy production from renewable energy sources (RES) increases the complexity of providing reliable energy supply in Germany. Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.},

abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, many complex multi-vendor production environments, such as telecom infrastructures in smart cities or on-board passenger information systems in trains, are based on micro-services and deployed in the cloud. From a service integrator viewpoint, building new solutions for these environments, which can host a large number of externally designed and developed micro-services, is often complex and error-prone. This is in part due to undocumented behaviour or undocumented architectural specifications of such systems. Advanced service monitoring can offer a solution to quickly detect anomalies or unexpected service interaction behaviour during on-site integration. However, the monitoring service should not have an impact on the production environment itself. Therefore, this article proposes an agent-based unobtrusive monitoring platform, capable of monitoring both internally developed and externally developed services through the use of sidecar containers. It monitors state, metrics and network traffic at micro-service level and the research was conducted as part of the DynAMo research project, a collaboration with various industry partners. Prototype evaluation proves that our solution has a negligible impact (below 0.02\% CPU usage on average) on an existing micro-service environment just as other monitoring systems like Prometheus while offering additional functionality focused on multi-vendor service integration. This makes it suitable to be deployed in complex production domains to further aid on-site integration and quickly find potential new anomalies.},

abstract = {Abstract A systems perspective of an emergent field such as Industry 4.0 requires combining and analysing the entire multidisciplinary scholarship under one map. Recent developments in scientometric analysis allow researchers to carry out complex bibliometric analyses coupled with an unstructured ontological discovery made available through thematic and ensuing semantic analyses to gain a holistic outlook on the ecosystem of Industry 4.0. The state-of-the-art review of the entire scholarship of Industry 4.0 demonstrates three broad clusters—the implications of automation on industry, the integration of technologies and technological advancements driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The scholarship output is, for the first time, compared with the leading industrial and policymaking institutional reports to highlight similarities and discrepancies. This allows to propose a previously unavailable definition of Industry 4.0, which is much needed to progress the research further. The three highly discrepant areas between academic literature and industry insights include lack of research into return on investment, lack of research involving policymaking, and the implications of technological development on the workforce, firms and countries. It is imperative to drive research into the existent, as well as the highlighted, themes in advancing the knowledge and aligning the academic scholarship with the interests of practitioners.},

The creation, protection, exchange, valorization, enrichment and monetization of intangible assets all come up against obstacles in the form of three categories of systemic asymmetries: trust and security asymmetries, information and control asymmetries, and revenue and recognition asymmetries. The original Bitcoin protocol, called proof of work, aims to prevent malicious people from attacking the Bitcoin network by forcing them to use their computing power to prove their contributions to the network. Private protocols, such as proof of authority, are more “human centered” and can achieve a much lower carbon footprint. The augmentation convergence of the Bio, Phy and Digital worlds is based on the AugmentChain propelled by three “pyramidal” engines, the enablers, the catalysts and the outcome that work together in short cycles.}

The digital transformation should strengthen the competitiveness of commercial enterprises, while enabling desirable ways of working at the same time. The digital transformation is an opportunity to shed some light on the role of the human individual in digital manufacturing and the business development potential of a human-centered work design. Measures taken to adapt work to people refer to technical-ergonomic conditions and/or to substantive-organizational conditions of the work activity. Immersion, that is, complete immersion in the virtual world by means of head-mounted displays or projections, addresses as many human senses as possible, in order to achieve a realistic simulation. The digital transformation is changing human work and workload patterns.}

abstract = {Abstract Research on Reconfigurable Battery Systems (RBS) is gaining emphasis over the traditional fixed topology of the battery pack due to its advantages of adapting flexible topology (series-parallel) during its operation in the pack for meeting the non-linear time-dependent load requirements. There could emerge serious issues such as those related to safety due to malfunction of the switching circuit, heat generation from switches during frequent switching of circuits, charging temperature rise, increased charging time, sensing issues arising from the use of low-accuracy voltage/current sensors, state of charge/state of health estimation, and cost issues due to the use of increasing number of switches, fuses, contactors, relays, circuit breakers etc. To address these mentioned issues, the problem of optimal switching circuit topology for RBS is formulated as a mathematical multi-objective optimisation problem. An intelligent system framework based on digital twins is proposed. The proposed framework is further extended to a life cycle management approach that includes the interactions among pack design, pack assembly and operational and recycling levels. This could provide greater access of real-time big data cloud storage to the battery designers, manufacturers and recycling industries, who can make use of it to optimise their designs, systems and operations.},

We build on network-based models of platform growth to characterize configurations of digital and physical supply chain infrastructure. We define cross-platform effect as the value accrued by a platform on one side of a multiplatform configuration as capability for the opposite side platform evolves. We posit that aligning cross-platform effect across digital and physical infrastructure enhances system outcomes. Our arguments are informed by evidence on private–public partnerships for developing production and distribution infrastructure in the pharmaceutical industry. We identify enablers and inhibitors for cross-platform effects within these data in terms of product and process technology readiness, path-dependent standards creation, organizational alignment, regulatory fragmentation, and the desire towards such infrastructure yielding resilient outcomes. Implications of findings, in shaping analytical and empirical research on managing supply chain infrastructure, at the levels of firms, industries, and public policies are discussed.}

abstract = {Summary This chapter studies the cloud security issues in network forensics and a large-scale machine-to-machine (M2M) communication impact on the fourth industrial revolution. The parameters help to gather, analyze, and document information about incidentals security and network-based crime activities. It also supports the solving of a complication related to the network traffic in the cloud, virtual machine dynamic migration, virtual resources of cloud clients, provides an environment like multi-tenancy, does not infringe on the security and protection of other cloud users, and most important, avoids transferring costs of large sets of data and processed directly. Cloud security and M2M communication permit the discovery of the best conceivable security configuration, improve communication, self-monitoring, and diagnose cloud security issues without the need for human intervention. Restrictions and crucial points are emphasized to arrange for initial forensics investigations and also further studies in this area. This chapter presents a model that is generic in nature for network forensics in the cloud environment as well as defines prototype artifact that articulates the M2M communication security issue that impacts on fourth industrial revolution application. We validate the architecture prototype with an implementation based on the OpenNebula Hypervisor web-based interface and the NetworkMiner analysis framework.}

abstract = {Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated for more than 60 years. With the development of computing power, innovative algorithms, and gathering of massive data, AI will be rejuvenated in the next decade and become one of the most important enabling technologies for 5G automation. How to use the powerful analysis, judgment, and prediction capabilities provided by the AI algorithms to enable 5G equipment, networks and service systems, and combine them with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of carriers' networks become an important topic in the ICT industry. Based on deep understanding, accumulated experience in telecom field, and long-term investment in AI strategies, many organizations have been introducing AI technology to telecom networks and contributing to development of standards essential for improving the quality and security of AI products and services, ensuring user safety and creating a fair and open industry ecosystem. 5G networks can be automatically deployed (automatic service deployment and automatic running) with the introduction of AI based on application scenarios. AI algorithms can also be used for self-healing (automatic fault recovery), self-optimization (network self-optimization) and creating autonomous 5G systems (self-evolving networks), which continuously improve network efficiency and reduce OPEX. This article aims at presenting the most relevant use cases, prominent research outcomes, latest standard developments and related standardization gaps, examples of AI strategy interpretation, AI solutions – including communication intelligent platform, AI model service, and deployment solution – and typical application scenarios. As a part of this framework, this article introduces the most important aspects of AI security, in terms of protecting the integrity and confidentiality of AI models and data, and thus preventing attackers from changing the inference results or stealing data.}

This study provides the results of a brief investigation of the main factors that contribute the success of DT and demonstrates the value of using technology roadmapping alongside systems engineering (SE) practices to create a path between identified “AS-IS” and “TO-BE” operational states. Applying SE methods to the adoption of the “T-Plan” roadmapping process resulted in a strategic communication tool that can be used among stakeholders to support them with the integration of business planning and technology adoption, and to help assess the impact that new technologies may have on their organizations in their journey toward a successful DT. In addition to the roadmap itself, which benefits the case company, this study contributes to building and enriching academic literature by providing insight from the oil and gas industry and demonstrating the use of technology roadmapping to create a strategic plan for DT in a well-established industrial domain.},

The process industry has many targets that may be attractive to cybercriminals. Depending on their motivation, attackers will target different components on the process control system. Unlike cybersecurity incidents on IT systems, which tend to result almost exclusively in economic consequences, OT cybersecurity incidents can create a number of potential consequences, depending on the objectives of the attacker. The chapter provides a summary of information that should be considered when updating a process safety consequence severity table to apply to cybersecurity risk assessment.}

ML is the study in which a machine is trained with past data and examples and uses algorithms to build the logic. Important ML applicationsare speech recognition, computer vision, bio-surveillance, robot or automation control, empirical science experiments, DNA classification, intrusion detection, astronomical data analysis, information security, transportation, etc. According to a recent survey, computer-generated insurance advice is helpful to customers. Using ML, determination of cover for a certain customer can be predicted. Choice of the mode of transportation can also be benefited from ML. ML predicts the mode of transportation for an individual to make their travel better. Travel modes may include private car, public transport (bus or train), or soft mode (walking or cycling). The very first step in applying ML is to define a problem. This step includes three important processes to be considered, namely, problem identification, the motivation behind problem solving, and the solution itself.

abstract = {Summary This chapter provides information related to practical experiences and the latest developments and innovations of substation design using gas-insulated substation (GIS). It explains the effects and influences of insulation coordination and the reasons for studies are given. The chapter examines the health and safety impact of GIS and also explains very fast transient voltages and transient enclosure voltages for GIS. It describes the decomposition by-products of SF 6 and handling procedure. Most of the GIS equipment is shipped from the factory assembled and filled with positive SF 6 gas pressure or dry nitrogen. The GIS manufacturers follow the environmentally conscious design process, described in IEC 62430. Insulation coordination is the basic criteria for the reliability of the GIS. The grounding of the GIS is the most important protection against overvoltage stress. The very fast transient overvoltage generated internally within the GIS could become incident on externally connected apparatus.}

abstract = {Abstract Business process management (BPM) provides many benefits for a company including productivity, efficiency, compliance, risk management, consistency, repeatability, and measurability. Many of these aspects also ensure and improve functional safety, privacy, and security in process execution. However, managed business processes lack flexibility; ie, changing a business process requires more effort than ad hoc execution and adaptation. Thus, especially in small companies, the acceptance rate of managed business processes is low. So we claim that in current BPM approaches, the structuredness ensuring functional safety and security concepts contradicts with the objective for flexibility. The main goal of the AdaBPM project is to address this contradiction by providing a formal approach to handle advanced adaptations and exception handling in business processes. The technical objectives of the project include (1) the definition of a basic framework being capable of handling different levels of adaptivity and considering security and safety requirements at the same time, (2) a rigorous process specification language and model refinement methods, (3) static business process adaptations, and (4) dynamic (or ad hoc) adaptations. The result of our research is a general approach for flexible BPM combined with the possibility to nevertheless manage the process and define safety and security restrictions.},

This chapter focuses on digitalization technologies and how they are going to shape the digital world. In short, digitization will substantially enhance our decision-making capability in our personal as well as professional lives. Data centers armed with a large number of server machines, storage appliances, and networking solutions are bound to consume a lot of electricity and dissipate more heat into the fragile environment. The physical and digital versions are integrated in order to be constantly in touch to communicate the real-time and runtime data of physical machines. Digital transformation is the buzzword these days. It is believed that real digital transformation results in the much-needed business transformation.}

abstract = {Abstract Principles of Industry 4.0 direct us to predict how pharmaceutical operations and regulations may exist with automation, digitization, artificial intelligence (AI), and real time data acquisition. Machine learning (ML), a sub-discipline of AI, involves the use of statistical tools to extract the desired information either through understanding the underlying patterns in the information or by development of mathematical relationships among the critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of biopharmaceuticals. ML is still in its infancy for directly supporting the quality-by-design based development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals. However, adoption of ML-based models in place of conventional multi-variate-data-analysis (MVDA) is increasing with the accumulation of large-scale data. This has been majorly contributed by the real-time monitoring of process variables and quality attributes of products through the implementation of process analytical technology in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. All aspects of healthcare, from drug design to product distribution, are complex and multidimensional. Thus, ML-based approaches are being applied to achieve sophistication, accuracy, flexibility and agility in all these areas. This review discusses the potential of ML for addressing the complex issues in diverse areas of biopharmaceutical development, such as biopharmaceuticals design and assessment of early stage development, upstream and downstream process development, analysis, characterization and prediction of post-translational modifications (PTMs), formulation, and stability studies. Moreover, the challenges in acquisition, cleaning and structuring the bioprocess data, which is one of the major hurdles in implementation of ML in biopharma industry, have also been discussed. Regulatory perspectives on implementation of AI/ML in the biopharma sector have also been briefly discussed. This article is a bird's eye view on the recent developments and applications of ML in overcoming the challenges for adopting “Industry – 4.0” in the biopharma industry.}

They potentially will bring a radical change to real world operations. In this study, we first explore several major disruptive technologies, examine the corresponding OM studies, and highlight their current applications in the industry. Then, we discuss the pros and cons associated with the use of these technologies and uncover the potential human–machine conflicting areas. After that, we propose measures which may be able to achieve human–machine reconciles in the coming Industry 5.0 era. A concept of “sustainable social welfare” which includes worker welfare, privacy, etc. is proposed and the roles played by policy makers are also discussed. Finally, a future research agenda, which covers topics in both the Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 eras, is established.},

abstract = {Abstract Digital manufacturing technologies (DMTs) have the potential to transform industry productivity, but their introduction into the workplace is often a complex process, requiring not only technical expertise but also an awareness of ethical and societal challenges surrounding human–system integration. Concerns about the introduction of new technology have been prevalent throughout history, and exploring public perceptions of these technologies can provide insight to help address such cultural anxieties. However, evaluating user perceptions of futuristic technology is difficult, requiring novel approaches to provide context and understanding. To explore users' perceptions of future DMTs, we applied the ContraVision technique in a questionnaire-based study. Participants viewed films, representing fictionalized utopic and dystopic visions of what the future of these DMTs might involve, and a questionnaire probed the perceptions of the technologies afterward. Findings showed that irrespective of the way technology was portrayed, participants had concerns about the ethical and responsible implementation of these tools. Participant responses were analyzed to identify key challenges for policy surrounding DMT implementation in the future of manufacturing.}

abstract = {Summary Extended reality (XR) technologies are rapidly morphing together with Industry 4.0 cyberphysical twins, and multi-user games and game-engine developers' software, into a concept called the metaverse, enabled by the advancements of a breadth of graphics technology, including game engines, augmented reality (AR) wearables, real-world scans, and virtual reality (VR). The future XR metaverse runs on top of the internet backbone, similar to the world wide web, and connects and decentralizes AR and VR spaces and experiences. Whether this will be an open immersive network for entertainment, education, enterprise collaboration, group-gaming, and social gatherings, or a one-world walled garden, the XR metaverse will have to be built collaboratively by many developers and organizations, because it is to huge to be built by one organization alone. It has to be built in coordination, in order to make things interoperable, and the only way to achieve this is through collaboration and openness to create a shared innovation ecosystem. Open standards and open source are essential elements of the future of XR, enabling the future XR metaverse, which is so huge, and the implications of widespread adoption are so influential that we must create it together in cross-disciplinary, international collaboration and stay vigilant to mitigate the inherent risks to privacy and security.}

abstract = {Abstract Digital technology is regarded as providing a promising means of moving production and consumption towards the circular economy. However, it is still unclear which functions of digital technologies are most useful to improving circularity, and how these functions could be used to enhance different circular economy strategies. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic literature review. After examining 174 papers, creating 782 original codes and 259 second-round codes, the study identifies 13 critical functions of digital technologies which are most relevant to circular economy strategies. The paper then proposes a framework which reveals seven mechanisms of how these digital functions can enhance different circular economy strategies. The framework also reveals which combinations of the digital functions and circular economy strategies have already been studied extensively as well as where there may be gaps. This indicates which digital functions are more mature in terms of possible implementation for circular economy as well as what missing links there are in the empirical and theoretical research. The study advances the synergies between digital technologies and the circular economy paradigm through the lens of digital functions. The proposed framework and mechanisms build a theoretical foundation for future research, and we highlight five research areas for further studies. This study also provides a structured way for managers to explore the appropriate digital functions for their CE strategies, so as to identify required digital technologies and new value creation through digital functions.},

The main purpose of edge computing is to describe an area as the technical landscape “over the Internet”. Edge computing extends the ability of devices to work in disconnected situations or deliver services without being fully dependent on online resources. It a key driver for the Internet of Augmented Me (I.AM). The chapter illustrates some characteristics of business cases in order to explain how to look at these business cases from an edge computing point of view. Edge computing contributes to end-to-end solutions, and transforms the I.AM into a responsive, personalized and omnipresent service. Edge computing is an essential component in the user experience, fully seamless through all the “smart everything technologies” and the collaborative models.}

abstract = {Abstract This study contributes to state-of-the-art circular business strategies (CBSs) for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) by designating the critical indicators since the advent of I4.0 and demonstrating the business challenges and opportunities for the global development of circularity-based operations. Social media big data-driven analysis is used to compare geographical regions, and suggestions are made to promote CBSs among regions. CBSs for I4.0 are receiving increasing attention, but a holistic viewpoint and an understanding of the indicators influencing their effective and successful implementation in each region are still lacking. To fill this gap, this study aims to determine the definitive CBS indicators for I4.0 and their opportunities and challenges across regions. As an enormous amount of multisource information is obtained from capitalizing on social media data analytics, firms can adopt social media data-driven analysis, including content analysis, normal distribution tests, and the entropy weight method, to detect opportunities and challenges connected with the transformation to a CBS for I4.0. There are 28 validated indicators from the original set of relevant hashtags. The results show that the top indicators with a high level of difference among world regions selected for further discussion include waste management, vanguard leadership, deep learning, strategy execution, and collaboration. The findings of this study are a reference for decision-makers to determine a suitable direction for CBS implementation, thus gaining sustainable competitive advantages.}

Smart Manufacturing will bring automation on a number of technological fronts and to all types of manufacturing. Life on the factory floor has changed dramatically since the early days of the Industrial Revolution, when unhealthy and dangerous working conditions were the norm. Equipment was prone to breakdowns and fires with few safety protocols. Smart Manufacturing will only be successful with skilled and dedicated workers on the factory and distribution floor. Fictional artificial intelligence dominates the way the general public perceives the possibilities and potential pitfalls of machine learning applications. It is important to understand the three major roles mentioned earlier that will be needed in Smart Manufacturing: service, application, and operator. The chapter also presents three types of tools needed in smart manufacturing: process tools, process control tools, and handling tools.}

In particular, the research shows the training program on the assessment model and its practical application conducted by students in one company from the region of Tuscany. The knowledge transfer process to support companies in understanding their Industry 4.0 maturity level can be one way through which higher education institutions can support the business environment. Companies can support students in translating such knowledge in best practices and concrete solutions that can be valuable for growing the professional profile of the students themselves, and for developing the company's processes and business models.}

It draws on an empirical investigation into location awareness and the politics of spatial data, which explored both end-user and industry/government perceptions of location-based services and the digital platforms providing them. In keeping with the focus on contentions of the software-sorted city, the chapter discusses three broad themes: big data versus thick data, data privacy, and data sovereignty. Big data and advancement of analytical tools to make sense of these data create the illusion of knowing everything about everyone, specifically in regards to urban development and smart cities. Pioneering good data practices is significant as many jurisdictions across the world embrace both national smart city strategies and a data-driven economy.}

abstract = {Summary The profession of project management has been changing and fast. Companies that thrive on competitive bidding for a large portion of their revenue stream, such as with project-driven organizations, promote their delivery system as well as the outcomes or deliverables. What companies are now realizing is that the strategic focus should be on creating a high-performance organization rather than just high-performance teams. Some countries establish laws that provide limitations on how much, if any, of the financial resources that the country possesses can leave the country. Companies that wish to do business within these countries must abide by these laws even if the laws seem improper. Sustainable strategic project management success requires a cooperative culture where team members work together and make decisions in the best interest of the firm. Projects are becoming clear strategic change and transformation vehicles. The chapter covers a multitude of the required dimensions of strategic agility.}

abstract = {In this chapter, the authors employ strategic foresight methods to analyze Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) within a future Dynamic Disaster Management System and consider the role Medical Examiner (MEs)/Cs offer society, particularly when everyone is experiencing a devastating disaster event. According to Ralston and Wilson, performing future trend analysis, which entails horizon scanning, provides the best means of identifying early signals of change. Following a review of megatrends, futuring involves a Forcefield Analysis to determine drivers and constrainers of change. Unlike traditional analysis, the benefit of futuring is ME/Cs can “stresstest” DVI strategies to figure out if they will work in the twenty-first century. The advantage of grouping the findings into strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat categories is that it simplifies the content and helps leaders recognize issues of greatest concern. Specific to disasters, ME/Cs will need to regularly consider new DVI strategies versus thinking past strategies will work.}
