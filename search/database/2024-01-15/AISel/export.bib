A Digital Twin describes the connection between physical and virtual objects. However, a unified definition for Digital Twins is still missing. While existing literature reviews mainly focus on the application of Digital Twins, this review is analyzing the explanations, definitions, and elements of the Digital Twins described in the literature. Based on an examination of 233 papers, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy of a Digital Twin and sorts the most common definitions. The taxonomy developed in this contribution allows classifying the various definitions and concepts of Digital Twins that emerged in literature over the years. That may help the reader to gain profound insights into the domain of Digital Twins.},

Our findings suggest that current simulation systems help inform decisions but are insufficient to prepare complex scenarios requiring coordination between multiple agents operating in extreme conditions.

Thereby, we aim to identify the factors that have an influence on the decision of vehicle manufacturers to adopt the concept of the vehicle digital twin. To unveil those factors, we conducted 30 expert interviews at two vehicle manufacturers in which we found benefits and barriers regarding the realization of a product digital twin. By conceptualizing the benefits and barriers, which have a positive or negative influence on the adoption decision from the perspective of the manufacturers, we were able to derive general influences on the adoption decision. In our adapted technology-organization-environment framework we found influences in the technological (i.e. product data and product heterogeneity), the organizational (i.e. business model orientation, readiness of internal processes and digital culture) and the environmental (i.e. competitors behaviour, legal regulations and customer demand) dimension.},

DTs are information systems that connect the physical and virtual worlds. The design of DTs is time-consuming, expensive, and lacks appropriate prescriptive design knowledge for its development. Design principles (DP) represent a mechanism to codify design knowledge into prescriptive knowledge. However, the mostly abstract DPs are often difficult for practitioners to operationalize during software development projects, rendering the design knowledge difficult to access. The paper at hand addresses these issues by providing a reference model for DT development as a semi-abstract artifact. The model has been constructed by drawing on a literature review and empirical cases in the manufacturing industry. The reference model includes multiple adaptation mechanisms to ensure a flexible development of company-specific DTs.},

Drawing on a structured literature review, we derive new conceptualizations of DTs as (i) virtual mirrors that depict a physical entity and its interactions in virtual space, and (ii) virtual orchestrators which extend the virtual mirror by also simulating potential virtual interactions. These new conceptualizations, by applying them to human DTs, enable us to discuss DT’s implications to approach current CX potentials.

	abstract = {Smart service systems are a network of people, technologies, as well as processes and rely on learning, adaptivity, and decision-making to provide smart services to their users. The complexity of designing smart service systems results in a plethora of potential implementation obstacles, often leading to an overly technical focus and resulting in isolated solutions. There is, therefore, a need for a guideline for companies that helps them facilitate the development of complex smart service systems. To this end, we apply action design research used in a multi-year design study for digital twins in the manufacturing industry. The resulting four-quadrant framework (domain, system design, organization, and ecosystem) can help researchers and companies guide the development of smart service systems or evaluate past progress. The evaluation of the framework shows that there might be dominant quadrants and certain paths in the framework, which we would like to investigate in further research.},

Along with the rise of organizational sustainability strategy (OSS), the role of information systems (IS) in sustainability has increased and become a source of sustainability at the organizational level. Although ever more companies consider sustainability a top priority, they struggle to turn sustainability strategies into practice and observe measurable results. We followed a mixed methods approach combining qualitative interview data (n=13) and quantitative data from a multi-continental industry survey (n=551) to generate an in-depth understanding of the role of IS-enabled sustainability practices in influencing the organizational sustainability strategy-implementation gap. With our study, we demonstrate that IS-enabled sustainability practices mediate the impact of OSS on organizational sustainability performance (OSP) and that these practices are enabled by IS capabilities that are critical to implementing sustainability practices (technology intelligence, data analysis, and digital twinning capability).},

However, today’s aging built environment often poses great environmental demands to older adults’ mobility and causes their distresses. To better understand and help mitigating older adults’ distress in their daily trips, this paper proposes constructing the digital twin city (DTC) model that integrates multimodal data (i.e., physiological sensing, visual sensing) on environmental demands in urban communities, so that such environmental demands can be considered in mobility planning of older adults. Specifically, this paper examines how data acquired from various modalities (i.e., electrodermal activity, gait patterns, visual sensing) can portray environmental demands associated with older adults’ mobility. In addition, it discusses the challenges and opportunities of multimodal data fusion in capturing environmental distresses in urban communities.},

	abstract = {The goal of the paper is to expose the pillars of urban digital infrastructure and their role in the development of smart and data driven applications in the e2e model. Today, no one contests the need for a general-purpose infrastructure in the city that improves the quality of life with respect to various types of socio-economic activity of residents. However, the digital aspect of fostering this kind of activity is linked to a very dynamic and ubiquitous element of technology, and the quality and stability of solutions based on advanced technology is a key parameter of the quality of life and development that a city should provide to its residents. This pace of technology development means that our environment (including cities) are subject to a process of continuous digital transformation. Starting from examples of such transformation and top-trends in technology development, we focus on transformation pillars that can ensure sustainable growth of innovation supply in a city. We give three examples of platforms designed for City of Poznan. We conclude that a key factor benefiting this multidimensional transformation process is the provision of an open, data-transmission and processing infrastructure with the support of which all smart city stakeholders can pursue their social, scientific, economic, or political goals in a sustainable manner.},

Steps from the BPM lifecycle were applied to a farming use case in Germany. First, the as-is business process model was discovered and modeled without DTs, analyzed and then redesigned into the to-be model according to the DT integration. The to-be model showed a reduction in the number of tasks needed to be performed by the farmer as well as an improvement of process data quality, interoperability, and efficiency. Finally, a comparison of the' average processing times of both models with the help of process simulation revealed improvements in the to-be process.},

Therefore, this paper develops a cloud computing taxonomy that is theoretically grounded by performing a structured literature review and empirically validated by conducting workshops with participants from industry and science. By describing the most important dimensions and characteristics of cloud computing in detail and by applying the taxonomy using three large cloud providers, we aim to give the reader a holistic overview of the cloud and demonstrate the relevance of cloud computing for digital innovation.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things acts as a seed for enterprises to collaborate and create new value. This value creation is often concentrated in big enterprises that command large amounts of resources. The craft sector’s small and medium sized enterprises struggle to adopt such new technologies. Lacking resources and in-house capabilities, they increasingly rely on services provided by large enterprises. Collaboration among equals can offer an alternative path for these small and medium sized enterprises. Combining their strengths in an IoT-ecosystem is one way to overcome these limitations. We conducted a case study in the electrical engineering craft to build such an IoT-ecosystem. Participating organizations planned how to develop the existing ecosystem into an IoT-ecosystem. This process was observed to be structured into a status quo and three sequential phases. Our research shows, that sharing data can act as the initial phase to unlock new value in an existing ecosystem. Every enterprise can then work on connecting its clients’ systems to enable an eventual opening to join the IoT-ecosystem. This three-phased approach offers enterprises a tool to work towards an IoT-ecosystem. Researchers can apply the three-phased approach as an analytic tool to reason about progress towards an IoT-ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to propose and test a graph-based approach for detection of critical infrastructure disruptions in social media data in disasters. Understanding the situation and disruptive events of critical infrastructure is essential to effective disaster response and recovery of communities. The potential of social media data for situation awareness during disasters has been highlighted in recent studies. However, the application of social sensing in detecting disruptions of critical infrastructure is limited because existing approaches cannot provide complete and non-ambiguous situational information about critical infrastructure. Therefore, to address this methodological gap, we developed a graph-based approach including data filtering, burst time-frame detection, content similarity and graph analysis. A case study of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 in Houston was conducted to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. The findings highlighted the temporal patterns of critical infrastructure events that occurred in disasters including disruptive events and their adverse impacts on communities. The findings also provided insights for better understanding critical infrastructure interdependencies in disasters. From the practical perspective, the proposed methodology study can improve the ability of community members, first responders and decision makers to detect and respond to infrastructure disruptions in disasters.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, health-care organizations rely extensively on information technology and systems for providing high-quality services to their patients and exchanging data with external partners. However, these organizations, processes, and operations are vulnerable to criminal activities and digital security breaches, which has led health-care organizations to build various protection mechanisms, including firewalls, virus scanners, and security policies that enhance their ability to prepare for threats; design activities to be conducted during a cyberattack; and implement means to recover from an unfortunate event. Although these moves have been acknowledged in research and in practice, there is still little knowledge available on how organizations understand and perceive such events as well as their consequences. To this end, we conducted a qualitative case study that included 14 interviews with diverse key actors at a Finnish hospital. From them, we aimed to understand how the organization has prepared for cyberattack resilience. By generalizing our case research, we built a framework for analyzing and improving organizational resilience. This framework makes significant contributions both to theory and practice.},

According to a report published on the website of the Spanish newspaper "The Economist", the metaverse is one of the most important technology trends in 2022. From the listing of Roblox on NASDAQ in the United States as the "first Metaverse stock", to the creation of a " Metaverse city" in Seoul, and then to the "inter-temporal interviews of Metaverse" conducted at the two sessions of the National Assembly in China. The discussion on metaverse has gradually expanded from the interpretation of the concept to the possibilities of related applications, and has shown a trend of diversification in terms of topics and subjects. Although metaverse research has become a popular research field in academic circles at home and abroad for less than a year, with the joint efforts of many scholars in many disciplinary fields at home and abroad, academic research on metaverse has made considerable progress with some innovative research findings. Metaverse is moving from conceptual construction and theoretical exploration to the rapid development stage of practical exploration and industrial application in parallel. From the perspective of the current situation of metaverse research, this paper systematically compares the hot spots of metaverse research at home and abroad, and on this basis, prospectively thinks about and explores the future trend of the integration and development of metaverse and smart cities, in order to provide some theoretical reference and inspiration for the current research of metaverse and smart cities.},

To ensure that information and advisories are taken up seriously, it is important for PIs to be perceived as a trusted source and a trustworthy point of contact. In this study, we therefore examine how CAs can be applied by PIs to, on the one hand, automate their crisis communication and, on the other hand, maintain or even increase their perceived trustworthiness. We developed two CAs – one equipped with ethical cues in order to be perceived more trustworthy and one without such cues – and started to conduct an online experiment to evaluate the effects. Our first results indicate that applying ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, security and accountability have a positive effect on the perceived trustworthiness of the CA.},

This study focuses on the potential risk of metaverse addiction and considers the influencing factors from the perspective of technology affordance and virtual reality compensatory effect. Mainly, we identify metaverse affordances based on key characteristics (i.e., accessibility, immersion, spatiotemporality, sustainability, interoperability, and scalability). It also highlights two kinds of affordance actualization factors (i.e., escapism and digital perfectionism) that arise from virtual reality compensatory theory. The research model suggests that metaverse affordance is actualized through compensation, ultimately forming reliance behavior like an addiction. This conceptual research potentially contributes to further investigation of the dark side of the metaverse and provides insights into research considering the compensatory effects to mitigate potential risks and ensure the healthy development of the metaverse.},

However, unlike the actual deployment of digital technologies in various industries, the domain of conceptual modeling itself has not yet undergone a comprehensive renewal in light of digitization. Therefore, inspired by the notion of Industry 4.0, an overarching concept for digital manufacturing, in this commentary paper, we propose Modeling 4.0 as the notion for conceptual modeling mechanisms in a digital environment. In total, 12 mechanisms of conceptual modeling are distinguished, providing ample guidance for academics and professionals interested in ensuring that modeling techniques and methods continue to fit contemporary and emerging requirements.},

	abstract = {To stay competitive, automotive manufacturers need to foster product and business model innovation. Key to this is a tight integration of customers into product and business model development. Current approaches to customer integration are mostly based on market research that only considers customers' intention to use. These approaches neglect the potential of actual usage data for guiding the cost-intensive product and business model development. This paper develops a method to utilize customer usage data to determine parking scenarios that can guide automotive manufacturers to develop customer value-oriented parking assistance functions. The approach was evaluated on 22 million parking global positioning system (GPS) positions in Germany. Our findings help classify different types of parking behavior that automotive manufacturers can use to allocate development resources for parking assistance functions and minimize parking search traffic by providing live forecasts of on-street parking utilization and peak periods. This also enables future on-demand business models.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/globdev2021/1},
	abstract = {The SARS-CoV19 pandemic exposed a broad spectrum of challenges for modern cities, societies and the environment at large. The post-Covid transformation requires new social, ecological and educational solutions, adjusted to modern challenges, but also equipped with technological advances that allow for digital inclusion and sustainable urban development to benefit the local economy and society. Many information systems designed to enable pro-environmental behaviours are being tested or implemented worldwide, mostly in developed countries; however, most of them focus on a sectorial approach only. On the other hand, community currencies (CCs) consider social, economic, and environmental issues yet do not fully exploit the potential of the current technological advancement. Therefore, the paper describes the process of defining the theoretical framework for Greencoin as an information system designed to be a supportive tool while shaping urban adaptability and mitigating climate change, within which a CC is embedded. The 120 social currencies and information systems (IS) analysed in this research provide valuable data that is essential to shaping the framework of the Greencoin IS, to be implemented in the subsequent stages of the project. Greencoin IS aims to operate based on an application, the work resulting from studies of existing solutions, their functionalities and technological aspects, which enable social engagement and eco-inclusion. It responds to the question of how the new types of currencies and applications enriched with gamification elements can encourage residents to get involved in shaping urban resilience. This research goal is to build a future framework for Greencoin IS based on the performed systematic literature review and case studies.},

In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate the integration of data and analytics as an analytical unit into the field of Service Innovation – referred to as Data-Driven Service Innovation (DDSI). Overall, the SLR reveals three main research perspectives that span the research field of Data-Driven Service Innovation: Explorative DDSI, validative DDSI, and generative DDSI. This integrated theoretical framework describes the distinct operant roles of data analytics for Service Innovation, and thus contributes to the body of knowledge in the field of DDSI by providing three unified lenses, which researchers can use to describe and locate their existing and future research endeavors in this ample field. Building up on the insights from the SLR, a research agenda is proposed in order to trigger and guide further discussions and future research surrounding DDSI. Ultimately, this paper aims at contributing to the body of knowledge of Service Innovation in general and Data-Driven Service Innovation in particular by presenting a three-dimensional research space model structuring DDSI towards its advancement.},

Where tokenization may disrupt our economic system leading to more efficiency or democracy, it is required to gain insights and facilitate the development of use cases associated with this concept. To illustrate how firms can apply tokenization to innovate their businesses, we propose a framework of different token properties, drivers, and barriers for adoption based on literature and expert interviews and present eight archetypical cases derived from an analysis of 129 ventures. This work provides strategic guidance in a token economy and a starting point for future research of viable applications.},

However, the adoption of ImT by manufacturing SMEs is still low. Drawing on the Technology Affordances and Constraints theory, and applying a Strategy-as-Practice approach, this study researches the adoption of ImT as a strategic response to environmental changes in German-based manufacturing SMEs. The findings reveal the critical role of constraints of ImT, which act as hindrances to implementation. Specifically, realizing the affordances of ImT requires consideration of, and responses to, the constraints manufacturing SMEs experience, including the constraints associated with the providers of ImT. Thus, this paper expands the understanding of the factors which influence implementation and strategizing of ImT in SMEs.},

This paper aims to focus on identifying challenges that pose knowledge risks and pos-sible actions to overcome them. Particularly, the focus is on knowledge risks emerging out of an organizational and technical perspective. These risks can also act as a barrier for technology adaption in industry, hence it is important to provide an overview of existing research, synthesize it with one another, and translate it to unexplored gaps. Therefore, a structured literature review is conducted. It is found that challenges are often related to topics of data security, data analytics, training, and trustful relation-ships.

The assessment of a software tool is influenced by different orientations and functionalities, e.g., for pure BM representation or simulation. This contribution provides a procedure for systematically assessing BMI tools and offers an overview of existing BM tools as well as their support for BMI and a related transformation process. The results show that early phases of BMI are well supported, while later phases are hardly represented. A possible reason for this lies in the complexity of later BMI phases. First steps towards supporting later phases through software are discussed.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies and their uptake in society have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in history. However, research into how the public sector uses digital innovation has been slow to develop. Government has an essential role to play in sustainability by setting and enforcing policies around subjects such as pollution and carbon taxes, making digital innovation in government critical for digital sustainability. Further, the public sector’s values and priorities differ from those of the private sector, which confounds simple comparisons in areas such as digital ways of working and efficiency drivers. This paper draws on the public management literature and uses an exploratory and interpretive field study of a leading digital government. The research identifies six barriers to digital innovation within the New South Wales government, a world-leader in digital integration. The barriers are: varying digital maturity, non-digital mindset, slow mobilization, service-based silos, premature solutioning, and failure to align investment in digital innovation with broader government priorities. The paper identifies initiatives enabling world-class digital innovation and driving effective change. These enablers are structural service integration, ecosystem engagement, technology modernization, customer-centric strategies and processes, and agility in management. This paper finds that digital capability gaps and core rigidities interact requiring a comprehensive approach to realize the significant benefits offered to citizens and the environment.},

Interoperability has proven effective in addressing scalability by offloading transactions via bridges, enhancing flexibility and portability for, e.g., tokens. As a result, we investigate how interoperability is organized in blockchain systems and what implications it might bring. In this research, we develop an on-ledger analytics prototype, which facilitates the examinations of NFT bridges and theorizes about the dimensions of interoperability. Practical implications reveal that hiding a token’s track in an otherwise supposedly transparent system is possible. We provide evidence that current research may only consider a subset of a token’s history among blockchain systems. Ultimately, we claim that interoperability among blockchain systems can lead to decreased transparency.},

The business model of those platforms introduces transaction costs for users. Additionally, these platforms often create lasting dependencies, lack transparency, and therefore trust. At the same time, new technologies such as blockchain emerged, which promise to solve these various issues by enabling decentralized transactions. This paper uses a design science research approach to develop an infrastructure for decentralized collaborative manufacturing. Therefore, we matched requirements for existing platform approaches to decentralizing technologies. To evaluate the approach, we conducted expert interviews to verify the usefulness and assess potential improvements to extend existing research dimensions of collaboration systems.},

To harness the potential of blockchain technology, sports management practitioners and information systems (IS) researchers need to gain a much better understanding. Hence, the purpose of this study is to advance the theoretical understanding of blockchain in the sports sector. Thereby, we identify, consolidate, and classify blockchain use cases in the domain through a thorough review of the literature published to date. In addition, we (1) provide an overview and classification of blockchain use cases, (2) identify various opportunities for internal and external stakeholders to benefit from blockchain technology, and (3) derive a theoretical concept for blockchain technology regarding its properties, applications, and stakeholders. Furthermore, we (4) propose beneficial directions for future research in this emerging field.},

We contribute to the literature on process automation by unveiling transparent and immutable, cross-organizational, and decentralized automation as characteristics that differentiate smart contracts from established automation technologies. Besides, we provide practitioners with an understanding of application scenarios, potentials, and drawbacks of smart contracts for process automation.},

Based on a conceptualization of such situations, a lifecycle "plug-in" is proposed in the form of a methodology and associated tool support, allowing for responsive evolution of the adopted modeling method with impact on several lifecycle phases. Historical examples from the evolution of a BPM product are provided to illustrate and classify the demands that motivate the existence of this "lifecycle plug-in".},

This leads to many drawbacks such as poor visibility due to limited 2D representation, complex interaction due to indirect interaction via mouse and keyboard, or restricted support for collaboration between traders. To overcome these issues, we have developed a novel collaborative, virtual environment for stock trading, which enables stock traders to view financial information and trade stocks with other collaborators. The main results of a usability study indicate that the VR environment, compared to conventional stock trading, shows no significant advantages concerning efficiency and effectiveness, however, we could observe an increased user satisfaction and better collaboration.},

This paper presents research among civil servants, suppliers and experts who play a role in the automation of spatial policymaking and planning (e.g. environment, building, sound and CO2 regulation, mobility). The case is a major digitalisation programme of that spatial planning in the Netherlands. In this digital transition, the research assumption is that public and political values such as transparency, legitimacy and (perceived) fairness are difficult to validate in the practice of the design process; policy makers tend to lose sight of the algorithms and decision trees designed during the ICT -implementation of eGovernment services. This situation would implicate a power shift towards the system level bureaucrat. i.e., the digitized execution of laws and regulations, thereby threatening democratic control. This also sets the stage for anxiety towards ICT projects and digital bureaucracies. We have investigated perceptions about ‘validation dark spots’ in the design process of the national planning platform that create unintended shifts in decision power in the context of the legal planning process. To identify these validation dark spots, 22 stakeholders were interviewed. The results partially confirm the assumption. Based on the collected data, nine validation dark spots are identified that require more attention and research.},

	abstract = {Data ecosystems receive considerable attention in academia and practice, as indicated by a steadily growing body of research and large-scale (industry-driven) research projects. They can leverage so-called data intermediaries, which are mediating parties that facilitate data sharing between a data provider and a data consumer. Research has uncovered many types of data intermediaries, such as data marketplaces or data trusts. However, what is missing is a ‘big picture’ of data intermediaries and the functions they fulfill. We tackle this issue by extracting data intermediation services decoupled from specific instances to give a comprehensive overview of how they work. To achieve this, we report on a systematic literature review, contributing data intermediation services.},

	abstract = {Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) technology is becoming central for Information Systems (IS) research. However, existing studies in IS fall short of providing insights into how the IVR experience becomes meaningful for end-users. To increase granularity and specificity in this regard, researchers have suggested that the IVR experience can become meaningful due to its fleeting feeling of escapism. In this paper, I explore and characterize how individuals use the IVR experience to create meaning in the context of meaningful escapism, by undertaking a phenomenology inspired inquiry, based on Heideggerian views on meaning, meaningfulness, and world. Interviews and analysis were conducted within an empirical case of IVR fire safety training. As a result, four characteristics of the IVR experience as a meaningful form of escapism were unveiled: a sense of content, a sense of familiarity, a sense of mood, and a sense of care. Throughout this study, I offer a nuanced perspective on how the characteristics contribute to clarifying the distinctions and relationship between meaning and meaningfulness, as well as how the IVR experience becomes a meaningful escapism that provides an alternative of individual’s being-in-the-world, into a being-in-the-virtual-world, also known as Virtual Dasein. Further, this study contributes to the IS field by advancing the current discourse on IVR research and escapism, from a phenomenological perspective.},

Data spaces represent a relatively new phenomenon aimed at encouraging businesses to fully leverage the potential of data. Despite various approaches for definitions there remains a lack of clarity surrounding the conceptualization of data space, its perceived value, and the factors that drive its adoption. The conceptual ambiguity and synonymous usage of the term in academic and business literature present significant obstacles to targeted conceptualization and use. This paper addresses these issues by proposing primary properties of data space and contributes to the field by applying a semantic decomposition. Through this approach, we identified data space as having the following conceptual aspects Nature, Element, Function, Utility and Governance. These primitives highlight the growing need for security and privacy when sharing interorganizational data. In addition, we offer an initial definition of data spaces.},

Against this backdrop, we present a common, interdisciplinary conceptualization of DPSSs in terms of a framework for technology-driven factors, which we inferred from a systematic literature review. Our interview-based evaluation showed that such an overview is urgently needed in research and practice. Our findings represent a theory for analyzing and add to the descriptive knowledge by providing an information systems lens on personnel selection.

Thereby, digitalization develops unlimited potential in terms of innovation, connectivity, efficiency and productivity improvements. However, research and practice still lack a fundamental understanding of the nature of digital technologies. To address this gap, we developed a multi-layer taxonomy of digital technologies that includes eight dimensions structured along the layers of established modular architectures, i.e. service, content, network, and device. Based on our taxonomy, we also identified seven archetypes of digital technologies by means of a cluster analysis. To revise and evaluate our artefacts, we classified 45 digital technologies from the Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies and conducted evaluation rounds with other researchers. Our results contribute to the descriptive knowledge on digital technologies. They enable researchers and practitioners to classify digital technologies on two levels of aggregation and to make informed decisions about their adoption.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate such strategies considering all necessary dimensions of the BIM system in infrastructure construction projects. The findings are based on theoretical discussion and semi-structured interviews in a case study project in New South Wales, Australia. The results revealed that BIM integrates various elements of infrastructure construction, which include but are not limited to risk, time, cost, energy, safety, and sustainability. It was found that implementation strategies should focus on improving the contribution of the BIM system to infrastructure construction in terms of improved (1) integrity and automation, (2) collaboration, and (3) optimization. Identification of seven technical and managerial implementations strategies is the core contribution of this research. These strategies provide practitioners with insight into technical and managerial measures to be taken for the successful implementation of the BIM system.},

The what aspect includes an IA architecture that goes beyond the direct interactions between humans and machines by introducing their indirect relationships through data and domain. The architecture also points to the directions for operationalizing the IA design simplification principle.

Further, it is unclear which role the characteristics of the affected industries, firms and markets play regarding the impact that the digital transformation has on them., Method: Taking up these two challenges in a combined fashion for one of the economically most important, but also most specialized and physical global industries, we systematically review the latest literature on the digital transformation within the manufacturing context., Results: This work is the first one that provides a valid theoretical basis on the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry. Thereby, it becomes clear that this basis is severely depending on its context. In particular, we show that the manufacturing industry is special in several dimensions, mainly due to its high physicality. Many of the connected technological concepts and domains are solely applicable within that particular environment. Also, our results indicate that a notable share of manufacturing firms did not experience any or at least not big impacts by the digital transformation on the business model level but indeed heavy impacts on the process level until now. However, for our initial suspicion that the structural differences between the manufac-turing industry and other more hardware-independent industries are so far reaching as that they would even lead to definitional differences, no evidence was found., Conclusions: This study contributes to the ongoing line of activities trying to streamline the extensive research around the digital transformation and thereby especially emphasizes the importance of context in that area of research., Available at: https://aisel.aisnet.org/pajais/vol12/iss3/3/},

Rather than adopting highly abstract and complex enterprise architecture frameworks, we suggest creating easy-to-use visualizations of the enterprise architecture, the business ecosystem and related cross-layer dependencies. While transferring the discipline of enterprise architecture (EA) into the context of digital entrepreneurship, we derived four design principles helping to enrich the theoretical body of knowledge in this research area.},

Our findings reveal that users spend more time on the website and explore more pages when users can (vs. cannot) customize the quantity of ads. Most interestingly, users engage more with the website when given the possibility of AQC than when experiencing a website that is ad-free by default. Additionally, users respond particularly positively to AQC when using mobile (vs. stationary) devices. With our research, we contribute to literature on web customization and provide insightful guidance whether and how website providers can harness ad customization.},

Although gamification elements have already been reported in various IoT research, there still lacks answers about how gamification may affect user engagement in IoT systems and through what paths. In  present  work, we are synthesizing and analyzing existing research efforts in these emerging fields to provide implications for future IoE development. The results are categorized into three dimensions by considering cognitive-behavioral outcome, procedural stage and population scale.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2021/35},
	abstract = {In research, industrial case studies are a possibility to collect information about complex phenomena from the environment where they occur. Digital transformation (DT) is a complex phenomenon, but there is a paucity of published case studies which describe the intermediary steps taken in enterprise DT activities. The paper contributes to a more diversified picture of digital transformation (DT) by describing and analyzing the step-by-step transformation of five case studies. The approach proposed for planning and analysis of DT cases in small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) consists of three elements: (a) focus on the dimensions “products/services” and “operations” when initiating DT in SME, (b) use step-by-step transformation along transformation paths instead of aiming at transformation in one go, and (c) include the success factors of DT known from literature in the step-by-step approach.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/jise/vol34/iss3/4},
	abstract = {This study shares the direct experiences of designing and implementing methodological “learning-by-doing” for Action Design Research (ADR) within a 5-credit module that condenses the realities of completing a full ADR project without compromising the rigour of the approach. The module is described in detail, along with the specifics of its implementation over two years and the key learnings from doing so. Adopting a confessional writing approach, documented experiences from those involved (both designers and students) provide a rich data source, analysed using autonomous and communicative reflexivity. The underlying contribution of this paper is that it provides insights into the learning of ADR, the doing of ADR, and the outcomes of a technique that simultaneously combines both. As a result, ADR educators and researchers can draw on these insights to further their teaching, learning, and research endeavours. Finally, key insights such as forced pragmatism and the challenge of problematisation add to our understanding of conducting ADR while avoiding issues such as methodological slurring.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2022/58},
	abstract = {Shifting to product-service systems (PSS) enables pay-per-use revenue models to positively impact social, economic, and environmental interests. However, few studies have shown how user-oriented PSS offers can be adopted in traditional sectors of the economy. This paper introduces the concept of “pay-per-sustainable-use” in construction: PSS adoption that promotes conscientious equipment use and long-term value for its stakeholders. A design science research project was conducted in a supplier of construction tower cranes aiming to redesign their product portfolio. This project shows how information systems can modernize business models toward smarter machinery for sustainable construction. For theory, we characterize the pay-per-sustainable-use revenue model using PSS. For practice, we present a pioneer case of PSS design in construction tower cranes and suggest accessible guidelines to assist construction equipment managers in selecting the best digital transformation strategy that protects people, machines, and the building environment.},

	url = {https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2021/iot_smart/iot_smart/2},
	abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) and digital platforms have offered industrial companies new opportunities to compete against digital platform-native companies. To succeed in this competition, industry incumbents must learn to extend their traditional product and service business through platforms. However, extant research has focused primarily on the ability of platform owners to govern mature platforms for innovation but has largely ignored how industry incumbents can build these capabilities internally during the establishment of their platform ecosystems as part of larger transformational journeys. To address this gap, we conduct a multiple case study of three incumbent organizations, drawing on a dynamic capability lens. We identify 11 practical microfoundations of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities that aided three incumbents in establishing their IoT platform ecosystems. Besides the transformational activities, our findings contribute to the literature on platform establishment through three IoT-related shifts that deviate from known digital platform paradigms.},

	abstract = {Due to the pandemic, institutions of the health sector, especially public health departments, are facing major challenges in managing their processes. In a constantly changing environment, new and existing processes have to be adopted or implemented in the shortest possible time, while the process volumes to be managed are constantly increasing. In our article, we use a case study to show how the concept of “flexibility by design” can be influenced by RPA in the sensitive environment of healthcare and how exactly flexibility in process execution can be achieved with it. As a result, we show that RPA can positively implement or enable three of the six realization options from the concept. In addition, the concept was supplemented by two aggregated theoretical dimensions, namely “Response” and “Range,” which summarize the supporting conditions for a process flexibilization with RPA. In the article, we thereby show how exactly RPA can complement existing processes in a healthcare environment and thus, serve to subsequently make rigid process models more flexible.},
