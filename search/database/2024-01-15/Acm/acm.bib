abstract = {It is always uncertain to know when your favorite farm produce will be arriving on the shelves when you cannot find one at the grocery store. Most consumers simply return home and come back to the grocery store at a future date/time in anticipation that they will find the produce. However, there is no guarantee that on their return, the produce will have arrived in the store or be available on the shelves. These events can lead to disappointments, wasted travel time and effort, and cost. The goal of this paper is to enable farm produce consumers to track the location, distribution, and time when their produce will be arriving at the grocery store via a mobile application. However, there are challenges to address such as not disclosing the actual location of drivers/distributors to the public due to safety and privacy concerns. Thus, we adopted digital twin (i.e., virtual replicas of the actual location data) techniques to enhance data confidentiality. The mobile application is a distributed architecture with a cloud-based middleware server and a database. The preliminary testing of the work shows that consumers are happy with the mobile application, and the system evaluation also confirms the feasibility of deploying such a mobile product.},

abstract = {This paper is an ongoing work seeking to establish a generic definition and model of the Human Digital Twin (HDT) concept, independently from the application sector. The goal is to help researchers knowing more precisely what is or could be a HDT and an initial step step towards a unifying and generic definition and model grounded in the systemics theory. We propose a systemic model of Digital Twin (DT), where HDT is a specific class of DT. The last years of literature on HDT are reviewed, to build a generic definition, extract the main components and integrate them in a generic systemic model centred on the DT and HDT concepts as systems. Doing this, we make explicit the link between DT and the systems they twin, including the special system that is the human-being, when a DT becomes a HDT.},

abstract = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

abstract = {As drone technology passes one milestone after the other, drones are used in an ever-increasing number of applications and are now considered as an integral part of the future smart city infrastructure. At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.},

abstract = {Hybrid clouds bring together the advantages of the on-premises, private, and public cloud services. Agility, privacy, and regulatory compliance are some of the advantages of hybrid clouds. However, the key characteristics of complex hybrid cloud application such as heterogeneity, reliability, interoperability, scalability, and dynamic nature also makes old static approaches brittle. A digital twin can capture real-time (meta) data of a hybrid cloud application and supply valuable insights for efficient management of the cloud services and analyzing faults. In this paper, we propose a digital twin assisted approach to analyze the faults, interoperability, and reliability issues of a hybrid cloud-based application. We also present some metamorphic relations to analyze the reliability of our twin. Insights from the digital twin can assist developers to take proactive measures before a fault occur. The digital twin can also help detect faults and identify the cause and remediation steps through data insights. The key advantage of using digital twin is that it helps detect issues in complex hybrid cloud applications in a holistic way.},

By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.},

The development of tools that aid in integrating real-world physical systems with digital capabilities is essential for advancing digital twin technology. In this work, we present one such digital twin tool that integrates the longitudinal thermal envelope data of buildings on the campus of the National University of Singapore with a virtual 3D model. Thermal images of the buildings were captured using a neighborhood-scale infrared observatory for a few months. The temperature profile of one of the buildings was extracted and mapped on the virtual 3D model. The digital twin model is developed in the deck.gl platform. This is one of the few studies on developing a dynamic digital twin incorporating temporally and spatially varying urban-scale 2D temperature envelope data with the virtual 3D model. The digital twin platform can study the microclimate and help urban planners identify the building elements contributing to the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the neighborhood scale.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method, called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore, similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also, on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.},

From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical digital twin model framework for CPS design. In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle.

Larger and larger cities, increasingly interconnected, in search of new balances (even where “classic” surveillance tools are limited or banned), become the ideal training ground for experimenting with a new vocabulary and concepts at the basis of the governance of “native” digital communities.},

abstract = {Following the trends of electrification, the energy storage of vehicles is gaining importance as the most expensive part of an electric car. Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) path planning is one of the promising technologies in the fifth-generation wireless communications. The gap between simulation and reality limits the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in UAV path planning. Therefore, we propose a digital twin-based deep reinforcement learning training framework. With the help of digital twin, DRL model can be trained more effectively deployed to real UAVs. In this training framework, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based multi-UAV path planning algorithm. Based on decomposed actor structure in DRL, we design a pooling-based combined LSTM network to better understand different state information in a multi-UAV path planning task. Moreover, we also establish a digital twin platform for multi-UAV system, which has a high degree of simulation and visualization. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher mean rewards, and outperforms DDPG in average arrival rate by more than 30%.},

abstract = {IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like train control and management systems (TCMS), are becoming ubiquitous in critical infrastructures. As safety-critical systems, ensuring their dependability during operation is crucial. Digital twins (DTs) have been increasingly studied for this purpose owing to their capability of runtime monitoring and warning, prediction and detection of anomalies, etc. However, constructing a DT for anomaly detection in TCMS necessitates sufficient training data and extracting both chronological and context features with high quality. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel method named KDDT for TCMS anomaly detection. KDDT harnesses a language model (LM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract contexts and chronological features, respectively. To enrich data volume, KDDT benefits from out-of-domain data with knowledge distillation (KD). We evaluated KDDT with two datasets from our industry partner Alstom and obtained the F1 scores of 0.931 and 0.915, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of KDDT. We also explored individual contributions of the DT model, LM, and KD to the overall performance of KDDT, via a comprehensive empirical study, and observed average F1 score improvements of 12.4%, 3%, and 6.05%, respectively.},

In the case of the Pohang Earthquake, the ground is losing its resistance and the ground liquefaction phenomenon that is behaving like a liquid is officially reported. In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.},

However, it is still difficult to construct a relationship between twin simulation and a real scenario considering dynamic variations, especially when dealing with small surface defect detection tasks with high performance and computation resource requirements. In this article, we aim to construct cyber-manufacturing systems to achieve a DT solution for small surface defect detection task. Focusing on DT-based solution, the proposed system consists of an Edge–Cloud architecture and a surface defect detection algorithm. Considering dynamic characteristics and real-time response requirement, Edge–Cloud architecture is built to achieve smart manufacturing by efficiently collecting, processing, analyzing, and storing data produced by factory. A deep learning–based algorithm is then constructed to detect surface defeats based on multi-modal data, i.e., imaging and depth data. Experiments show the proposed algorithm could achieve high accuracy and recall in small defeat detection task, thus constructing DT in cyber-manufacturing.},

To overcome these issues, the paper proposes the use of Digital Twin technology, which offers a precise, accurate, and controllable lab-based representation of real-world test conditions.

abstract = {The adoption of Digital Twin technology has witnessed significant growth in various domains, enabling continuous monitoring and testing in diverse applications. In the context of safeguarding critical infrastructures, particularly smart grids, Digital Twin has emerged as a viable solution to meet the requirements outlined in the NIS2 directive issued by the European Commission. Additionally, the increasing trend in Europe towards establishing shared dataspaces, and fostering collaborative environments through data sharing, necessitates a heightened focus on cybersecurity risks. This study focuses on enhancing cybersecurity measures in critical infrastructure, with a specific emphasis on the energy sector and smart grids. To achieve this objective, a robust architecture is proposed for the cybersecurity monitoring of a smart power and distribution grid. The proposed approach involves the transformation of a system model, conforming to the Common Information Model standard for the power system domain, into a digital twin model powered by FIWARE, an open-source platform. The architecture incorporates a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution built on open-source technologies. A comprehensive validation is conducted through a real-world case study, providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The developed model of the digital twin of plants must meet the following requirements: real-time environmental data acquisition, user feedback collection, continuous adaptation of the plant development plan for each event, individual instance for field or field part. The digital twin of plant is designed as an intelligent cyber-physical system that has a user-defined knowledge bas and a multi-agent system for planning and modeling of plant growth and development, as well as for forecasting crop parameters. For this purpose, a new method for estimate stage duration and yield is proposed, which defines a "tube" – a corridor to each of the factors corresponding plant development. The key factors have been determined during consultations with practicing agronomists but can be adjusted by users experience. This concept was originally introduced for wheat digital twin, but now is scaled and modified to simulate broccoli growth process.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems underpin many of our society’s critical infrastructures. Ensuring their cyber security is important and complex. A major activity in this regard is cyber security incident response, whose primary goal is to detect and mitigate cyber-attacks in order to ensure the continuity and resilience of services. For cyber-physical systems this is particularly challenging because it requires insights both from the cyber and physical (process) domains and the engagement of stakeholders that are not strictly concerned with cyber security. A technology that is receiving a lot of attention are digital twins – virtual representations of real-world (cyber-physical) systems. They can be used to support tasks such as estimating the state of a system and exploring the consequences of interventional activities (e.g., upgrades). In this paper, we examine the use of digital twins to support cyber security. Specifically, our novel contribution is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the types of activities and how different modalities of digital twin use can be applied to the phases of cyber security incident response. Building on this analysis, we propose a structured approach to enhancing cyber security playbooks for cyber-physical systems incident response with digital twins. Playbooks are an essential component of incident response, ensuring that multi-disciplinary teams are effective in responding to cyber security incidents; therefore, improvements in their execution can result in increased resilience. To illustrate our approach, we present its use for a playbook that is concerned with mitigating a cyber-attack to critical industrial equipment.},

abstract = {In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others. The IoT facilitates the integration and interconnection of devices, enabling them to communicate, share data, and work together to create intelligent and efficient systems. With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift.Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. In the context of V-IoT, which involves autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicles communicating with various sensors and devices, FL is used to develop an anomaly detection model. Current technology, the Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. This enables the system to facilitate efficient and inclusive decision-making. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. Consequently, its advantages may be limited when confronted with urgent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.},

In this position paper, we elucidate unique characteristics and capabilities of a DT framework that enables realization of such promises as online learning of a physical environment, real-time monitoring of assets, Monte Carlo heuristic search for predictive prevention, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning in real-time. We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.},

abstract = {This paper lays out a framework for using modeling and simulation to build a "soft digital twin" (SDT) and demonstrates its efficacy by modeling the maintenance task processes within a real-world mission-critical facility. Such crucial infrastructure systems, such as nuclear power plants, rely on the efficient completion of maintenance tasks (MTs) to achieve high reliability with minimal downtime. Managers often wish for a "crystal ball" that can enable them to configure their resources optimally. However, the MTs are inevitably encountered by various uncertainties rooted in intrinsic equipment failures, endogenous factors (e.g., staffing), and exogenous factors (e.g., supply chain disruptions). Thus, it is challenging to manage these tasks. The proposed SDT can serve as a "crystal ball" to gain insights into resource configurations, staff planning, and task scheduling, thanks to the versatility of simulation. This feasibility study uses both a data-driven framework and stochastic modeling methods to construct the SDT. Initial results indicate the SDT can produce reliable results comparable to the test dataset retrospectively, and it can be used to minimize the time in system of the MTs, while maximizing the throughput within a specific time frame.},

abstract = {The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has made it challenging for large scale data collection, in particular for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based computer vision systems. Additionally, there are numerous circumstances where security, privacy, and limitations pertaining to the accessibility of the required equipment make it arduous to validate computer vision systems with real-world datasets. In this paper, we investigated the possibilities of using synthetic datasets, generated from Virtual Environments (VE) for training and validation of CNN models. We present two use cases where the above-mentioned circumstances play a vital role in preparing the datasets and validating the model with large-scale datasets. By developing and leveraging a three-dimensional Digital Twin (DT), we produce large scale datasets for validating social distancing in workspaces; and in the context of semi-autonomous vehicles, we evaluate how a CNN-based object detection model would perform in an Indian road scenario.},

abstract = {The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical labs, hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT) for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version. EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score are all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL. Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in EvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.},

abstract = {Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.},

In this paper we present our “opportunistic” interpretation, which advances the traditional DT concept and provides a valid support for enabling next-generation solutions in dynamic, distributed and large scale scenarios as smart cities. Indeed, by collecting simple data from the environment and by opportunistically elaborating them through AI techniques directly at the network edge (also referred to as Edge Intelligence), a digital version of a physical object can be built from the bottom up as well as dynamically manipulated and operated in a data-driven manner, thus enabling prompt responses to external stimuli and effective command actuation. To demonstrate the viability of our Opportunistic Digital Twin (ODT) a real use case focused on a traffic prediction task has been incrementally developed and presented, showing improved inference performance and reduced network latency, bandwidth and power consumption.},

abstract = {Microservices are terraforming the computing landscape with web-scale infrastructures (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon) and telecom infrastructures (e.g., ATT, Ericsson) adopting them. At it’s core, the microservices paradigm promotes a decoupling of applications into multiple services – a decoupling that promotes better scalability, fault-tolerance, and deployability. Unfortunately, this decoupling significantly increases the space of configuration options and performance problems, rendering traditional approaches to management ineffective. Recent efforts to address this problem embrace Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). However, training effective AI models requires significant amounts of data and, in some instances, a framework for quickly exploring or analyzing model performance. Digital twins, or simulators, have effectively enabled AI-based management frameworks within other domains (e.g., manufacturing, industrial and automotive). In this paper, we propose the design of KubeKlone, the first comprehensive and opensource digital twin for modeling cloud-native microservices applications. KubeKlone is motivated by our need for accurate, efficient, and general model training. KubeKlone satisfies these goals by decoupling the simulation of microservices from the training of machine learning (ML) models while simultaneously ensuring efficiency and simplifying model design. In particular, KubeKlone introduces a queue-based simulator that abstracts infrastructure details and focuses on modeling, with queues, resource contentions across host and network components. To simplify model design, KubeKlone provides interfaces that hide simulator details and provides wrappers around popular ML packages. To illustrate the strengths of KubeKlone, we validate it against a deployment on Google Cloud Engine and implement several AIOps resource management algorithms (including PARTIES).},

abstract = {With its advantages of low latency and global coverage, the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations can form an effective complement to the terrestrial 5G/6G mobile communication system and provide infrastructure support for broadband access and various services of the Internet. However, due to the spatial particularity of this network across land, sea, air, and other levels, it faces the dilemma of being "easy to attack" and "difficult to defend". At the same time, with the acceleration of the wave of digital transformation, the space Internet is increasingly facing software supply chain security risks. Currently, there is no security simulation and verification platform for the whole life cycle of the space Internet. Therefore, in the present study, we design a digital twin-based hyper large scientific infrastructure for the space Internet named Space Spider to realize the ground simulation of all elements of the space Internet and establish an attack and defense environment for the space Internet to support core technology verification. In addition, we also proposed Spiderland, an open experimental platform for space Internet applications and security researchers, to conduct simulation and attack-defense experiments.},

abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) are an essential concept for Industry 4.0. In recent years, DT architectures and frameworks for industry have been the focus of several research initiatives regarding analytics, predictive maintenance, virtual evaluation &amp; verification, and fault detection &amp; diagnosis. However, the resource constraint and battery-driven devices in an ICPS environment are facing challenges such as short life spans due to high energy consumption, lower availability of the services, and low security capabilities. To meet these challenges, this paper identifies some critical properties for DTs, including energy efficiency, high availability &amp; state persistence, remote &amp; contention control, and security. To provide services in ICPSs, we define the concept of a DT as a proxy (DTaaP) and a four-layer architectural model for the DTaaP that enables meeting the identified properties. We present a generic proof of concept (PoC) implementation by using Eclipse Ditto, which is an open-source digital twin framework. We evaluate our artifact against the listed properties through an experimental scenario. We show that the DTaaP improves energy efficiency, that the DT can serve as an anchor point for security, and that the DTaaP provides availability and persistence for duty cycling devices. We also identify some limitations of Eclipse Ditto for PoC DTaaP implementation, which can be a focus for future research.},

abstract = {Background: Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPSS) denote a service-oriented way of providing access to cyber-physical systems' (CPS) capabilities. The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences and downtime.},

abstract = {Human Digital Twin (HDT) is a powerful tool to create a virtual replica of a human, to be used for example for designing interactions with physical systems, preventing cognitive overload, managing human capital, and maintaining a healthy and motivated workforce. Building human twins is a challenging task due to the need to reliably represent each corresponding human being, and the fact that human beings notably differ from each other. Therefore, relying solely on expert knowledge is insufficient, and human twins must learn the specifics of each individual in order to accurately represent them. This paper focuses on AI methods for modelling the mental wellbeing of knowledge workers because the mounting cognitive demands of both white-collar and blue-collar work lead to employees’ stress, and stress leads to diminished creativity and motivation, increased sick leaves, and in severe cases, accidents, burnouts, and disabilities. This paper describes the main building blocks of AI-based detectors of mental stress and highlights the main challenges and future directions of research., which are expected to be relevant also for HDT learning in other domains because the high degree of individuality is ubiquitous in all human activities.},

Human Digital Twins, i.e., digital representations of the patient, could help address this challenge by monitoring the patient’s condition via sensors and communicating it to the caregivers through corresponding user interfaces. However, existing user interfaces in stroke rehabilitation primarily focus on the interaction between patients or therapists. This paper proposes a novel dashboard designed explicitly for informal caregivers in upper-limb stroke rehabilitation. The dashboard supports easy-to-understand communication of complex patient data and provides tools to involve informal caregivers in the patient’s therapy process. Feedback from semi-structured interviews with informal caregivers validates the critical need for corresponding user interfaces but also raises questions concerning the design of visualization and data privacy.},

abstract = {With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.},

They aid in deriving insights to control entities and processes in the digital world and use those insights to drive actions in the physical world. Simulation is one of the key enabling technologies that lie at the heart of digital twin development, as it provides enhanced visibility into future performance and the ability to identify profit-optimal decisions. This tutorial describes how we envision the digital twins developed in industry and the pivotal role simulation plays in their development. Using supply chain digital twins as an example application, we introduce our digital twin framework that simulation practitioners might find useful when developing their digital twin solutions to understand what did happen, predict what may happen, and determine solutions to fix future problems before they happen. We conclude with simulation research streams that contribute to the use of simulation in digital twin development.},

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {As the need for situational awareness rises in search and rescue tasks, systems for human spatial sensing augmentation in complex-built environments has become increasingly important. Sensor-based mapping and augmented reality (AR) techniques have been tested to provide enhanced visual assistance in indoor scenarios, such as "seeing through walls" abilities for occluded areas. Scholars have examined various scanning techniques and UI/UX designs for AR-based occlusion visualization. However, evidence is still needed to show how scene capturing, 3D mapping, rendering and visualization can be executed integratively, enabling an instantaneous "Digital Twins" modeling. This paper presents a robot-based system for mapping indoor environments and creating a near real-time virtual replica. A dynamically updated 3D map rendered with Unity generates egocentric "x-ray vision" views of the occluded objects using AR headsets. A case study was performed in a lab room, resulting in virtual regeneration of surroundings supporting search and rescue in occluded areas.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is currently transforming the industrial landscape through the use of innovative technologies and novel data management approaches. The incorporation of Industry 4.0 brought new dimensions of improvement and autonomy into the existing industrial manufacturing processes which has also led to increased expectations for traceability in manufacturing. Traceability enables the tracking of every part and product of the manufacturing process giving insights into each manufactured component and its full history across each operation step that helps manufacturers improve quality and efficiency. Despite the huge potential in facilitating the optimization of the production lines, product traceability has remained a challenging topic in mass manufacturing. Hence, in this paper, an innovative Blockchain-based framework is proposed to integrate the processes of a real production line using the Industry 4.0 Festo Cyber-Physical Factory located at London Digital Twin Research Centre, Middlesex University. Blockchain technology is a distributed and shared database of events for a product life cycle that is encrypted in blocks or smaller data units. This paper introduces a viable blockchain-based framework implemented within a real smart product assembly for internal traceability within the production process in order to improve the security by preventing counterfeiting, identify specific problems on the production line and provide objective proof for product quality assurance.},

abstract = {Ever since cyber attacks focused on industrial and critical infrastructure settings, the awareness of the security issues of these systems has increased. These industrial control systems (ICS) mainly focus on operation and availability -- instead of providing general security features. Moreover, the current Industry 4.0 movement aggravates this security gap by connecting the ICS to the enterprise network, which facilitates targeting these systems. Proper system testing can reveal the system's vulnerabilities and provide remedies. However, security measures are usually neglected or addressed after an emerging incident only, which results in high costs. To maximize the benefit of system testing, we argue that it should be carried out as early as possible, especially to render systems secure-by-design. In this work, we propose an approach for introducing security-by-design system testing by the application of a digital twin. A digital twin is able to represent a system virtually along its lifecycle. To enable security-by-design, the simulation capability of digital twin is harnessed to create a prospective environment of a planned system. This allows detecting vulnerabilities before they can emerge in the real-world and providing a adequate risk strategy. Our work shows how security-by-design system testing is anchored in the security applications along a system's lifecycle. Next to proposing a security-by-design system testing approach with digital twins, we implement a digital twin representing a pressure vessel, and demonstrate how to carry out each step of our proposed approach. During this proof-of-concept, we identify vulnerabilities and show how an attacker can compromise the system by manipulating values of the pressure vessel with the potential to cause over-pressure, which, in turn, can result in an explosion of the vessel.},

The analysis shows that there is a misconception regarding the digital twin concept that may be leading to its misuse. Moreover, it was found that security is not a top priority, but is often mentioned as a challenge. Besides the lack of standardization, the amount of academic papers published and industrial solutions offered is increasing, showing that the consensus is not a limiting factor and the concept is gaining popularity over the years and being applied in an increasing number of sectors, mainly on manufacturing, energy, aerospace and automotive.},

The lower computer utilize an improved memory management strategy to execute the algorithm with as little memory space as possible without affecting the inference speed.

abstract = {Coastal lagoons are ecosystems with significant environmental and socio-economic value. However, these natural systems are especially vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanization as a consequence of the tourist development. Despite the vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems, there has been limited development of novel techniques which can provide real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources. Beyond being useful for policy-making procedures at multiple levels of granularity, such tools can increase local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts. This paper introduces the key concept behind the SMARTLAGOON project, which intends to develop a digital twin to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Particularly, we focus on the main research activities carried out since the beginning of the project (January 1st, 2021), which are mainly based on initial mapping and reporting of the main stakeholders' needs and wishes in relation to the technological products to be developed in SMARTLAGOON. This will onset the initial development pathway, while additional stakeholder inputs during the project lifetime will help to further explore and prioritize the key developments, thus maximizing the relevance and impact of the Mar Menor's digital twin.},

abstract = {The advent of communication technologies and smart storage gave rise to the concept of smart cities. One of the key enabling technologies of smart living is the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has developed into many areas of application including critical national infrastructure (CNI) such as transport, hospitals and power distribution grid. The proliferation in IoT applications raised many serious security and privacy concerns to citizens, businesses and governments. CNI systems depend heavily on IoT devices and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) to perform autonomous actions or inform human decision makers through the exchange and processing of data. Recently, blockchain has been advocated as a solution for secure data storage and sharing. Blockchain cryptographically offers a secure platform for maintaining a decentralised, ”append-only”, publicly verifiable and immutable data structure, which is timestamped and sequentially ordered by its reference to previous block hashes. The immutability and security of blockchain can improve the CNI protection. Two specific smart CNI enabling technologies that would highly benefit from blockchain are IoT and CPS. Digital twins are virtual replica&nbsp;of the&nbsp;network and&nbsp;logic layer of&nbsp;physical system. A digital twin provides a platform to solve major IoT related CNI cybersecurity challenges in tomorrow’s secure infrastructure, energy distribution, smart cities, smart manufacturing (Industrial IoT and Industry4.0) and autonomous transit systems. This key note discussion outlines how to implement blockchain as a fundamental theory for trustless security for connected CNI. It will investigate technologies which can be utilised to achieve a trustless matrix such as blockchain and peer-distributed security systems, for instance onion-routing, with the wider aim of defining trustless security further. The research also considers the feasibility of trustless IoT security systems and their application in CNI. It investigate the present state-of-the-art in cybersecurity as it relates to trustless security technologies and blockchain and what is the present state of the art of cybersecurity in IoT-enabled CNI systems.},

abstract = {Digital twins are increasingly developed to support the development, operation, and maintenance of cyber-physical systems such as industrial elevators. However, industrial elevators continuously evolve due to changes in physical installations, introducing new software features, updating existing ones, and making changes due to regulations (e.g., enforcing restricted elevator capacity due to COVID-19), etc. Thus, digital twin functionalities (often built on neural network-based models) need to evolve themselves constantly to be synchronized with the industrial elevators. Such an evolution is preferred to be automated, as manual evolution is time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, collecting sufficient data to re-train neural network models of digital twins could be expensive or even infeasible. To this end, we propose unceRtaInty-aware tranSfer lEarning enriched Digital Twins LATTICE, a transfer learning based approach capable of transferring knowledge about the waiting time prediction capability of a digital twin of an industrial elevator across different scenarios. LATTICE also leverages uncertainty quantification to further improve its effectiveness. To evaluate LATTICE, we conducted experiments with 10 versions of an elevator dispatching software from Orona, Spain, which are deployed in a Software in the Loop (SiL) environment. Experiment results show that LATTICE, on average, improves the Mean Squared Error by 13.131% and the utilization of uncertainty quantification further improves it by 2.71%.},

abstract = {As more and more security tools provide organizations with cybersecurity capabilities, security analysts are overwhelmed by security events. Resolving these events is challenging due to extensive manual processes, limited financial resources, and human errors. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) is an established approach to manage security tools and assets. However, SOAR platforms typically integrate traditional IT systems only. Additional considerations are required to deal with the Internet of Things (IoT), its multiple devices and complex networks. Therefore, we adapt SOAR to IoT. We first aggregate existing research and information on SOAR and SOAR platforms. We envision the SOAR4IoT framework, making IoT assets manageable for SOAR via middleware. We implement a prototypical digital twin-based SOAR application integrating IoT assets and security tools to validate our framework. The experimental setup includes two playbooks coping with Mirai and Sybil attacks. Results show feasibility as our SOAR application enables securing IoT assets with digital twins.},

Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index. The evaluation model of machine tool is solved by Reference Ideal Method (RIM). Finally, the proposed decision-making approach for DMTS is tested in an aviation plant.},

DM is facing new challenges as dependencies between IoT devices generate various threats, such as update breaks and cascading failures. Dependencies-related threats are exacerbated by the fragmentation of the DM market, where multiple actors, e.g., operators and device manufacturers, are uncoordinately ensuring DM on interdependent devices, each using its DM solution. Identifying the topology of threatening dependencies is key in developing dependency-aware DM capabilities for legacy DM solutions to tackle dependencies-related threats efficiently. In this work, we apply Semantic Web and Digital Twin technologies to build a decision-support framework that automatically infers the topology of threatening dependencies in IoT systems. We integrate the proposed framework into the in-use Digital Twin platform Thing in the future and demonstrate its effectiveness by inferring threatening dependencies in smart home scenarios managed by ground-truth DM solutions, such as Orange's implementation of the USP Controller and Samsung's SmartThings Platform.},

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 is defined as connecting the physical system to the cyber world with the help of transformative technologies. As a result, the number of cyber-attacks have grown exponentially. Cybersecurity has been identified as one of main challenges in applying the transformative technologies of Industry 4.0. An industrial system within the context of Industry 4.0 generally, a cyber physical system (CPS), is incredibly complex and involves heterogeneous devices. How to detect the attacks and analyse the vulnerability of the system are actively explored and researched. However, because of the high cost and difficulty to access real industrial CPS, it is difficult for researchers to get opportunities to use real industrial systems in the research. For this reason, a variety of software tools and virtualization methods have been used to create virtual or hybrid systems for researchers. This paper study and review existing cybersecurity research on CPS in the virtual environment. Then authors point out four challenges in the state-of-the-art research based on the findings and discussion. From this, Digital Twin (DT), one of the main enabling technologies in Industry 4.0, has been identified to have the great potential in solving these challenges. DT sheds light on the real fusion of the cyber world and the physical world, and it has the potential to be used as a technology to help people build virtulized system with high-fidelity, hence greatly lower bar on the cybersecurity research of the cyber physical system and create other DT based cybersecurity applications.},

The fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), aims at reducing the effort needed for changes in industrial production lines. The key benefits of next-generation manufacturing systems are less downtimes and the production of small lot sizes down to lot size 1. I4.0 does not introduce a silver bullet technology, but requires a transformation of the system architecture of production systems. In the literature, however, there systematic guidance for designing manufacturing systems that address central I4.0 use cases like plug'n’produce and end-to-end communication is still missing, as are details on the infrastructure needed to enable I4.0 technologies such as Digital Twins. To contribute to filling this gap, this paper presents (i) a Digital Twin architecture blueprint driven by central I4.0 use cases and (ii) a prototypical open-source implementation of the architecture using the concept of the Asset Administration Shell.},

abstract = {IoT Device Management (DM) refers to the remote administration of customer devices. In practice, DM is ensured by multiple actors such as operators or device manufacturers, each operating independently via their DM solution. These siloed DM solutions are limited in addressing IoT threats related to device dependencies, such as cascading failures, as these threats spread across devices managed by different DM actors, and their mitigation can no longer be performed without collaborative DM efforts. The first step toward collaborative mitigation of these threats is the identification of threatening dependency topology. However, this task is challenging, requiring the inference of dependencies from the data held by different actors. In this work, we propose a collaborative framework that infers the threatening topology of dependencies by accessing and aggregating data from legacy DM solutions. It combines the assets of Semantic Web standards and Digital Twin technology to capture on-demand the topology of dependencies, and it is designed to be used in business applications such as customer care to enhance customer Quality of Experience. We integrate our solution within the in-use Orange's Digital Twin platform Thing in the future and demonstrate its effectiveness by automatically inferring threatening dependencies in the two settings: a simulated smart home scenario managed by ground-truth DM solutions, such as Orange's implementation of the USP Controller and Samsung's SmartThings Platform, and a realistic smart home called DOMUS testbed.},

We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.},

Existing solutions focus on physical process, control logic, or network communication simulation. Unfortunately, none of the Digital Twin solutions currently available provide a realistic and holistic solution to represent all three aspects. In this work, we propose the Digital HydrAuLic SIMulator (DHALSIM), a Digital Twin for water distribution systems that simulates physical, control, and network processes. DHALSIM builds on the integration of the Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR) hydraulic simulator and MiniCPS—an industrial network emulator—which are run in a co-simulation environment. Thanks to this integration, DHALSIM is able to simulate the hydraulic processes characterizing a water distribution system as well as full stack emulation of well-known industrial control protocols. The Digital Twin is demonstrated on the benchmark case study of C-Town, where we carry out a number of cyber-attack experiments. To our knowledge, DHALSIM is the first Digital Twin that implements a well known physics simulator with a virtual industrial logic and network emulation environment for water systems. DHALSIM is open source and available to the research community.},

However, constructing and maintaining digital twins is a challenging engineering task - and, to date, there is a lack of understanding of the engineering techniques and methodologies required. To address these challenges, we created EDT.Community, a programme of seminars on the engineering of digital twins hosting digital twins experts from academia and industry. In this paper, we report on the main topics of discussion from the first year of the programme.

abstract = {With increasing interdependencies and evolving threats, maintaining operational continuity in critical systems has become a significant challenge. This paper presents the DYNABIC (Dynamic business continuity of critical infrastructures on top of adaptive multi-level cybersecurity) approach as a comprehensive framework to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructures. The DYNABIC approach provides the resilience enhancement through dynamic adaptation, automated response, collaboration, risk assessment, and continuous improvement. By fostering a proactive and collaborative approach to resilience, the DYNABIC framework empowers critical infrastructure sectors to effectively mitigate disruptions and recover from incidents. The paper explores the key components and architecture of the DYNABIC approach and highlights its potential to strengthen the resilience of critical infrastructures using the concept of Digital Twins in the face of evolving threats and complex operating environments involving cascading effects.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 aims at evolving the current industrial processes towards directly connecting shopfloor machines to systems from different layers of the automation pyramid, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). There are key functional and quality requirements that apply to most Industry 4.0 systems independent of the application domain, e.g., requirements related to interoperability, recoverability, security, and modifiability. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of understanding of (i) architecture drivers that focus on these quality aspects and (ii) architecture solutions for these architecture drivers that are adequate for a wide range of Industry 4.0 contexts. To contribute to filling this gap, we present in this paper (i) quality-centered architecture drivers derived from industrial cases, and (ii) architecture solutions based on the concepts of Digital Twins, Service-Oriented Architecture, and Virtual Automation Bus for four recurrent production plant scenarios. The architecture drivers and solutions presented in this paper were instantiated in different Industry 4.0 contexts, such as BaSys 4.0 (the German national reference project for Industry 4.0), and by the BaSys industry project partners.},

abstract = {Continuous and effective monitoring of chronic diseases and their associated treatments might have a decisive impact on reducing risks and improving life quality of patients. This, however, demands new and innovative methods for engineering systems that support the required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to revolutionize traditional medical practices. A DT comprises a set of virtual representations of both the structural elements and dynamics of any physical asset (e.g., a patient) throughout its lifecycle. In the healthcare domain, it might represent a significan step forward towards tightening and improving the interactions between systems, caregivers and patients. Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.},

abstract = {Despite the recent increase in the popularity of blockchain, the technology suffers from the trilemma trade-off between security decentralisation and scalability prohibiting adoption, and limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of the induced system. Addressing the trilemma trade-off calls for dynamic management and configuration of the blockchain system. In particular, choosing an effective and efficient consensus protocol for balancing the trilemma trade-off when inducing the blockchain-based system is acknowledged to be a challenging problem given the dynamic and complex nature of the blockchain environment. DDDAS approaches are particularly suitable for this challenge, and in previous work, the authors presented a novel DDDAS-based blockchain architecture and demonstrated that it offers a promising approach for dynamically adjusting the parameters of a system and optimising for the trade-off. This paper presents a novel simulation tool that can support and satisfy the DDDAS requirements for a dynamically re-configurable blockchain system. The tool supports the simulation and the dynamic switching of consensus protocols, analysing their trilemma trade-off. The simulator design is modular and allows the implementation and analysis of a wide range of consensus protocols and their implementation scenarios, along with the ability for parallelization. The paper also presents a quantitative evaluation of the tool.},

abstract = {Digital twins play a key role in realizing the vision of a smart factory. While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.},

A large spectrum of the well-known tools for software configuration management is available. However, most of them do not solve problems emerging in the considered subject domain fully. To this end, we propose a new framework for implementing preparing, debugging, delivering, testing, deploying, and configuring virtualized software of digital twins. Currently, we are developing such twins for analyzing the operation of environmentally friendly equipment of infrastructural objects located in the Baikal natural territory. The proposed framework is based on the integrated applying methods and tools of knowledge engineering, multi-agent technologies, conceptual and service-oriented programming, and administration of hybrid distributed computing systems. These systems can include both personal resources and resources of public access centers, grid systems, and cloud or fog platforms. We carried out the practical experiments with the framework prototype. The obtained results have shown that significant speedup in performing the aforementioned processes can be achieved.},

There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs’ potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature.

The focus of the research would be a change in the procedures to follow nature and draw attention and inspiration from the ancient architecture of the Hawamahal (a palace in the city of Jaipur, India). This article examines Hawamahal’s ancient architecture regarding temperature and passive cooling insulation. It makes recommendations for combining traditional ideas with a method of integrated, immersive technology to demonstrate environmental challenges and preserve the ethnic heritage digitally. The simulation results represent the temperature difference between Hawamahal’s inner and outer spaces during summer days. The study’s findings include using a digital twin system to discover the immersive experience of Jaipur’s Hawamahal without requiring physical participation. For the culture and tourism industries, this has the potential to be a digital revolution. The findings also show the wealth of ancient Indian architecture compared to modern twenty-first-century infrastructure and provide a virtual reality experience of Hawamahal.},

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.},

abstract = {Digital twin technology has revolutionized the state-of-the-art practice in many industries, and digital twins have a natural application to modeling cancer patients. By simulating patients at a more fundamental level than conventional machine learning models, digital twins can provide unique insights by predicting each patient's outcome trajectory. This has numerous associated benefits, including patient-specific clinical decision-making support and the potential for large-scale virtual clinical trials. Historically, it has not been feasible to use digital twin technology to model cancer patients because of the large number of variables that impact each patient's outcome trajectory, including genotypic, phenotypic, social, and environmental factors. However, the path to digital twins in radiation oncology is becoming possible due to recent progress, such as multiscale modeling techniques that estimate patient-specific cellular, molecular, and histological distributions, and modern cryptographic techniques that enable secure and efficient centralization of patient data across multiple institutions. With these and other future scientific advances, digital twins for radiation oncology will likely become feasible. This work discusses the likely generalized architecture of patient-specific digital twins and digital twin networks, as well as the benefits, existing barriers, and potential gateways to the application of digital twin technology in radiation oncology.},

abstract = {A cyber–cyber digital twin is a simulation of a software system. By contrast, a cyber–physical digital twin is a simulation of a non-software (physical) system. Although cyber–physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber–cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber–cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber–cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber–cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber–cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical ramifications for the design, implementation and deployment of digital twins at Facebook.},

abstract = {Digitalizing real-world assets has numerous benefits, including the algorithmic analysis of physical objects. Digital twin (DT) technology has evolved to further contribute with continuous real-time data valuable flow to the analysis. With this analysis comes a greater understanding of a problem, which, in turn, provides a more comprehensive solution. We will examine the definition of critical infrastructure, to understand better how DT technology can be applied in a large-scale physical environment. We then turn our focus to the components within the energy sector of critical infrastructure, including various Industrial Control Systems (ICS) components with a focus on sensor networks and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. With this understanding, we examine research pertinent to the key features of a DT and how that may be applied to the sensor and ICS networks. Field sensors within ICS are susceptible to semantic attacks leading to disruption of horizontal and lateral operations and systems. With this possibility, incident response algorithms can be implemented in a digital space of an energy grid to maintain security and operability during adverse conditions. This review intends to outline these core components for additional lab testing and research, analyzing the effectiveness of digital twins in securing operations of Industrial Control Systems in the energy sector.},

abstract = {Blockchain systems are challenged by the so-called Trilemma tradeoff: decentralization, scalability, and security. Infrastructure and node configuration, choice of the Consensus Protocol, and complexity of the application transactions are cited among the factors that affect the tradeoff balance. Given that Blockchains are complex, dynamic systems, a dynamic approach to their management and reconfiguration at runtime is deemed necessary to reflect the changes in the state of the infrastructure and application. This paper introduces the utilization of DigitalTwins for this purpose. The novel contribution of the paper is the design of a framework and conceptual architecture of a Digital Twin that can assist in maintaining the Trilemma tradeoffs of time-critical systems. The proposed Digital Twin is illustrated via an innovative approach to the dynamic selection of Consensus Protocols. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can effectively support the dynamic adaptation and management of the Blockchain.},

abstract = {An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.},

abstract = {This paper presents concepts and approaches towards a climate and energy oriented digital twin for public buildings. The sustainable, resource-efficient operation of these buildings, such as schools and education centers, and the monitoring, control, and optimization of their climate, air, and energy performance pose multiple challenges, in particular to cope with the consequences of climate change and changes in the energy economy. In our approach, we consider buildings in which a network of heterogeneous sensors in each spatial unit records key properties such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, as well as energy consumption and solar energy production. The continuously collected sensor data forms a spatio-temporal data space, which is used by the digital twin as a basis for AI-based analyses and simulations. The transfer of time-series data in near real time can be done by different databases. Analysis techniques focusing on time-series data allow for targeted access to the information and support the identification of exceptional events, recurring patterns, and the comparison of energy and climate-related performance. A prototype of an energy- and climate-oriented digital twin is currently being implemented in a government project in Andalusia, Spain, covering about 430 public buildings.},

abstract = {App-based ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, have become popular thanks to technology advancements including smartphones and 4G/5G network. However, little is known about to what degree their operations impact urban traffic since Transportation Network Companies seldom share their ride data due to business and user privacy reasons. Recently, transportation engineering researchers began to collect data in large cities trying to understand the transportation impacts of ride-hailing services, so as to assist transport planning and policy making. However, (1) there does not exist a general data collection approach applicable to any city, and (2) the studies were based on historical data and cannot project the future easily even though ride-hailing services are developing quickly.In this paper, we introduce our approach to building a digital twin of the transportation in the medium-sized city of Birmingham, Alabama. This digital twin is a transportation simulation model that incorporates transportation modes such as public transits and ride-hailing services, in addition to private vehicles that constitute the majority of Birmingham's traffic. With this digital twin, transportation engineers can flexibly analyze the impact of ride-hailing services under different scenarios, such as "if the number of Uber drivers doubles" which could happen in the near future. The digital twin may also enable new opportunities, such as being an environment for learning policies with reinforcement learning.To enable realistic transportation simulation, we propose a novel approach to collect Uber ride data that is easy to carry out in any city. This approach collects app screenshots about Uber rides from Uber drivers, and uses crowdsourcing to postprocess these screenshots to extract detailed ride information. We then fit a spatiotemporal distribution of Uber rides using the collected data via network kernel density estimation (KDE). The existing network KDE method is flawed in that the contributions of different data samples are not the same, so we propose a new formulation to solve this issue. The distribution combined with population statistics from census data enable the generation of realistic Uber rides for agent-based simulation.

abstract = {In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior.In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.},

Our model can be instantiated in various scenarios and we have in particular considered the popular case of food traceability. In contrast to other models known in the literature that propose their own ad-hoc properties to assess the robustness of their supply chain management systems, in this work, we use the formalism of secure computation, where processes are described through generic and natural ideal functionalities.},

A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a "digital twin" of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.},

abstract = {Combined safety and cybersecurity testing are critical for assessing the reliability and optimisation of autonomous driving (AD) algorithms. However, safety and cybersecurity testing is often conducted in isolation, leading to a lack of evaluation of the complex system-of-system interactions which impact the reliability and optimisation of the AD algorithm. Concurrently, practical limitations of testing include resource usage and time. This paper proposes a methodology for combined safety and cybersecurity testing and applies it to a real-world AV shuttle using digital twin, software-in-the-loop (SiL) simulation and a real-world Autonomous Vehicle (AV) test environment. The results of the safety and cybersecurity tests and feedback from the AD algorithm designers demonstrate that the methodology developed is useful for assessing the reliability and optimisation of an AD algorithm in the development phase. Furthermore, from the observed system-of-system interactions, key relationships such as speed and attack parameters can be used to optimise testing.},

abstract = {The introduction of the Digital Twin (DT) has sparked a great deal of interest in the virtual replication of physical assets and processes. However, to fully realize the potential of DT, companies require robust and scalable front-end solutions. This study proposes harnessing micro-frontend technologies to surmount the limitations of monolithic front-end frameworks, thereby crafting effective presentation layers tailored for industrial companies. By decomposing complex and distributed systems into modular web-based DT, the proposed framework enables better scalability, synergy, and efficient application development. It also tackles the intricacies introduced by complex multi-vendor elements within DT and the orchestration of services and virtual environments. Research is focused on developing an architecture that facilitates seamless connectivity between multiple blocks of DT as well as interactivity and immersive experiences. Our study offers insights into our journey of implementing this framework for various industrial use cases, such as training, monitoring, and control, highlighting the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges. Ultimately, this research aims to accelerate the creation of DT, improve maintainability, and increase efficiency and productivity in industrial environments.},

abstract = {Many enterprises outsource network management (e.g., troubleshooting failures, monitoring performance) to third-party managed service providers (MSPs) to reduce cost. Unfortunately, recent incidents show that MSPs themselves have become an attractive launchpad to gain access to customer networks. In this work, we argue that such incidents arise due to a violation of the least privilege principle. We revisit the MSP outsourcing problem through this least-privilege view, identify key challenges in realizing this framework, and present initial ideas toward this goal. In particular, we propose providing the MSP provider an isolated "digital twin" environment to resolve problems and prevent providers from directly accessing the customer production network. Changes are verified before importing them into the production network, ensuring there are no privilege violations. Our preliminary experiments show that our approach can resolve practical problems (e.g., misconfigurations) and is effective in reducing the attack surfaces for MSP customers.},

Smart cities are becoming eco-friendly, livable, and sustainable to deliver essential services to their citizens by leveraging internet and communication technology advancements. Starting from a short literature review about smart cities and smart services, a recent trend in the technology used to implement smart services is collected. Smart service can be defined as a service conveyed using intelligent products that possess awareness and connectivity. All kinds of smart services can be connected in smart cities to offer citizens comprehensive solutions. Pre-emptive services, self-services, or highly interactive services, for example, have the potential to be implemented using current technology such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, machine-to-machine communications, and the digital twin. Therefore, there is scope for research and implementation of other technology for smart services in the future.},

abstract = {Bluetooth Mesh technology can be used to realize heterogeneous IoT networks, consisting of a smart lighting backbone augmented with sensor-based applications. It offers many configuration options to adhere to the diverse application requirements and limit the overhead. Finding an optimal configuration of the network is a complex issue which leads to numerous performance-related questions. In this paper, Digital Twin technology is used to provide continuous and diverse insights into the network's behavior, under monitored or artificial network conditions. The twin is constantly connected to the physical network and combines selective simulation, graph algorithms and a data driven link model into a single toolbox. We evaluated its usage for smart lighting applications on a real-life testbed. The results indicate that the twin can produce end-to-end (E2E) latencies, E2E path distributions and a packet delivery ratio comparable to experiment outcomes in the physical network and in compliance with application requirements. Statistical validation of the similarity between measured and predicted E2E latency distributions indicates a Mean Absolute Error &lt; 10 % and a positive discrete Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for all results.},

This paper proposes a conceptual model for mitigating forest fire risk by use of self-adaptive and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Memoryless property of exponential distribution is also reflected and considered in the calculations of forest fire probabilities. Stochastic and dynamic properties of the situation and the mathematical complexity of the routing problem entailed and justified a simulation study. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach for routing UAVs and the validity of the proposed model are tested on a small sized realistic scenario. Experimental results encourage the development of complex models. Integrating the proposed model with advanced information technologies may lead to the development of a digital twin system.},

Furthermore, a wide range of hardware and software configurations for different IoT solutions easily become hard to analyze and maintain.In this paper, we present our industry solution called IoT Solution Optimizer (IoT-Opt) that helps to efficiently model and validate the performance of any proposed or deployed IoT products within a few minutes. The core idea is the digital twin technology that allows users to quickly assess implementation choices of IoT devices and model the effect of various deployment characteristics such as mobility, on their design and choose to optimize the communication efficiency or battery life performance. This innovative and powerful performance modeling capability helps enterprises accelerate their time-to-market, avoid unnecessary prolonged field trials and thereby reduce project costs. Simply put, IoT-Opt is the industry's most powerful middleware that is used by various IoT commercial products to deploy their solution.},

abstract = {With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals.Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that.In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.},

abstract = {In Cloud Computing, the cloud serves as a central data hub for the Industrial Internet of Things' (IIoT) data and is deployed in diverse application fields, e.g., Smart Grid or Smart Manufacturing. Therefore, the aggregated and contextualized data is bundled in a central data hub, bringing tremendous cybersecurity advantages. Given the threat landscape in IIoT systems, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to be prepared regarding their cybersecurity, react quickly, and strengthen their overall cybersecurity. For instance, with the application of machine learning algorithms, security-related data can be analyzed predictively in order to be able to ward off a potential attack at an early stage. Since modern reference architectures for IIoT systems, such as RAMI 4.0 or IIRA, consider cybersecurity approaches on a high level and SMEs lack financial funds and knowledge, this paper conceptualizes a security analytics service used as a security add-on to these reference architectures. Thus, this paper conceptualizes a flexible security analytics service that implements security capabilities with flexible analytical techniques that fit specific SMEs' needs. The security analytics service is also evaluated with a real-world use case.},

These applications have placed a huge strain on today's wireless network. mmWave technology is promising to solve this problem by providing a large bandwidth over the very-high-frequency spectrum band. However, most mmWave radios and platforms have much higher power consumption than what IoT devices and their applications can afford. Hence, mmWave networks cannot be utilized in most IoT applications today. In this work, we present a novel low-power mmWave platform, which brings this technology to IoT applications. Our approach to design this platform is to take a holistic view and optimize the whole wireless system by considering practical challenges in mmWave communication. Our lowcost and low-power platform not only brings mmWave communication to IoT applications, but also enables researchers that do not have hardware background to work on mmWave research.},

abstract = {Increasingly Industrial Control Systems (ICS) systems are being connected to the Internet to minimise the operational costs and provide additional flexibility. These control systems such as the ones used in power grids, manufacturing and utilities operate continually and have long lifespans measured in decades rather than years as in the case of IT systems. Such industrial control systems require uninterrupted and safe operation. However, they can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, as successful attacks on critical control infrastructures could have devastating consequences to the safety of human lives as well as a nation’s security and prosperity. Furthermore, there can be a range of attacks that can target ICS and it is not easy to secure these systems against all known attacks let alone unknown ones. In this paper, we propose a software enabled security architecture using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) that can enhance the capability to secure industrial control systems. We have designed such an SDN/NFV enabled security architecture and developed a Control System Security Application (CSSA) in SDN Controller for enhancing security in ICS by achieving real time situational awareness and dynamic policy-driven decision making across the network infrastructure. In particular, CSSA can be used for establishing secure path for end-to-end communication between devices and also deal against certain specific attacks namely denial of service attacks, from unpatched vulnerable control system components and securing the communication flows from the legacy devices that do not support any security functionality. We also discuss how CSSA provides reliable paths for safety critical messages in control systems. We discuss the prototype implementation of the proposed architecture and the results obtained from our analysis.},

abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

The authors propose indicators of innovative activity in the field of smart manufacturing in the regions. The concept of a chain of the region's own means of production has been introduced. It is a set of 10 types of patents in the field of smart manufacturing registered in the region. They include the following patents: advanced manufacturing technologies, robotics, advanced materials, artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of things, mobility, photonics, security, digital twins. The most recent of these are digital twin technologies. Using the cluster method, the authors have grouped 43 regions according to the level of innovation in the field of smart manufacturing, based on data from WIPO and the European Commission for 2018. All this allowed the authors to develop a classification consisting of 11 strategies of innovation activity of regions in the field of smart manufacturing. On the basis of the scoring method, the authors have been asked to define the class of each region by the level of innovation in the field of smart manufacturing. For example, the United States received a high level of innovation in smart manufacturing (1st class). The remaining 42 regions were ranked as 2nd to 9th class of innovation activity in smart manufacturing. The potential for increased innovation has been identified in South Korea and Canada. This classification of strategies allows to study the experience of other regions in the field of smart manufacturing and to assess the investment risks of projects for smart factories.},

abstract = {Sustainable HCI was initially structured along two axes: sustainability in design, i.e. reducing the material impact of software and hardware, and sustainability through design, i.e. influencing user behavior to reduce energy consumption. These approaches have been criticized for being reductive and insufficient in the face of the systemic problem of ecological transition. Some voices in the HCI community call for a broader consideration of non-human aspects in HCI and argue that new methods and tools should be developed for this purpose. The thesis aims at proposing a methodology to understand the interactions between the system to be designed (e.g. agricultural robot) and the dynamics of the socio-technical and social system (e.g. the agriculture and food sectors), in order to avoid simplistic solutions that could be counter-productive (e.g. rebound effect). It draws on the methods, tools, and techniques of systemic design (a recent field of research that brings together design and systems thinking) in order to build, with the stakeholders and the help of experts, a model of the socio-technical system, its dynamics, and its possible interactions with the system to be designed. The aim is not to build a "digital twin" of the socio-technical system from which one could predict its evolution, but rather to co-build a handmade and approximate model to support debate, to inform decisions, and to compare scenarios. To this end, the thesis proposes a "quali-quantitative" modeling tool based on the formalism of causal loop diagrams.},

abstract = {We present an approach for classifying 3D point clouds of indoor environments using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image analysis for entropy-selected 3D views. Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects. We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.},

abstract = {Today's software and hardware technologies enable the expansion of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) into the realms of mobility (car2x, autonomous driving), energy (power plants, smart grid) and healthcare (health monitoring), paving the way into a highly interlaced world. However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4]. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method. The envisioned method is supposed to be a holistic approach that supports the efficient cross-domain design, development, implementation and maintenance of dependable CPSs, where security and safety are a critical aspect that requires an in-depth risk assessment.},

abstract = {Hospitals are considered as highly complex critical infrastructure buildings due to their size and significant usage. Therefore, a high level of communication and coordination of all stakeholders and tasks is required for successful hospital management, starting with the planning of the building and especially for the utilization phase. This paper presents the opportunities and challenges of the digital method Building Information Modelling (BIM) in hospital construction for the building management to improve the health care service management. The relevant background information regarding BIM in general, hospital projects in which BIM has been applied, etc. was obtained by literature research.Based on background information obtained by literature research about BIM and the application in hospitals, guided interviews were conducted to determine the opportunities and challenges of BIM in hospital construction. In this process experts from the healthcare sector were interviewed who had already gained experience with the BIM application in single pilot projects. The evaluation of the interviews was carried out with qualitative content analysis according to Mayring.Although BIM is applied as a digital method in construction industry, the benefits go beyond the construction perspective. A BIM model provides the necessary infrastructure to advance the digitalization of hospital services. The digital twin of the building can be considered as basis therefore. Besides the opportunities for the hospital building, there are presented possibilities in the utilization for health care service based on the BIM model, e.g. automated disinfection of door handles in the building. However, there are also challenges for the implementation and application of BIM, as for example the model needs to be constantly maintained by qualified personnel in order to ensure reliability.},

However, the HRI community lacks a set of shared terminology and framework for characterizing aspects of mixed reality interfaces, presenting serious problems for future research. Therefore, it is important to have a common set of terms and concepts that can be used to precisely describe and organize the diverse array of work being done within the field. In this article, we present a novel taxonomic framework for different types of VAM-HRI interfaces, composed of four main categories of virtual design elements (VDEs). We present and justify our taxonomy and explain how its elements have been developed over the past 30 years as well as the current directions VAM-HRI is headed in the coming decade.},

However, this diversity and heterogeneity can limit interoperability. Users on different platforms cannot be authenticated because IoT platforms have different representations and data formats for the same resource and do not understand each other's data models. In addition, users on other platforms cannot grant permissions because they do not understand the policies and required attribute values of other platforms. To solve these problems, this study proposes a framework focusing on access control, such as authentication and authorization for resource use between various IoT platforms.},

abstract = {Semiconductor manufacturing, particularly wafer fabrication, is a highly complex system of processes and workflows. Fabrication facilities must deal with re-entrant flows to support multiple types of wafers being produced simultaneously, each with their own deadlines and specifications. The manufacturing process itself depends upon the ability to control and programmatically adjust a variety of environmental conditions. In addition, wafer fabrication consumes large amounts of energy, particularly electricity. Emerging technologies including networked devices may help reduce the energy footprint but can introduce cybersecurity risks. Therefore, this paper presents its modeling and simulation framework to quantify tradeoffs between operational measures of performance, energy consumption, and cybersecurity risks. We augment the Intel Minifab model with an Industrial Control Systems (ICS) reference model based on the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) as well as tool-level energy consumption data from a semiconductor manufacturing testbed.},

Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management. This approach provides access and configuration security and data privacy protection.},

In this context, the supply chain has also quickly evolved toward the digital supply chain where digital and electronic technologies have been integrated into every aspect of its end-to-end process. This evolution provides numerous benefits such as profit maximization, loss reduction, and the optimization of supply chain lead times. However, the use of such technologies has also considerably opened up various security threats and risks which have widened the attack surface on the entire end-to-end supply chain. We present a holistic survey on supply chain security. We discuss the different security issues and attacks that target the different supply chain technologies. Then, we discuss various countermeasures and security solutions proposed by academic and industry researchers to mitigate the identified threats. Finally, we provide some recommendations and best practices that can be adopted to achieve a secure supply chain.},

abstract = {The Metaverse, an emerging digital space, is expected to offer various services mirroring the real world. Wireless communications for mobile Metaverse users should be tailored to meet the following user characteristics: 1) emphasizing application-specific perceptual utility instead of simply the transmission rate, 2) concerned with energy efficiency due to the limited device battery and energy intensiveness of some applications, and 3) caring about security as the applications may involve sensitive personal data. To this end, this paper incorporates application-specific utility, energy efficiency, and physical-layer security (PLS) into the studied optimization in a wireless network for the Metaverse. Specifically, after introducing utility-energy efficiency (UEE) to represent each Metaverse user's application-specific objective under PLS, we formulate an optimization to maximize the network's weighted sum-UEE by deciding users' transmission powers and communication bandwidths. The formulated problem belongs to the sum-of-ratios optimization, for which prior studies have demonstrated its difficulty. Nevertheless, our proposed algorithm 1) obtains the global optimum for the weighted sum-UEE optimization, via a transform to parametric convex optimization problems, 2) applies to any utility function which is concave, increasing, and twice differentiable, and 3) achieves a linear time complexity in the number of users (the optimal complexity in the order sense). Simulations confirm the superiority of our algorithm over other approaches. We explain that our technique for solving the sum-of-ratios optimization is applicable to other optimization problems in wireless networks and mobile computing.},

abstract = {Smart grid brings various advantages such as increased automation in decision making, tighter coupling between production and consumption, and increased digitalization. Because of the many changes that the smart grid inflicts on the power grid as critical infrastructure, cyber security and robust resilience against cyberattacks are essential to handle. With an increased number of attack interfaces and more use of IP-enabled communication, digital stations or IEC 61850 substations need to operate according to a zero-trust security model. Cyber resilience needs to be an integrated part of the substation and its components. This paper presents an experiment utilizing a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) Digital Station environment (enclave), where the focus is on attacking the SCADA protocol IEC 60870-5-104. We implemented 14 attacks, the attacks are described in detail, including the result of each attack action. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of the findings in the experiment and what power grid asset owners can do to protect their substations as part of their digitizing efforts.},

abstract = {Industry 5.0 is increasingly having a greater influence on the modernization of industrial processes in order to improve not only its own value chain but also the supply chain within a context. In this case, Digital twins (DTs) is a leading technology, providing simulation capabilities to analyze, predict and optimize possible scenarios and situations, which is encouraging different industrial actors to invest in the technology, and especially to intensify the three Industry 5.0 objectives: centrality in the human being, sustainability, and resilience. But this fact, in turn, forces the scientific community to pay attention to the risks that may be involved in adapting the technology itself in its operational domains. The deployment of a DT involves a set of risks and threats that are a consequence of its own criticality, what affects seriously Industry 5.0 resilience. In this talk, therefore, we will talk about that particular context of a DT, where we will explore potential threats that can corrupt the objectives of Industry 5.0, adding some security recommendations that can benefit, at least, the expected Industry 5.0 resilience.},

This paper introduces a research path towards adaptive safety mechanisms that can support the degree of dynamism and high level of uncertainty introduced by these systems of systems. Our planned approach is to use runtime trust evaluation as a decision factor when enabling or disabling safety features on demand.},

abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are responsible for the safety and operations of critical infrastructure such as power grids. Attacks on such systems threaten the well-being of societies, and the lives of human operators, and pose huge financial risks. To detect those attacks, process-aware attack detectors were proposed by academia and industry to verify inherent physical correlations. Such detectors will be trained by the vendors on process data from the target system, which allows malicious manipulations of the training process to later evade detection at runtime. Previously proposed attacks in this direction rely on detailed process knowledge to predict the exact attack features to be concealed. In this work, we show that even without process knowledge (i.e. being able to predict attack results), it is possible to launch training time attacks against such attack detectors. Our backdoor attacks achieve this by identifying ‘alien’ actuator state combinations that never occur in the training samples and injecting them with legitimate sensor data into the training set. At runtime, the attacker spoofs one of those alien actuator state combinations, which triggers (regardless of sensor values) the classification as ‘normal’. To demonstrate this, we design and implement five backdoor attacks against autoencoder-based anomaly detectors for 14 attacks from the BATADAL dataset collection. Our evaluation shows that our best backdoor attack implementation can achieve perfect attack concealment and accomplish an average recall of 0.19. Compared to the performance of the detector for anomalies that are not concealed by inserted triggers, our attacks decrease the detector’s recall by 0.477.},

abstract = {Background: The vision of a fourth industrial revolution lately strongly captured the attention of research A Cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the main drivers of this vision. Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security.Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0.Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns.Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions.Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results. Our findings highlight areas for future research and provide suggestions for investigation approaches.},

However, the TDs lack a way to describe the physical effect of said interactions on the device itself, as well as on the environment around the device, limiting its viability for cyber-physical scenarios. In this paper, we propose an extension for describing the effects of an interaction on the property affordances of a Thing in the TD as a first step towards a TD that is able to fully describe a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). We show this extension permits the generation of accurate Digital Twins, facilitates machine-aided system design and device mashup generation and allows for formal verification of the functionality of CPSs during their deployment and maintenance.},

Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.},

abstract = {A threat modeling exercise involves systematically assessing the likelihood and potential impact of diverse threat scenarios. As threat modeling approaches and tools act at the level of a software architecture or design (e.g., a data flow diagram), they consider threat scenarios at the level of classes or types of system elements. More fine-grained analyses in terms of concrete instances of these elements are typically not conducted explicitly nor rigorously. This hinders (i) expressiveness, as threats that require articulation at the level of instances can not be expressed nor managed properly, and (ii) systematic risk calculation, as risk cannot be expressed and estimated with respect to instance-level properties.In this paper, we present a novel threat modeling approach that acts on two layers: (i) the design layer defines the classes and entity types in the system, and (ii) the instance layer models concrete instances and their properties. This, in turn, allows both rough risk estimates at the design-level, and more precise ones at the instance-level. Motivated by a connected vehicles application, we present the key challenges, the modeling approach and a tool prototype. The presented approach is a key enabler for more continuous and frequent threat (re-)assessment, the integration of threat analysis models in CI/CD pipelines and agile development environments on the one hand (development perspective), and in risk management approaches at run-time (operations perspective).},

Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically.Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.},

Keeping in view the catastrophic destruction of this devastating virus, there is a must-need situation to maximize the use of existing healthcare technologies such as the healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT). In healthcare, patient wearable devices are widely recognized as a dormant technology with enormous capabilities to assess and combat various diseases, e.g., cough, seizure, temperature, heartbeat, and so on. As we know, in the H-IoT, patient-wearable devices are dispersed in an infrastructure-free environment that exposes them to several private and public coercion while accumulating and transmitting high sensitive data over the wireless communication channel. Therefore, security is the main concern of these applications, and thus, the primary focus of this article to outline the limitations and challenges in the present literature from 2019 to 2021, to identify the requirements of H-IoT applications used in the context of COVID-19. Following this, we will move one step ahead to explore the current security techniques adopted in these applications. Consequently, we will identify the network architectural, cryptographic, protocols, and operational security challenges during our study to recommend viable research directions and opportunities, which could be helpful and capable to minimize the network architecture, deployment, and maintenance cost with more productive outcomes.},

abstract = {We explore the potential of the Graph-Massivizer project funded by the Horizon Europe research and innovation program of the European Union to boost the impact of extreme and sustainable graph processing for mitigating existing urgent societal challenges. Current graph processing platforms do not support diverse workloads, models, languages, and algebraic frameworks. Existing specialized platforms are difficult to use by non-experts and suffer from limited portability and interoperability, leading to redundant efforts and inefficient resource and energy consumption due to vendor and even platform lock-in. While synthetic data emerged as an invaluable resource overshadowing actual data for developing robust artificial intelligence analytics, graph generation remains a challenge due to extreme dimensionality and complexity. On the European scale, this practice is unsustainable and, thus, threatens the possibility of creating a climate-neutral and sustainable economy based on graph data. Making graph processing sustainable is essential but needs credible evidence. The grand vision of the Graph-Massivizer project is a technological solution, coupled with field experiments and experience-sharing, for a high-performance and sustainable graph processing of extreme data with a proper response for any need and organizational size by 2030.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes more and more pervasive, encompassing many aspects of our daily life, the issue of how much the IoT systems can be trusted is critical. However, the multitude of recent incidents that were caused by or somehow involved such systems, often with dire consequences, makes it obvious that IoT system trustworthiness is not yet attained.In this paper we provide an overview on IoT trustworthiness, and introduce a trustworthiness assurance methodology based on the novel concept of Trustworthiness Assurance Levels (TALs). The methodology is intended for analyzing IoT systems to determine the degree of confidence one can have that they will perform as expected for a given deployment, taking into consideration external disturbances, system errors, faults and attacks. The paper also includes a case study discussion to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Visually searching for physical entities can be challenging as other entities often block the targets. The rapid advancement of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and cyber-physical mappings in smart cities may offer an alternative solution, where users can quickly locate the target by manipulating the digital representations of their surrounding environments. For example, a user wearing an HMD can reveal the hidden target by “lifting” the cyber world to create a curved virtual map on top of the physical world. This paper presents a virtual reality (VR)-based preliminary study that investigates how such cyber-physical bending interaction affects visual search tasks. A virtual environment is used to emulate a physical world and its virtual twin. The results demonstrate that vertically bending the virtual twin can significantly improve users’ (N = 20) performance in a city infrastructure inspection task (160% faster) and a landmark navigation task (50% faster) in the virtual city environment.},

abstract = {As power grids have evolved, IT has become integral to maintaining reliable power. While providing operators improved situational awareness and the ability to rapidly respond to dynamic situations, IT concurrently increases the cyberattack threat surface – as recent grid attacks such as Blackenergy and Crashoverride illustrate. To defend against such attacks, modern power grids require a system that can maintain reliable power during attacks and detect when these attacks occur to allow for a timely response. To help address limitations of prior work, we propose DRAGON– deep reinforcement learning for autonomous grid operation and attack detection, which (i) autonomously learns how to maintain reliable power operations while (ii) simultaneously detecting cyberattacks. We implement DRAGON and evaluate its effectiveness by simulating different attack scenarios on the IEEE 14 bus power transmission system model. Our experimental results show that DRAGON can maintain safe grid operations 225.5% longer than a state-of-the-art autonomous grid operator. Furthermore, on average, our detection method reports a true positive rate of 92.9% and a false positive rate of 11.4%, while also reducing the false negative rate by 63.1% compared to a recent attack detection method.},

The advancements in different technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, extended reality (XR), artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G/6G communication will be the key enablers behind the realization of AI-XR metaverse applications. While AI itself has many potential applications in the aforementioned technologies (e.g., avatar generation, network optimization, etc.), ensuring the security of AI in critical applications like AI-XR metaverse applications is profoundly crucial to avoid undesirable actions that could undermine users’ privacy and safety, consequently putting their lives in danger. To this end, we attempt to analyze the security, privacy, and trustworthiness aspects associated with the use of various AI techniques in AI-XR metaverse applications. Specifically, we discuss numerous such challenges and present a taxonomy of potential solutions that could be leveraged to develop secure, private, robust, and trustworthy AI-XR applications. To highlight the real implications of AI-associated adversarial threats, we designed a metaverse-specific case study and analyzed it through the adversarial lens. Finally, we elaborate upon various open issues that require further research interest from the community.},

Power grid is amongst the most essential critical infrastructures, and stable energy production, transmission and distribution are core part of power grids. The modernization of the power grid and the introduction of smart grids have resulted in increased digitalization and a larger uptake of information technology. Substations are core to the power grid, and safe and secure operation of digital substations are essential for a stable smart grid. To better understand, evaluate and prepare for future cyber-attacks, there is a need to leverage a representative information technology and operational technology testbed that are flexible enough to support testing and evaluation of cyber-attacks, evaluation of vulnerabilities, and that can be used for training and testing of incident response procedures.

In doing so, researchers may enhance robot flexibility and broaden the scope of robot deployments into the real world. We introduce PRogramAR (Programming Robots using Augmented Reality), a novel end-user robot programming system that combines the intuitive visual feedback of augmented reality (AR) with the simplistic and responsive paradigm of trigger-action programming (TAP) to facilitate human-robot collaboration. Through PRogramAR, users are able to rapidly author task rules and desired reactive robot behaviors, while specifying task constraints and observing program feedback contextualized directly in the real world. PRogramAR provides feedback by simulating the robot’s intended behavior and providing instant evaluation of TAP rule executability to help end-users better understand and debug their programs during development. In a system validation, 17 end-users ranging from ages 18 to 83 used PRogramAR to program a robot to assist them in completing three collaborative tasks. Our results demonstrate how merging the benefits of AR and TAP using elements from prior robot programming research into a single novel system can successfully enhance the robot programming process for non-expert users.},

They collect data in real time and learn from this data; they control processes automatically or support human decisions; and they communicate and interact through the internet. This is more and more evolving to intercompany interactions based on digital services. In addition to data of isolated assets (e.g. production resources), new capabilities for standard-based data integration and orchestration are necessary to contextualize the interaction of multiple digital twins and services.

The relevant control components are subsequently modeled together with their control dependencies and operational design specifications. The approach was demonstrated and validated on a water treatment testbed. Attacks were simulated on the testbed model where its resilience to attacks was evaluated using proposed metrics such as Impact Ratio and Time-to-Critical-State. From the analysis of the attacks, design strengths and weaknesses were identified and design improvements were recommended to increase the testbed's resilience to attacks.},

abstract = {Resource scarcity is a global challenge, especially in E-mobility. Currently, Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered as an attractive option on a pathway towards low emission mobility. Nevertheless, due to the increasing sales and acceptance of EVs, new challenges arise regarding the scarcity of utilized materials, especially regarding lithium-ion battery systems. Battery production is responsible for the major share of the environmental and economical impacts of the overall EV production. In order to tackle these challenges, resource-efficient processes and a circular use are necessary. Today, a variety of new Industry 4.0 technologies (such as high integrated production systems) are affordable and have reached maturity. Like Industry 4.0, also Recycling 4.0 aims at digitalization of processes but with the focus on the End of Life stage of products. The main goal of the German research project Recycling 4.0 is to develop approaches, which enable advanced information creation, transfer and use along the entire supply chain. In this work, a holistic approach towards an advanced circular economy (Recycling 4.0) is shown. This approach combines methods from different areas (such as economics, mechanical engineering, and computer science) and paves the way towards an advanced circular economy. This paper introduces this approach by discussing the current situation of EV recycling and related judicial fundamentals. Furthermore, the overall approach is introduced, and the discipline-specific sub-approaches are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {This paper presents the lessons learned, and the observations and insights gained, from observing a software development effort for a large, well-funded, and highly regulated program that adopted Agile and DevSecOps principles during a 12-month period of iterative software development. The program was originally set up to use the waterfall software development approach with a traditional earned value (EV) scheme. It completed several iterations of development using this structure. The program then shifted to using a combination of Agile and DevSecOps. In this paper, we describe challenges encountered during this transition that inhibited realization of some of the benefits associated with Agile and DevSecOps. Largely, these challenges were a result of poor planning, engineering, and communication. We present this advisory account to others undertaking similar DevSecOps and Agile transitions, particularly in large organizations, so that they may better strategize and prepare methods to diminish similar shortcomings and increase the odds of a successful transition.},

abstract = {Recent trends in networking are proposing the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the control and operation of the network. In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.},

abstract = {There has been increasing interest in and demand for relevant datasets for machine learning-based anomaly detection research in academia and industry. The industrial control system (ICS) has become larger and more complex, and it is difficult for humans to understand the configuration and operation of the system. Normal and attack scenario plans based on partial knowledge are inevitably biased, and insufficient data annotations limit the performance verification. It is practically difficult to manually identify all tags used for system monitoring and control and their causal relationships. Therefore, we propose a method to generate a data flow graph from process control information such as input/output tags, control processes, and various control parameter values extracted from the database of the control system. It will be the basis for systematic scenario composition and provide information for the analysis of cause and ripple effects when the state of a specific point (control device, sensor, actuator, etc.) is changed. We applied the proposed method to a HAI testbed and confirmed its feasibility by using it to develop a dataset.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical microgrids hold the key to a carbon-neutral power sector since they enable renewable and distributed energy resource integration, can alleviate overloaded distribution systems, and provide economic energy by generating and consuming power locally. The utilization of cyber-physical assets such as controllers, IoT sensors and actuators, and communication devices can enhance the stability and improve the control of microgrids. However, such assets, if maliciously operated, can become attack entry points and jeopardize the grid operation. Blind and uncoordinated cyber-attacks can be identified by existing security measures overcoming potential operational disruptions. However, rootkit attacks can stay hidden within cyber-physical systems and leverage system information to mask their presence. Rootkit detection is a strenuous process and requires advanced security methods due to their sophisticated operation. A careful analysis of possible rootkit target locations and their exploitation techniques is necessary to design effective threat detection and mitigation mechanisms. This paper discusses the cyber kill chain of a rootkit which can simultaneously deploy itself at multiple locations in a microgrid in a coordinated and stealthy way in order to maximize the impact on power system operations. The rootkit leverages system measurements to hide its presence and its attack impact from the detection mechanisms.},

abstract = {The advent of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology has significantly optimized the industrial operations management by connecting industrial assets with information systems and, hence, with business processes. The IIoT forms the backbone for materializing the Industry 4.0 initiative. Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance. Intelligence refers to making optimal decisions for both automated and human-in-the-loop decision making. Condition-based predictive maintenance (CBPdM), also known as Maintenance 4.0, is among the major focus points of the Industry 4.0 and IIoT. In this paper, we discuss the existing standards related to condition-based maintenance and the potential of the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE), a MIMOSA led initiative, as a framework which extends previous open standards for achieving CBPdM. We illustrate how the framework addresses the requirements of Industry 4.0 and CBPdM.},

abstract = {Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. Humanitarian assistance requiring short response time windows in almost the whole world may be subject to long queues due to managing problems, e.g., the lack of control and/or inefficient infrastructure. This work tackles such challenge by proposing a low-cost planning and managing model and method based on a discrete-event simulation mirror connected through WEB tools to a near or far management level. The usual configuration of parallel servers (for instance, supported by local RFID monitoring) is implemented by a discrete-event simulation model that is validated by Jackson Networks (and vice versa). The results show a flexible model that may identify bottlenecks in advance in order to accommodate traffic flow variations.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely acknowledged as one of the most disruptive technologies driving the digital transformation of industries, enterprises, and societies in the 21st century. Advances in computing speed, algorithmic improvements, and access to a vast amount of data contributed to the adaption of AI in many different domains. Due to the outstanding performance, AI technology is increasingly integrated into safety-critical applications. However, the established safety engineering processes and practices have been only successfully applied in conventional model-based system development and no commonly agreed approaches for integrating AI technology are available yet. This work presents two architectural patterns that can support designers and engineers in the conception of safety-critical AI-enhanced cyber-physical system (CPS) applications. The first pattern addresses the problem of integrating AI capabilities into safety-critical functions. The second pattern deals with architectural approaches to integrate AI technologies for monitoring and learning system-specific behavior at runtime.},

abstract = {Co-simulation is an increasingly important topic concerning future Industry 4.0 architectures as well as a part of modern design engineering approaches and testing structures for real production environments. It is an arising well-used enabling technique and is beneficial for the simulation of a coupled system by composing the simulations of its single parts. In this context, standardized information exchange is a requirement among production entities and the whole supply chain. Information models become a fundamental part for describing semantic exchange of data in a standardized way. These models can be customized according to the needs of a specific company or departments. At the moment, the testing of the communication structure and the overall interoperability between the communication partners in a production line is not checked until the real commissioning and later stages of a project. For the functionality and quality of the later established architecture it is still helpful to test information models and their functions in a static as well as a dynamic way beforehand. Oftentimes, an intelligent system is missing that fulfills these requirements of a dynamic and flexible testing. This paper focusses therefore on a concept for a co-simulation environment that accompanies different stages in the planning and virtual commissioning process.},

Firstly, we compare the understanding and expression of the concept, characteristics and supporting technology of metaverse in the research results from different scholars. Considering that there is no authoritative definition of the metaverse, the characteristics and supporting technologies recognized by many studies are summarized. The purpose is to find an indirect consensus on the concept of the metaverse. Secondly, the existing literatures related to metaverse teaching is extracted and sorted out from different angles, including general theoretical research, application exploration research and practical progress. We also point out the existing problems such as more theoretical research than practical application, lack of peer cooperation among scholars and institutions, and wide application difficulties because of practical obstacles. This paper holds that although metaverse teaching is still in its infancy, it has a very broad development prospect because it has greatly broken through the limitations of traditional blended teaching or online teaching in terms of teaching resources, teaching environment and teaching mode. Future research should focus on solving the current predicaments in legal, ethical, technical, cost and other detailed aspects, as well as appropriate forward-looking researches on the teaching of the next generation of metaverse.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that data-driven decision-making facilitated by Digital Twins (DTs) may be essential for optimizing resources and diversifying value creation in production logistics. However, there exists limited understanding about the design of DTs in production logistics. Addressing this issue, this study proposes a process for the design of DTs in production logistics. This study extends related works describing the dimensions of DTs in manufacturing, and adopts a process perspective based on production development literature. The results present a process for the design of DTs including activities in pre-study, conceptual, and detailed design phases corresponding to five DT dimensions. The proposed process is validated during the development of a DT in a production logistics lab at an academic environment. The findings of this study may be essential for avoiding misplaced resources and lost opportunities in the design of DTs in production logistics, and facilitating the planning and resource allocation.},

abstract = {While many network research papers address issues of deployability, with a few exceptions, this has been limited to protocol compatibility or switch-resource constraints, such as flow table sizes. We argue that good network designs must also consider the costs and complexities of deploying the design within the constraints of the physical environment in a datacenter: physical deployability. Traditional metrics of network "goodness" do not account for these costs and constraints, which might explain why some otherwise attractive designs have not been deployed in real-world datacenters.},

abstract = {In a global economy with many competitive participants, licensing and tracking of 3D printed parts is desirable if not mandatory for many use-cases. We investigate a blockchain-based approach, as blockchains provide many attractive features, like decentralized architecture and high security assurances. An often neglected aspect of the product life-cycle management is the confidentiality of transactions to hide valuable business information from competitors. To solve the combined problem of trust and confidentiality, we present a confidential licensing and tracking system which works on any publicly verifiable, token-based blockchain that supports tokens of different types representing licenses or attributes of parts. Together with the secure integration of a unique eID in each part, our system provides an efficient, immutable and authenticated transaction log scalable to thousands of transactions per second. With our confidential Token-Based License Management system (cTLM), large industries such as automotive or aviation can license and trace all parts confidentially.},

abstract = {Responsible AI is widely considered as one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the adoption of AI. Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. Also, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm-level rather than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible AI.},

abstract = {The Metaverse, envisioned as the next-generation Internet, will be constructed via twining a practical world in a virtual form, wherein Meterverse service providers (MSPs) are required to collect massive data from Meterverse users (MUs). In this regard, a critical demand exists for MSPs to motivate MUs to contribute computing resources and data while preserving user privacy. Federated learning (FL), as a privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning paradigm, can support distributed intensive computation in Metaverse. In this work, we first investigate minting the machine learning models into NFT with FL assistance (referred to as FL-NFT), such that MUs as stakeholders can control the ownership and share the economic value of user-generated content (UGC). Specifically, MUs are encouraged to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (i.e., MU-DAO) to aggregate local models and mint FL-NFT. MUs and MSPs optimize the strategies by formulating an imperfect information Stackelberg game (IISG) to trade off the cost and benefit. We apply the backward induction to derive the equilibrium solution. Then, we construct a privacy-preserving multi-winner sealed-bid auction mechanism (PMS-AM), in which the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) assists MSPs in choosing rational bidding strategies according to historical bids, and the double auction mechanism determines the winners and price of FL-NFT. Finally, the numerical results based on theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed PMS-AM can increase the quality of FL-NFT and achieve the economic properties of incentive mechanisms such as individual rationality and incentive compatibility.},

abstract = {Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs) are made of droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (the same material under the screen of our mobile phones) but molded in a spherical shape and hardened into a solid. CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have gained popularity due to the increased requirements on their uninterrupted connectivity and process automation. Due to their connectivity over the network including intranet and internet, dependence on sensitive data, heterogeneous nature, and large-scale deployment, they are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are performed by creating anomalies in the normal operation of the systems with a goal either to disrupt the operation or destroy the system completely. The study proposed here focuses on detecting those anomalies which could be the cause of cyber-attacks. This is achieved by deriving the rules that govern the physical behavior of a process within a plant. These rules are called Invariants. We have proposed a Data-Centric approach (DaC) to generate such invariants. The entire study was conducted using the operational data of a functional smart power grid which is also a living lab.},

We deployed an indoor positioning system within the school library that leverages 550 Bluetooth beacons, covering an area of approximately 12,000 square meters. This system allows users to engage with location-aware book navigation services via a web interface on their mobile devices. Upon locating a book of interest, the system enters navigation mode, updating and guiding users based on their current location within the library. Utilizing the users’ positional data and borrowing history, the system is capable of recommending other potentially interesting books, exhibits, and library events. The system went live in February 2023, with a recorded usage sessions of 21,540 instances which includes 17,271 uses of the retrieval services and 2,065 indoor navigation services, as of May 2023. This paper outlines the system architecture of this large-scale indoor LBS, shares user engagement data, and after anonymization, makes this data publicly available for academic analysis and research. We are hoping that our experience can shed light on the understanding and future development of large-scale indoor LBS technologies.},

abstract = {Systems-of-systems (SoS) have become increasingly complex and frequently used in highly distributed, dynamic, and open environments. SoS refer to evolving software systems in which constituent systems (themselves systems in their own right) cooperatively work to fulfill specific, complex missions, facing Software Engineering researchers and practitioners with substantial challenges. Software ecosystems (SECO) have also become an important research topic, addressing social issues along with technical aspects of software development. SoS and SECO are closely related and naturally distributed in development teams. In both fields, distributed resources aim at reducing cost and reaching new Information Technology markets. Software Engineering-related problems and challenges are amplified and become more critical when SoS and SECO are analyzed together. The 10th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS 2022) celebrates a decade of promoting a forum to exchange ideas and experiences, analyze research and development issues, discuss promising solutions, and propose theoretical foundations for the development and evolution of complex software-intensive systems, inspiring visions for the future of Software Engineering for SoS and SECO, as well as paving the way for a more structured community effort. Based on the community feedback, topics of interest should address systems thinking and complexity of those types of systems. As such, the SESoS community is reflecting on how the different dimensions of those types of systems - technological, organizational, and social - should be addressed in research and practice.},

These include the IBM Cloud Application Lab (based on the original Apache VCL open source cloud platform), Learn@IBM (a Moddle-based collection of educational modules initially developed by CAS Canada Lab), a library of pre-packaged software images and platforms popular with many academicians, and more - integrated with many of the most requested IBM services (including IBM Watson and AI, IoT, blockchain and more).Many of these images, platforms and modules have been created in partnership with university collaborators for their specific academic needs (including the Apache VCL cloud platform itself). The IBM Cloud for Education is therefore intended to become a repository of cloud-based reusable assets that are being developed for courses or projects around data/AI, security, blockchain, quantum computing and more. Most importantly, these solutions can be easily hybridized with an institution's on-premise infrastructure or edge devices, can support any operating system or hypervisor - as well as Kubernetes - and can be accessed by a simple browser on any device. They can even be deployed within any third party vendor's hosted cloud.},

abstract = {Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based models of CPS (also called Digital Twins) are becoming important in the design and control of modern CPS. CPS are a unique class of intelligent system, where the governing process models for the system (or its parts) are available to inform decision making. The governing physics or chemistry models provide an additional source of information, potentially improving the accuracy of CPS modeling, but also increasing the complexity of the information fusion process. The resource constraints of CPS, however, makes it hard to perform the information fusion within the CPS itself. Moreover, building a large, monolithic model of the complete CPS is also infeasible due to model size and training complexity. The hierarchical and compositional structure of CPS calls for distributed model training and composition. Resource constraints and real-time control needs call for rapid and low-cost training of models, which makes surrogate modeling a promising approach. However, when surrogate models are composed, their approximate nature may lead to larger errors. Further, data-driven models are prone to adversarial attacks, whose impacts may be even more pronounced in a federated model. This position paper highlights the key research challenges in this realm and need for new research.},

abstract = {Whether testing intrusion detection systems, conducting training exercises, or creating data sets to be used by the broader cybersecurity community, realistic user behavior is a critical component of a cyber range. Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user’s behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data—Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer—are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.},

abstract = {5G is the new generation of mobile communication and many scientists are doing research on it. Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) has been proposed to be a core function in 5G. And the intention is that NWDAF does different analysis tasks on the network data in order to improve the network functionalities and also the third-party applications. Data Science is a field of science which has gained great attention in the last years due to the rising amount of generated data and the necessity to extract information from it. Condition monitoring is an approach to maintain the machinery in industry and especially in the past years using AI/ML methods, scientists could achieve a lot in this field. In this paper we first discuss all the above mentioned topics in more detail, then we propose a data analysis platform using NWDAF in a smart factory scenario. The idea is to apply condition monitoring on the machines’ status which are connected via the 6G network.},

abstract = {Edge Computing (EC) leverages edge devices to provide computational and analytical capabilities, reducing the load and response time of cloud servers and ensuring the real-time processing of tasks. However, the capacity of edge devices is limited and requires rational allocation of computational and storage resources to reduce delay, energy consumption, and cost. AS one of the research hotspots in machine learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) can optimize resource allocation strategies for EC to maximize task rewards and make edge devices more intelligent. This study comprehensively reviews the literature on offloading, caching, joint offloading and caching in EC by RL, as well as classifies and compares them. The works of the computational offloading problem are further divided into three parts according to optimization objectives: reducing delay, reducing energy consumption, and the trade-off between energy consumption and delay. EC for different application scenarios is also summarized. Lastly, this paper outlines the main directions for future research and the challenges faced in this field.CCS CONCEPTS • Computing Methodologies},

abstract = {The insurance field is going through a phase of great transformation due to the growth of new technologies and techniques that are causing a change in the way data is handled and analyzed. The main perpetrator of this phenomenon is the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) in financial decision-making due to their efficiency and productivity. However, there is a new intervenient in the room, which will automate and support all steps of ML system development. Machine Learning Operations (MLOPs) will reduce technical friction, so that the model may move from an idea into production, in the shortest amount of time, and subsequently to market with the least possible risk. In this paper, a detailed review of the impacts of ML on insurance premium forecasting and the influence that MLOPs can have on forecasting outcomes is provided. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary is presented of crucial principles in the insurance industry, which are essential for comprehending the role that MLOPs will play in tailoring and individualizing insurance policies and premiums.},

abstract = {Edge computing is a new development paradigm that brings computational power to the network edge through novel intelligent end-user services. It allows latency-sensitive applications to be placed where the data is created, thus reducing communication overhead and improving security, mobility and power consumption. There is a plethora of applications benefiting from this type of processing. Of particular interest is emerging edge-based image classification at the microscopic level. The scale and magnitude of the objects to segment, detect and classify are very challenging, with data collected using order of magnitude in magnification. The required data processing is intense, and the wish list of end-users in this space includes tools and solutions that fit into a desk-based device. Taking heavy-lift classification models initially built in the cloud to desk-based image analysis devices is a hard job for application developers. This work looks at the performance limitations and energy consumption footprint in embedding deep learning classification models in a representative edge computing device. Particularly, the dataset and heavy-lift models explored in the case study are phytoplankton images to detect Harmful Algae Blooms (HAB) in aquaculture at early stages. The work takes a deep learning model trained for phytoplankton classification and deploys it at the edge. The embedded model, deployed in a base form alongside optimised options, is submitted to a series of system stress experiments. The performance and power consumption profiling help understand system limitations and their impact on the microscopic grade image classification task.},

abstract = {Access control for information has primarily focused on access statically granted to subjects by administrators usually in the context of a specific system. Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resource being protected and be generated dynamically by resources depending on the context in which the resource is being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.},

abstract = {In order to extract power lines in real time and accurately from aerial images of low-voltage distribution overhead lines with complex background and serious occlusion, a low-voltage overhead line recognition algorithm based on graph convolutional neural network was proposed. First, the original image is preprocessed by grayscale and Gaussian filtering. Second, a modified conventional convolutional neural network model is used to locate and identify power lines and auxiliary objects in foreground images. Finally, the post-processing module based on the graph convolutional neural network judges the power lines according to the adjacency relationship of each candidate target, to ensure the precise identification and removal of incorrect power line classifications, our objective is to achieve real-time, high-precision identification of overhead lines within the low-voltage distribution network. The experimental results show that compared with other methods such as YOLOV4, this method has the highest accuracy and extraction speed, and the mAP value can reach 93.6%, which meets the needs of practical work.},

Although most smartphones have adopted biometrics-based authentication, after a couple of failed attempts, most users are given the option to quickly bypass the system with passcodes. To add a layer of security, two-factor authentication (2FA) has been implemented but has proven to be vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we introduce VibPath, a simultaneous 2FA scheme that can understand the user's hand neuromuscular system through touch behavior. VibPath captures the individual's vibration path responses between the hand and the wrist with the attention-based encoder-decoder network, authenticating the genuine users from the imposters unobtrusively. In a user study with 30 participants, VibPath achieved an average performance of 0.98 accuracy, 0.99 precision, 0.98 recall, 0.98 f1-score for user verification, and 94.3% accuracy for user identification across five passcodes. Furthermore, we also conducted several extensive studies, including in-the-wile, permanence, vulnerability, usability, and system overhead studies, to assess the practicability and viability of the VibPath from multiple aspects.},

abstract = {This paper studies the construction of accounting degree case base at home and abroad in the metauniverse era. Firstly, it analyses the significance of the construction of accounting degree case base. By the end of 2021, the number of master of professional accounting training institutions in China will have increased from 24 to 298. At the same time, it explains the connotation and main technology of meta-universe. Metacosmic technologies include 5G, 6G, cloud computing, edge computing, Internet of things, holographic projection, digital twinning, block chain, VR/AR/MR/XR and other technologies. Secondly, it analyses the development process and characteristics of Chicago case, Harvard case and Ivey case in Canada. The use of Harvard case allows to solve complex management problems compared to Chicago style. The 8-step strategy for case development at Ivey Business School in Canada includes three styles, two parts and seven parts of case writing. In 1998, the case of Ivey Business School Press has been distributed to more than 100 universities and enterprises in 20 countries. This paper analyses the shortcomings of case study courses and case construction of accounting major in China. Thirdly, this paper puts forward the enlightenment of foreign case teaching to the training of accounting talents: Based on the experience of case studies in developed countries, pay attention to the difference between accounting case teaching and accounting case teaching; advocate the general idea of "four-dimensional" accounting case development. Finally, the paper constructs the technical framework model of the construction of the case database of accounting professional degree in the meta-universe. The research conclusion shows that, under the background of meta-universe, the case database ecology of accounting professional database is built on the basis of meta-universe equipment and meta-universe underlying technology, to construct the ecological map of the original universe accounting case database, and on this basis to carry out the meta-universe accounting case database comprehensive intelligent analysis system, digital mining, case recommendation and other services. Improve the accounting professional database case use accuracy, enhance the sense of experience. The organic combination of meta-universe and accounting case database construction will inject new vitality into the teaching reform of professional degree postgraduates. The deep integration of foreign case study experience and meta-universe new technology will certainly bring about subversive changes in teaching research. Meta-universe can make contributions to accounting case teaching. Metauniverse changes the traditional accounting case teaching mode. Firstly, the application of meta-universe technology in accounting case teaching can enhance students' sense of teaching experience and give them an immersive feeling. Secondly, meta-universe technolog has also promoted the transformation of accounting case teaching from traditional teaching methods to information-based teaching methods. Accounting case teaching can not only simulate the offline teaching mode through metacosmic technology, but also use the characteristics of virtual world to completely change the teaching mode of accounting case teaching. By using meta-universe experiential accounting case teaching, we can improve the teaching effectiveness, solve the shortage of accounting case teachers, and meet the needs of students to learn accounting cases at any time.},

The many technologies developed in Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs) and through proprietary solutions bear witness to this continuous evolution, often driven through specifying and implementing new communication protocols or design practises. Parts of those solutions may overload, amend, or extend packet header semantics at the risk of endangering inter-operability of the solutions that make up the Internet system. This discussion paper advocates the Semantic Networking vision, explicitly exposing communication semantics as the essential abstraction for its runtime realization.

It is imperative to improve our understanding of Resilient and Intelligent Cities in order to leverage these new technologies to tackle the challenges ranging from climate change, public health, traffic congestion, economic growth, to digital divide, social equity, political movements, and cultural conflicts, among others.},

abstract = {A central vision of the Internet of Things is the representation of the physical world in a consistent virtual environment. Especially in the context of smart factories the connection of the different, heterogeneous production modules through a digital shop floor promises faster conversion rates, data-driven maintenance or automated machine configurations for use cases which haven't been recognized at design time. Nevertheless, these scenarios demand IoT representations of all participating machines and components, which requires high installation efforts and hardware adjustments. We propose an incremental process for bringing the shop floor closer to the IoT vision. Currently the majority of systems, components or parts are not yet connected with the internet and might not even provide the possibility to be technically equipped with sensors. However, those could be essential parts for a realistic digital shop floor representation. We therefore propose Virtual Representations, which are capable of independently calculating a physical object's condition by dynamically collecting and interpreting already available data through RESTful Web APIs. The internal logic of such Virtual Representations are further adjustable at runtime since changes to its respective physical object, its environment or updates to the resource itself should not cause any downtime.},

abstract = {Rapid technology advancement, economic growth, and industrialization have paved the way for developing a new niche of small body-worn personal devices, gathered together under a wearable-technology title. The triggers stimulated by end-users interest have introduced the first generation of mass-consumer wearables in just the past decade. Evidently, the trailblazing ones were not designed with strict energy-consumption restrictions in mind. Thus, wearable-computing-related research remained fragmented. Advanced and sophisticated batteries and communication technologies could be already procurable on devices. Additional solutions for efficient utilization of processing power are still a white spot on the wearable technology roadmap. A-WEAR EU project aims to enhance the understanding of how the superimposition of those technologies would improve wearable devices' energy efficiency, with the research area being far from saturation. We foresee enormous room for research as the Edge computing paradigm is emerging towards hand-held devices.},

In this paper, CiteSpace citation analysis software is used as an analysis tool and big data related literature in the Web of Science core database during 2011- 2021 is used as an analysis object. The major task is to create the knowledge map of big data with multi-dimension, build knowledge graphs of big data from several perspectives and develop visual analyses of the literature. From the sight of time and space. Differences between the numbers and the research contents of literature on big data published by different countries, regions, and institutions have been analyzed and compared; By co-cited literature, the classical papers and core literature in the field of big data have been detected, and the development context of big data domain have been clarified; Cluster analysis has been conducted on hot keywords to find the research hotspots of big data domain in recent years. Burst words detection algorithm has been used to track the research frontiers and development trends in the field of big data. The results show that China has surpassed the developed countries in Europe and the United States in the number of literature on big data. However, there is still a lack of core technology literature. The development of big data and AI will be in the same direction and depend on each other; The improvement of deep learning algorithms based of big data analysis is going to become a frontier research topic in a long-term; The integration of big data and all walks of life should to be deepened, and researchers need to find the breakthrough points for the application of big data based on the characteristics of the industry.},

They use media that degrades over time and has a limited lifetime, which leads to inefficient, wasteful, and costly solutions for long-lived data. This paper presents Silica: the first cloud storage system for archival data underpinned by quartz glass, an extremely resilient media that allows data to be left in situ indefinitely. The hardware and software of Silica have been co-designed and co-optimized from the media up to the service level with sustainability as a primary objective. The design follows a cloud-first, data-driven methodology underpinned by principles derived from analyzing the archival workload of a large public cloud service. Silica can support a wide range of archival storage workloads and ushers in a new era of sustainable, cost-effective storage.},

abstract = {The prevalence of IoT enabled devices in the home has manifested in buildings as voice and gesture enabled devices that enable functions such as optimizing energy usage and controlling electrical fixtures. However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building's design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an "operating system" for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency. Methods for personalizing building performance to users can also be accomplished through the proposed methodology.},

However, using trajectory datasets can also be challenging, particularly in different countries. This article aims to explore the challenges of using trajectory datasets, specifically using focus group discussions. Focus groups are a qualitative method of gaining a deeper understanding of a particular topic and have not been previously used to examine the challenges related to trajectory datasets.

abstract = {Network delay is a crucial indicator for realizing delay-sensitive task offloading, network management, and optimization in B5G/6G edge computing networks. However, the delay prediction for edge networks becomes complicated due to diverse access strategies and heterogeneous services' storage, computing, and communication resource requirements. Current GNN-based delay prediction models such as RouteNet and PLNet lack the ability to express the complex associations between links and paths, so the predicted delay is not accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end delay prediction model named MixerNet for edge computing, which is based on the mixed multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In this model, a mixed MLP architecture is applied to represent the association between links in the network topology and various paths. Observing that each link may have different effects on various paths, a weight matrix is then defined and multiplied by the path matrix to express it. Thus, a complete mapping frame from network characteristics (e.g., traffic intensity and routing schemes) to delay indicator is constructed. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on NSFNET and GEANT2 datasets and regard RouteNet as the baseline model. Experimental results show that MixerNet can accurately predict end-to-end delay results on various network topologies and the mean absolute error is merely about 0.36%. MixerNet also outperforms the baseline model in most evaluation indicators, especially the mean square error has a 3-fold decrease in NSFNET.},

Several opportunities and risks are identified through a literature review, proof-of-concept implementation, and focus group sessions. Factory representatives raise concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the reliability of LLMs in high-stake environments. By following design guidelines regarding persistent memory, real-time data integration, security, privacy, and ethical concerns, LLM-powered CAs can become valuable assets in manufacturing settings and other industries.},

abstract = {Alarm correlation refers to identifying the correlation between alarms in the system through technical means, accurately categorizing alarms caused by the same problem, and realizing root cause location. Accurate and efficient alarm association identification technology is of great practical significance to accelerate system troubleshooting and ensure the safety of large systems. This paper innovatively proposes a link prediction model considering community similarity and resource allocation between nodes. Based on the application scenario of alarm association knowledge graph, the key innovative technologies and innovation paths in this field are mined and identified, and the potential technological development trends are predicted in the future. Based on the information of 431 invention patents related to alarm correlation in China from 2006 to 2022 and 535 papers from 1998 to 2023, the alarm correlation knowledge map is constructed, and key technologies are identified by topology analysis method. An improved link prediction method is proposed combining community discovery method and resource allocation index, and the potential innovation path of alarm association field is predicted based on the improved index, so as to comprehensively analyze the application status and development prospect of alarm association technology. It is found that technologies such as multilevel classification and causal knowledge will produce innovative results in the fields of alarm clustering and intrusion detection. The research will provide reference for technology prediction in the field of knowledge graph and scientific research innovation of network security personnel.},

The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled increased autonomy and closer human-robot cooperation in the production and manufacturing industry, thus leading to Autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems (ACPPS) and paving the way to the fifth industrial revolution (i.e., Industry 5.0). ACPPS are increasingly critical due to the possible consequences of their malfunctions on human co-workers, and therefore, evaluating their trustworthiness is essential. This paper reviews research trends, relevant attributes, modelling languages, and tools related to the model-based trustworthiness evaluation of ACPPS. As in many other engineering disciplines and domains, model-based approaches, including stochastic and formal analysis tools, are essential to master the increasing complexity and criticality of ACPPS and to prove relevant attributes such as system safety in the presence of intelligent behaviors and uncertainties.},

abstract = {In recent years, aiming to enhance and extend user experiences beyond the real world, Extended Reality (XR) has emerged to become a new paradigm that enables a plethora of applications [1], e.g., online gaming, online conferencing, social media, etc. XR refers to the human-machine interactions that combine real and virtual environments with the support of computing/communications technologies and wearable devices. The XR content is generated by providers or other users, including audio, video and other metadata. In general, the generated XR content is transmitted to XR devices and rendered into XR scenes (i.e., to generate an image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a computer program), where users can experience a hybrid experience of the real and virtual worlds.},

abstract = {Multi-cloud computing is a vitally important topic from both busi-ness and technical perspectives since it guarantees resiliency, avail-ability, and security. Due to the vast number of configurations among cloud providers, it is quite challenging to migrate AIOps models across different clouds. Although it is possible to train these models from scratch on the target cloud, this process can be time-consuming and prone to delays. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to create a generalized AIOps model from the original cloud that can be seamlessly applied to target cloud with minimal to zero-shot observations. To achieve this goal, we present a novel framework in this position paper, which harnesses the potential of digital twins to enhance data generalization. Additionally, our proposed framework employs meta-learning techniques to ensure effective model generalization across different cloud environments.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves to the digital era, improving the collaboration among its partners using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) tools. In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides to smart buildings novel mechanisms to embed Internet of Things (IoT) architectures, as well as to perform end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing between project actors. However, this openness and high decentralization of BIM and IoT services of smart buildings leads to several security issues that the use of Blockchain has been proved to provide an effective layer of data protection. This paper examines the interconnection and interoperability of BIM, IoT, Blockchain and advanced digital technologies in the demanding environment of a museum, where efficient and secure monitoring and management are critical factors that should be satisfied. It focuses on the application of the aforementioned technologies in the context of a building that has to deal with multiple administrative requirements, the management and protection of the exhibition areas and the objects exposed in them, the security and the convenience of the visitors, the financial management of the tickets and the profits from museum shops, the workshops, the laboratories and the storage areas, which usually contain numerous invaluable artifacts.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has experienced a boom in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck, while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.},

abstract = {One of the major steps between (re-)configuration of a factory and the start of production is the commissioning phase, where certification of safety requirements and assessment of potential hazards is a key activity. Typically, assessment of safety risks is a manual process that incorporates the experience and knowledge of the involved stakeholders. The flexibility and the speed gained by automated (re-)configuration of production environments is decelerated by the manual safety certification process, before the factory can start production. This paper is an attempt to eliminate this bottleneck by proposing a model-driven approach to safety risk assessment. An approach based on several models of safety risks enables potential safety risks to be "instantiated" for any given factory at hand. This shortens the recurring process of identifying the risks. A model-driven approach was chosen to capture and utilize the tacit knowledge of the involved stakeholders.},

For Cyber-Physical System (CPS) development, CI/CD can help achieving required goals, such as high dependability, yet it may be challenging to apply. This article empirically investigates challenges, barriers, and their mitigation occurring when applying CI/CD practices to develop CPSs in 10 organizations working in eight different domains. The study has been conducted through semi-structured interviews, by applying an open card sorting procedure together with a member-checking survey within the same organizations, and by validating the results through a further survey involving 55 professional developers. The study reveals several peculiarities in the application of CI/CD to CPSs. These include the need for (i) combining continuous and periodic builds while balancing the use of Hardware-in-the-Loop and simulators, (ii) coping with difficulties in software deployment (iii) accounting for simulators and Hardware-in-the-Loop differing in their behavior, and (vi) combining hardware/software expertise in the development team. Our findings open the road toward recommenders aimed at supporting the setting and evolution of CI/CD pipelines, as well as university curricula requiring interdisciplinarity, such as knowledge about hardware, software, and their interplay.},

abstract = {In the domain of bike route planning for urban environments, the solutions provided by large corporations (e.g. Google Maps, Waze-Google) are not tailored for this particular vehicle or do not reflect path cost structures that human interactions and agglomerations produce. Bikepath expenses different from the usual Euclidean or City-Block distance functions but relevant in a city relate to safety (in terms of accidents or criminality), slopes, path roughness, time-dependent (i.e. rush hour) costs, etc. To partially overcome these disadvantages, this manuscript presents the implementation of a bike route planning algorithm in a urban environment, which efficiently solves the problem of presenting the biker with a low cost route. At the same time, our application allows flexibility in the degree of usage of dedicated bike routes built by the city. This flexibility obeys to city regulations, which may prescribe more or less priority in the usage of dedicated bikepaths. Our algorithm integrates bike dispensers, bike routes, variety of costs (additional to travel length) and finds the suggested routes in a constrained Delaunay graph. The execution of the algorithm is enhanced by using the fact that large part of the travel might be pre-computed if the biker must pick up and return the city-provided bikes in specific dispenser points. Future work is needed in (a) adding more flexible heuristics as the city may decide to prioritize diverse environmental, economic, or transportation goals, (b) transcending canonical metrics, e.g. by considering non-symmetrical costs (d(p, q) ≠ d(q, p)).},

abstract = {In Over the last few years, Machine Learning (ML), and particularly Deep Learning (DL), has made great strides and has been successfully deployed in many real-world applications such as healthcare, customer care, finance, autonomous driving etc. One of the recent applications of deep learning has been in healthcare. ML/DL techniques have been applied to healthcare in medical imaging, clinical decision making, electronic healthcare records processing etc. In particular, Federated Learning (FL), an important sub-area of DL has been considered as a critical part of advancing ML driven healthcare systems in a data siloed healthcare ecosystem. FL addresses the critical need to train ML/DL algorithms without needing to move data to a central location. This tutorial is intended to provide a high-level overview of DL4HC at a major data science/ML research venue such as CODS-COMAD to focus research attention in this emerging area. This tutorial provides a detailed overview of DL/FL techniques in healthcare. While there has been considerable progress in this area, several challenges remain, especially in applying probabilistic techniques to healthcare which often requires deterministic correctness, interpretability, and verifiability. We discuss the various challenges involved in applying DL/FL techniques to healthcare and outline some of the future research directions. We believe that having this tutorial at CODS-COMAD would be an important step in facilitating increased research focus from data science community and greater collaboration with mainstream healthcare community on this topic.},

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) as an integrated part of ETSI standard 5G architecture promises better user experience, resource utilization and application performance by bringing computing and storage facilities at the edge of the network, closer to the data sources. Urban informatics, which is used for better realization of future smart cities, can leverage the power of MEC for real-time analysis and inference from massive amount of multimodal sensory data. This tutorial focuses on the scope and capabilities of MEC in the broad domain of urban informatics. We will discuss MEC fundamentals including the architecture, major technology enablers like SDN, NFV, etc., specific challenges covering resource management, offloading, caching and migration of content/task, and future research directions. Then we plan to motivate the audience with the relevance and scope of further research in urban computing and urban informatics giving special attention to urban information systems (UIS). The premise of UIS management revolves around sensing, forwarding, and processing of real-time multimodal sensory data at the network edge. Finally we bring in the challenges associated with MEC based data management for different application verticals covering health, pollution, transportation, governance and so on with a specific case study in the connected/autonomous vehicles domain.},

In order to accurately identify the key nodes of high-speed railway and further improve the protection ability, we carried out the data mining on the two aspects of supply and demand of high-speed railway. Considering the functional characteristics of high-speed railway transportation and the imbalance between supply and demand, the paper analyzesd the complex network of high-speed railway, which is first upgraded to the directed transportation network and then reduced to the undirected hierarchical network. And the marginal utility model and the competitive opportunity gravity model were used as the supply and demand indexes, and the comprehensive analysis of high-speed railway network is carried out by the method of comprehensive quantification of damage utility to quantify the protection priority value of the network system. The results of case analysis showed that the difference of network demand was obvious, and the fluctuation of supply difference was small. Compared with single analysis, the comprehensive analysis result was more accurate and instructive, which reduced the mistake of subjective judgment based on previous empiricism due to the limitation of people's consciousness, and provided theoretical basis for the decision-making of high-speed railway network protection priority and the allocation of protection resources.},

IoT affords the potential to couple machine-to-machine intercommunication and real-time information-gathering within the industry domain. Hence, the enactment of IoT in the industry magnifies effective optimization, authority, and data-driven judgment. However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution. Finally, we conclude this survey with an inherent discussion of open challenges and directions for future research.},

abstract = {The scope of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has stretched beyond manufacturing to include energy, healthcare, transportation, and all that tomorrow’s smart cities will entail. The realm of IIoT includes smart sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems (DCS), embedded devices, supervisory control, and data acquisition systems—all produced by manufacturers for different purposes and with different data structures and formats; designed according to different standards and made to follow different protocols. In this sea of incompatibility, how can we flexibly acquire these heterogeneous data, and how can we uniformly structure them to suit thousands of different applications? In this article, we survey the four pillars of information science that enable collaborative data access in an IIoT—standardization, data acquisition, data fusion, and scalable architecture—to provide an up-to-date audit of current research in the field. Here, standardization in IIoT relies on standards and technologies to make things communicative; data acquisition attempts to transparently collect data through plug-and-play architectures, reconfigurable schemes, or hardware expansion; data fusion refers to the techniques and strategies for overcoming heterogeneity in data formats and sources; and scalable architecture provides basic techniques to support heterogeneous requirements. The article also concludes with an overview of the frontier researches and emerging technologies for supporting or challenging data access from the aspects of 5G, machine learning, blockchain, and semantic web.},

abstract = {In the development of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare, human-centered approaches seek to meet the requirements of healthcare practice and address social and ethical aspects proactively. In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.},

It provides standards for communication and interaction with Things in the IoT in order to address IoT cross-domain and cross-platform interoperability problems and reduce its fragmentation. WoT uses a formal interface description called Thing Description (TD) which describes the offerings of Things to allow the interaction in between Things. Although Things undergo changes with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications during their lifetime, the WoT TD is currently inteded to be of a static nature. This remains contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things along their lifecycle. This work researches the lifecycle aspect for Things in the IoT and the different stakeholders influencing Things and respectively their TD. These two concepts were combined to develop a versioning mechanism for a TD through the lifecycle of a Thing.},

abstract = {Although AI is transforming the world, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.},

In this system, the machine will learn based on the situation that has been made by any occurrence. In this work Raspberry Pi-based system helps to make a proper analysis of the machines. Voltage, current, gas value, and temperate values are taken as input parameters. Machine learning matches/compares these real-time sensor data with training data (which is used to train the system). As a result, The machine learning module provides some statistics graphs of sensor data. Machine performance can analyze by observing these graphs. Also, determine the efficiency and predict the possibility of upcoming threats or risks.},

abstract = {Tracking hemodynamic responses to treatment and stimuli over long periods remains a grand challenge. Moving from established single-heartbeat technology to longitudinal profiles would require continuous data describing how the patient's state evolves, new methods to extend the temporal domain over which flow is sampled, and high-throughput computing resources. While personalized digital twins can accurately measure 3D hemodynamics over several heartbeats, state-of-the-art methods would require hundreds of years of wallclock time on leadership scale systems to simulate one day of activity. To address these challenges, we propose a cloud-based, parallel-in-time framework leveraging continuous data from wearable devices to capture the first 3D patient-specific, longitudinal hemodynamic maps. We demonstrate the validity of our method by establishing ground truth data for 750 beats and comparing the results. Our cloud-based framework is based on an initial fixed set of simulations to enable the wearable-informed creation of personalized longitudinal hemodynamic maps.},

abstract = {Although there are methods of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to virtual reality (VR) solutions, there are few studies in the literature. Thus, to fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of these methods. In this review, we apply a methodology proposed in the literature that locates existing studies, selects and evaluates contributions, analyses, and synthesizes data. We used Google Scholar and databases such as Elsevier's Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select documents. The results showed that when AI methods are used in VR applications, the main advantages are high efficiency and precision of algorithms. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is the most applied AI scientific technique in VR applications. In conclusion, this paper showed that the combination of AI and VR contributes to new trends, opportunities, and applications for human-machine interactive devices, education, agriculture, transport, 3D image reconstruction, and health. We also concluded that the usage of AI in VR provides potential benefits in other fields of the real world such as teleconferencing, emotion interaction, tourist services, and image data extraction.},

This paper introduces a more general problem, called Machine Learning based Early Decision Making (ML-EDM), which consists in optimizing the decision times of models in a wide range of settings where data is collected over time. After defining the ML-EDM problem, ten challenges are identified and proposed to the scientific community to further research in this area.

The Metaverse is an upcoming technology that combines big data, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies to reduce the gap between online and offline contact. It wants to be a place where we may work, travel, communicate, shop, play, and mingling. When a person joins the Metaverse, they all engage with the virtual environment in some way using data. Data will continue to increase as the Metaverse is developed and used, creating a big data network that will put a tremendous amount of pressure on the digital world's process data ability. Therefore, one of the crucial technologies to construct the Metaverse is large data processing technology. In this study, we thoroughly analyze how Metaverse is transforming large data. Furthermore, we go into great length about the important security and privacy of Metaverse large data. Finally, we provide a summary of the Metaverse's current challenges and potential as well as its prospects for using big data. With this survey, we hope to give researchers ideas for future research and the potential of using big data in the Metaverse.},

abstract = {Data lakes have emerged as a solution for managing vast and diverse datasets for modern data analytics. To prevent them from becoming ungoverned, semantic data management techniques are crucial, which involve connecting metadata with knowledge graphs, following the principles of Linked Data. This semantic layer enables more expressive data management, integration from various sources and enhances data access utilizing the concepts and relations to semantically enrich the data. Some frameworks have been proposed, but requirements like data versioning, linking of datasets, managing machine learning projects, automated semantic modeling and ontology-based data access are not supported in one uniform system. We demonstrate SEDAR, a comprehensive semantic data lake that includes support for data ingestion, storage, processing, and governance with a special focus on semantic data management. The demo will showcase how the system allows for various ingestion scenarios, metadata enrichment, data source linking, profiling, semantic modeling, data integration and processing inside a machine learning life cycle.},

abstract = {The rapid development of digital technologies and technological progress creates significant problems for the existing global economic system and generates innovative business and production models, making it impossible for the country to jump over the traditional paths of economic development.Over a period of less than 20 years, digital technologies have spread around the world at a galloping pace, thereby severing ties with previous spirals of economic and technological development through technological innovations and production technologies, while changing consumer perception of a product or service, social interaction, production, legal framework, financial institutions and government. The digital economy, which includes a wide range of IT technologies in business processes and models, helps to stimulate demand growth, leading to an increase in productivity and employment of the population, has the potential to achieve inclusive results.In the context of rapid digitalization, it is becoming clear that digital innovation, called digital transformation, is becoming the main driving force behind social transformation. The transition to sustainable development and for all must be consistent with the goals, risks, opportunities and dynamics of the digitalization of the economy. At the same time, digital transformation will radically change all processes occurring in the global economy and every state, therefore, it will change the interpretation of the very paradigm of sustainable development. Digitization is not only a "tool" for addressing sustainable development challenges but also a fundamental driver of disruptive change.Advanced technologies are now the driving force behind what has been dubbed Industry 4.0, with the potential to transform Russia's industrial sectors and significant social, economic and environmental impacts on society. This digital transformation of business and society in Russia represents a huge growth potential for the country in the context of the stagnation of the global consumer market and its transition to a digital environment.},

abstract = {The complexity and uncertainty in Supply Chain Management (SCM) has grown radically over the last years. New technologies provide an avenue for improving SCM activities. In particular, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is one of the technological advances that has received quite some attention in SCM literature. However, especially for smaller countries such as Austria, the actual status of IoT application in SCM is low and research is often limited to analyzing theoretical potentials. The current paper elaborates the status-quo of IoT in eight different industries in Austria by means of expert interviews. Results show, that IoT is only applied in a very limited way. Still, practitioners agree that it offers huge potential, e.g., to increase supply chain transparency, improve planning in SCM or provide real-time information as basis for risk handling. The main benefits of IoT are seen in form of improved process quality, higher level of customer satisfaction due to tracking and tracing, provision of additional real time data, and the creation of digital supply chain twins. Each analyzed company plans to implement IoT in SCM in the future. The paper provides several starting points for practitioners aiming to implement IoT in SCM. Our results also provide several opportunities for future research, e.g., to compare our findings for Austria with findings from other countries with especial focus on SMEs.},

We examined a technology that enables requesting and acquiring data among organizations by modeling the manufacturing process and providing models to other organizations. By specifying the range of data that can be provided to the outside for the created data model at the manufacturing site, it enables sharing the necessary and sufficient data with other organization and to keep the data confidential. We evaluated the proposed technology from the viewpoint of storage capacity. The data sharing method has two management type, centralized management and distributed management. As a result of examining for the feasibility of the proposed distributed management technology, the required maximum storage capacity is 128.6 GB per each organization' data management system. Therefore, we got a certain outlook that distributed management technology is feasible.},

abstract = {Smart ear-worn devices (called earables) are being equipped with various onboard sensors and algorithms, transforming earphones from simple audio transducers to multi-modal interfaces making rich inferences about human motion and vital signals. However, developing sensory applications using earables is currently quite cumbersome with several barriers in the way. First, time-series data from earable sensors incorporate information about physical phenomena in complex settings, requiring machine-learning (ML) models learned from large-scale labeled data. This is challenging in the context of earables because large-scale open-source datasets are missing. Secondly, the small size and compute constraints of earable devices make on-device integration of many existing algorithms for tasks such as human activity and head-pose estimation difficult. To address these challenges, we introduce Auritus, an extendable and open-source optimization toolkit designed to enhance and replicate earable applications. Auritus serves two primary functions. Firstly, Auritus handles data collection, pre-processing, and labeling tasks for creating customized earable datasets using graphical tools. The system includes an open-source dataset with 2.43 million inertial samples related to head and full-body movements, consisting of 34 head poses and 9 activities from 45 volunteers. Secondly, Auritus provides a tightly-integrated hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) optimizer and TinyML interface to develop lightweight and real-time machine-learning (ML) models for activity detection and filters for head-pose tracking. To validate the utlity of Auritus, we showcase three sample applications, namely fall detection, spatial audio rendering, and augmented reality (AR) interfacing. Auritus recognizes activities with 91% leave 1-out test accuracy (98% test accuracy) using real-time models as small as 6-13 kB. Our models are 98-740x smaller and 3-6% more accurate over the state-of-the-art. We also estimate head pose with absolute errors as low as 5 degrees using 20kB filters, achieving up to 1.6x precision improvement over existing techniques. We make the entire system open-source so that researchers and developers can contribute to any layer of the system or rapidly prototype their applications using our dataset and algorithms.},

However, it is still unclear how live data transmitted by connected devices informs the design of these products, going beyond performance optimisation to support creative practices. Design can be enriched by data captured by connected devices, from usage logs to environmental sensors, and data about the devices and people around them. Through a series of workshops, this paper contributes industry and academia perspectives on the future of data-driven product design. We highlight HCI challenges, issues and implications, including sensemaking and the generation of design insight. We further challenge current notions of data-driven design and envision ways in which future HCI research can develop ways to work with data in the design process in a connected, rich, human manner.},

A bi-manual musculoskeletal computational model of human upper-limb was overlayed onto the skeletal data to derive upper-limb muscle forces/energy spent during the aircraft maintenance tasks. The experiments were conducted with and without the use of MR devices, while CV based ML was applied to detect the energy used of aircraft maintainers in real-time while they performed tasks on an MRH90 helicopter. An analysis of augmented experience has been presented, which will act as a driver for the use of MR based applications in aircraft maintenance as well as battle-ready platforms. Preliminary results are encouraging and we envisage to use the proposed methodology for an objective assessment and detection of physical workload.},

abstract = {Presently, metaverse technology as a three-dimensional virtual world has many benefits, especially in promoting collaboration and trusting relationships between partners. Therefore, it hints at the potential application in supply chain resilience. Given the outbreak of COVID-19, face-to-face communication has been very difficult to achieve, and opportunistic behaviour, fake information, etc., lead to a lack of transparency in the supply chain. These factors have resulted in the destruction of collaboration between supply chain partners, making it difficult to build a resilient supply chain. In this context, the metaverse provides an effective solution in fostering collaboration based on trust between partners, further promoting supply chain resilience. However, there is still a lack of evidence explaining why the metaverse has positive efficiency in this respect. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap. A systematic literature review was conducted, and 18 relevant papers were analysed. We have identified the technology trends in virtual environments. Collaboration based on trust can be achieved in the metaverse. We also find key factors when the metaverse facilitates collaboration based on trust among supply chain partners to improve supply chain resilience, i.e., the role of sensory feedback. This paper is the first attempt to apply metadata in supply chain resilience. At the same time, it provides new solutions for managers in applying technologies to improve supply chain resilience. The main research limitation is the lack of an empirical analysis of the relationship among the metaverse, supply chain resilience, and sensory feedback. Research efforts should be geared towards developing a theoretical model for this relationship based on empirical analysis.},

abstract = {Vehicular Metaverses are widely considered as the next Internet revolution to build a 3D virtual world with immersive virtual-real interaction for passengers and drivers. In vehicular Metaverse applications, avatars are digital representations of on-board users to obtain and manage immersive vehicular services (i.e., avatar tasks) in Metaverses and the data they generate. However, traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data management solutions have serious data security risks and privacy protection. Fortunately, blockchain-based Web 3.0 enables avatars to have an ownership identity to securely manage the data owned by users in a decentralized and transparent manner. To ensure users’ immersive experiences and securely manage their data, avatar tasks often require significant computing resources. Therefore, it is impractical for the vehicles to process avatar tasks locally, massive computation resources are needed to support the avatar tasks. To this end, offloading avatar tasks to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs) is a promising solution to avoid computation overload. To ensure real-time and continuous Metaverse services, the avatar tasks should be migrated among the RSUs when the vehicle navigation. It is challenging for the vehicles to independently decide whether migrate or not according to current and future avatar states. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new avatar task migration framework for vehicular Metaverses. We then formulate the avatar task migration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and apply a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm to dynamically make migration decisions for avatar tasks. Numerous results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines for avatar task migration and enables immersive vehicular Metaverse services.},

Preventing unexpected or undesired ITSys| Envs behaviour is crucial not only to maximize customer value and satisfaction but also to fulfill strict service-level agreements. Given the constant need for operational changes in today’s dynamic IT-Sys|Envs as a response to evolving user requirements and expectations, DevOps teams face several challenges and uncertainties to limit the potential introduction of faults, foresee their occurrence, and comprehend their associated risks. While the accomplishments attained in the application of artificial intelligence to the operation of IT-Sys|Envs (i.e., AIOps) show promise, further research is necessary to facilitate the transition from reactive AIOps to its anticipated proactive, and risk-focused, manifestation. This involves advancing AIOps conceptualization and tooling for enabling improved software fault prognosis and remediation, augmented risk management, and enhanced explainability. We describe our vision for proactive AIOps and report our progress toward its viable realization through the application of relevant notions from the revolutionary concept of Digital Twins. Moreover, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding this promising integration and its impact on the future of software development and operation life cycles.},

abstract = {An emergency like COVID-19 requires a theoretical framework for policy implementation that involves public and private sector collaborations. After policy failures, new institutions have formed that trigger PPP's later, allowing the incumbent administration to continue in office longer. It focuses on novel approaches to dealing with pandemics. The present administration put these rules in place to keep COVID-19 under control. When it comes to Real Time - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, South Korea's government and corporations partnered to swiftly raise the quantity of testing in the country. Models of policy change are shown to be dynamic, cyclical, and recursive. During the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, an empirical content research was conducted. Even though South Korea's leader was at risk of losing public support to the point where impeachment was mentioned as a possible option, he dramatically reversed public mood to win general elections by a wide margin in April 2020, while the pandemic scenario persisted. To win reelection, democratic administrations are under more pressure to effectively perform crisis management when faced with a crisis. As a result, they are under even more pressure to immediately mobilize public and private resources. The emergency use authorization (EUA) protocol for test kits is an example of "leapfrogging actors" – up-and-coming innovators – who helped turn a pandemic tragedy into a possibility for sustained leadership and for them.

In this regard, the team of authors proposed an improved organizational and economic mechanism for creating a digital environment in the energy sector. It is concluded that the existing mechanisms for the transfer of information (digitalization) of asset classes of an energy enterprise do not correspond to the growth of involvement in the digital economy. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the development of an approach to the modernization of generating equipment, taking into account the current trend of digitalization of the electric power industry, which will increase the economic efficiency of CHP and its investment attractiveness. A distinctive feature of the proposed event is the analysis of digitalization indicators, which make it possible to assess the degree and readiness for digitalization of the station. The proposed mechanism has been tested on the example of a thermal power plant in the Moscow region.},

Despite the potential of simulation technology, there are several distinct challenges arising when simulating CPS, which mostly stem from their heterogeneity. In this paper, we present an approach to modeling and simulation of CPS that embraces this heterogeneity by integrating component models realized in domain-specific simulation tools in a co-simulation framework using a flexible plugin system. The framework includes an active simulation database that is used for modeling and communication, and a DE scheduler to orchestrate the co-simulation scenario. The approach is applied to a modular spacecraft where computational hardware is emulated and computer networks are simulated. This results in a comprehensive simulation of both physical and information processing systems.},

abstract = {Abstract: Because of the poor effect of traditional small target detection, by analyzing the characteristics of small targets, taking RESNET of deep separable convolution as the feature extraction network, a small target detection algorithm based on RESNET of deep separable convolution is proposed. In order to ensure that the network has good adaptability and strong small target feature extraction ability, the algorithm adopts the topology of the multi convolution kernel. The convolution form of the network is improved by packet convolution to reduce the number of network parameters and computation, and the improved channel shuffling is used to enhance the exchange of feature information between different packets and splice the output features. Finally, combined with the residual connection form, a deep separable packet convolution RESNET network (mower) with multiple convolution cores is formed. The experimental results of the DOTA data set show that the Top1 error rate and top5 error rate of the RESNET network based on deep separable convolution are 30.68% and 8.75%, respectively, which is 3.34% and 1.56% lower than that of traditional RESNET network. The complexity of the model is also reduced, which has obvious advantages over other network models.},

Among the vast amount of MBD research results, despite the bibliometric analysis, it does not provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge trends and developments in MBD research due to the small amount of data and poor timeliness. Therefore, based on the 3353 publications retrieved from Web of Science between 2002 and 2022, this paper performed quantitative, various kinds of cooperative networks, clustering networks, keywords, frontier trends and main path analysis. The conclusions are as follows. (1) MBD research findings are increasing at an even higher rate. (2) Research contribution differs widely between countries and institutions, and is relatively average between authors and journals. (3) MBD research frontiers show a tendency to span a wide range of disciplines and to be strongly associated with Internet technologies. (4) According to the results of the main path analysis, health IoT and medical big data are the hot spots for MBD research.},

abstract = {The continuous growth of airport operations generates continuous infrastructure expansion needs at international airports. In some cases, in the face of limitations in short-term expansions, the immediate solution is the creation of remote positions that allow a greater number of flights to be attended but which require the use of bus fleets to attend passenger boarding and disembarking operations. The sizing of the buses will allow to reduce the waiting times of flights below the level of service required by international standards. For this purpose, the development of a discrete event simulation model integrated to the transactional flight database is proposed. In the literature, although many references to simulation models have been found in airports, they have not been specifically focused in order to size and manage the bus fleet. Simulation experiments of this model under the management of scenarios allows to identify the bus fleet size required.},

Environmental protection is also one of the major challenges facing the world. How to use artificial intelligence technology to solve environmental problems has become a topic of great concern. Method: Using the low-carbon city pilot policy as a quasi natural experiment, the panel data of the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2015 to 2022 was analyzed using artificial intelligence, big data algorithms, and dual difference models, this paper empirically evaluates the pollution reduction effect of industrial pollution emission level. Results: The empirical results indicate that low-carbon pilot cities have significantly reduced wastewater emissions and per capita wastewater emissions; the promotion effect of low-carbon pilot city construction on carbon emission performance is sustained and continuously enhanced over time; and most of the leading low-carbon cities which have entered the post industrialization stage have less resistance to policy implementation and greater pollution reduction effect. Based on the above results, policy recommendations are put forward in this paper. Conclusion: The first is to expand the pilot scope of low-carbon cities and build a sustainable energy ecosystem. The second is to comprehensively deepen the concept of low-carbon development and pay attention to the control of wastewater and other pollution emissions. And the third is to scientifically design the combination of policy tools according to local conditions.},

Since the first paper, we have tested the algorithms on new datasets to investigate transferability from one background radiation environment to another. We have also performed a new hyperparameter optimization experiment with this new dataset to investigate the impact of new radiation data formatting techniques, the inclusion or neuronal temporality, and neuron charge leakage. This paper provides an overview and discussion of the results from this study. Of note, we report that the inclusion of neuronal temporality, or the process of maintaining synaptic state between sequences of input, improves recall by over 50% at an operationally-relevant false alarm rate of 1 hr-1.},

abstract = {In the recent revival of human labour in industry, and the subsequent push to optimally combine the strengths of man and machine in industrial processes, there is an increased need for methods allowing machines to understand and interpret the actions of their users. An important aspect of this is the understanding and evaluation of the progress of the workflows that are to be executed. Methods for this require both an appropriate choice of sensors, as well as algorithms capable of quickly and efficiently evaluating activity and workflow progress.In this paper we present such an algorithm, which provides activity and workflow recognition using both depth and RGB cameras as input. The algorithm's main purpose is to be used in an industrial training station, allowing novice workers to learn the necessary steps in assembling nordic ski products without the need for human supervision. We will describe how the algorithm recognizes predefined workflows in the sensor data, and present a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance on a real data recording of operators performing their work in an industrial setting. We will show that the algorithm fulfills the necessary requirements and is ready to be implemented in the training station application.},

abstract = {When developing autonomous systems, engineers and other stakeholders make great efforts to prepare the system for all foreseeable circumstances. However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.},

However, not much is yet known about the views and expectations of disabled students in this regard. The fact that the metaverse is still in its nascent stage exemplifies the need for such timely discourse. To bridge this important gap, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 56 university students with disabilities in the United States and Hong Kong to understand their views and expectations concerning the future of metaverse-driven education. We have distilled student expectations into five thematic categories, referred to as the REEPS framework: Recognition, Empowerment, Engagement, Privacy, and Safety. Additionally, we have summarized the main design considerations in eight concise points. This paper is aimed at helping technology developers and policymakers plan ahead of time and improving the experiences of students with disabilities.},

abstract = {The dynamic forces that transit back and forth traditional boundaries of system development have led to the emergence of digital ecosystems. Within these, business gains are achieved through the development of intelligent control that requires a continuous design and runtime co-engineering process endangered by malicious attacks. The possibility of inserting specially crafted faults capable to exploit the nature of unknown evolving intelligent behavior raises the necessity of malicious behavior detection at runtime.Adjusting to the needs and opportunities of fast AI development within digital ecosystems, in this paper, we envision a novel method and framework for runtime predictive evaluation of intelligent robots' behavior for assuring a cooperative safe adjustment.},

abstract = {Systems engineering is a bit different from other engineering disciplines in that students from many disciplines are enrolled in the program. Therefore, the objective is not to teach a simulation subject in depth, but rather to introduce the students to different techniques so that they can work with and manage simulation staff on a project. However, they need some "hands on" experience so that they know how challenging simulations can be, avoiding the trap of underestimating the effort involved. This paper describes the approach used at Georgia Tech to teach a compressed 7 week simulation survey course called ASE 6003 Modeling &amp; Simulation in Systems Engineering. We describe the techniques used, our approach and the results achieved over recent years of teaching simulation in this format. Finally we discuss lessons learned and offer suggestions for others interested in offering a similar course.},

These systems depend on the correct operation of sensors, actuators, and third-party services, and the failure of a single one can hinder the proper functioning of the whole system, making error detection and recovery of paramount importance, but often overlooked. By drawing inspiration from other research areas, such as cloud, embedded, and mission-critical systems, we present a set of patterns for self-healing IoT systems.

abstract = {Visual recognition of the content and actions that take place in a construction site is important in many applications such as data-driven simulation, autonomous systems, and intelligent machinery. Construction project, however, are dynamic and complex, and often take place in harsh environments. This may hinder the ability to collect good quality, well-lit, and occlusion-free imagery, which in turn, can lower the performance of computer vision models for fast and reliable object detection. In this paper, we propose and validate a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based generative adversarial network (GAN) trained and tested on construction site photos from two in-house datasets to increase image resolution by generating missing pixel information. Results show that using GAN-enhanced images can improve the average precision of pre-trained models for detecting objects such as building, equipment, worker, hard hat, and safety vest by up to 32% while maintaining the overall processing time for real-time object detection.},

Although generalizable results contributed to increase the maturity of the field, it is also paramount to address the ecological validity of evaluations outside the laboratory. Despite real-world scenarios being clearly challenging, successful in-situ and remote deployment has become realistic to address a broad variety of research questions, thus, expanding participants’ sample to more specific target users, considering multi-modal constraints not reflected in controlled laboratory settings and other benefits. In this paper, a set of multimodal XR experiments conducted outside the laboratory are described (e.g., industrial field studies, remote collaborative tasks, longitudinal rehabilitation exercises). Then, a list of lessons learned is reported, illustrating challenges, and opportunities, aiming to increase the level of awareness of the research community and facilitate performing further evaluations.},

Especially when systems are safety-critical and demand reliability, new methods and tools are thus essential to support the reusability aspect in the development process. A model-based approach, in conjunction, moreover helps to communicate between different stakeholders, provides different views and serves as a central storage of information. Through applying reliability analysis and simulation-based verification methods on our hardware model and furthermore automatic generation of a first virtual prototype, we are able to reduce the tools involved, thus resulting in correctness, completeness and consistency of the entire system.},

abstract = {As Cyber Physical-Internet of Things Systems (CPS-IoT Systems) continue to advance, we have noticed an expansion of the variety of entity types deployed in these systems. With this expansion, the complexity of handling vastly different communication protocols, processes, and data within the system in a timely manner has become a significant challenge. One potential method of quickly processing this data is to push essential computation concerning the Transitional State Change (TSC) feedback loop from the cloud to the edge of the system. In this paper, we propose DRAEC, a novel edge computing framework that uses agent-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Complex-Event Processing (CEP) to significantly decrease the latency of the TSC feedback loop and subsequently increase the system’s scalability. This increase in performance is achieved by using a CEP system to synthesize discreet events from CPS-IoT entity telemetry, which our novel Dynamic Reactive Agent then uses to quickly generate and enforce controls on a user’s physical environment via a user-defined operational policy. We then present supporting results, showing that our novel edge computing framework enables a CPS-IoT control system to outperform a cloud-centric variant by 20-43x (depending on the connection type) when comparing the latency of the TSC feedback loop; it also enables support of significantly larger scale (10-100x) systems while maintaining the same level of service as the cloud-centric version.},

Increased connectivity, however, may increase the attack surface of a municipality's critical functions. Increased supply chain attacks (up nearly 80 % in 2019) and municipal ransomware attacks (up 60 % in 2019) motivate the need for holistic approaches to risk assessment. Therefore, we present a methodology to quantify the degree to which supply-chain movements may be observed or disrupted via compromised smart-city devices. Our data-processing pipeline uses publicly available datasets to model intermodal commodity flows within and surrounding a municipality. Using a hierarchy tree to adaptively sample spatial networks within geographic regions of interest, we bridge the gap between grid- and network-based risk assessment frameworks. Results based on fieldwork for the Jack Voltaic exercises sponsored by the Army Cyber Institute demonstrate our approach on intermodal movements through Charleston, SC and San Diego, CA.},

However, ecological and economic demands also require a cross-domain linkage of multiple scientific perspectives from material sciences, engineering, operations, business, and ergonomics, as optimization opportunities can be derived from any of these perspectives. To extend the IIoT to a true Internet of Production, two concepts are required: first, a complex, interrelated network of Digital Shadows which combine domain-specific models with data-driven AI methods; and second, the integration of a large number of research labs, engineering, and production sites as a World Wide Lab which offers controlled exchange of selected, innovation-relevant data even across company boundaries. In this article, we define the underlying Computer Science challenges implied by these novel concepts in four layers: Smart human interfaces provide access to information that has been generated by model-integrated AI. Given the large variety of manufacturing data, new data modeling techniques should enable efficient management of Digital Shadows, which is supported by an interconnected infrastructure. Based on a detailed analysis of these challenges, we derive a systematized research roadmap to make the vision of the Internet of Production a reality.},

abstract = {Wearable devices have become indispensable gadgets in people’s daily lives nowadays; especially wireless earphones have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, which lead to increasing interest and explorations of user authentication techniques. Conventional user authentication methods embedded in wireless earphones that use microphones or other modalities are vulnerable to environmental factors, such as loud noises or occlusions. To address this limitation, we introduce EarPPG, a new biometric modality that takes advantage of the unique in-ear photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, altered by a user’s unique speaking behaviors. When the user is speaking, muscle movements cause changes in the blood vessel geometry, inducing unique PPG signal variations. As speaking behaviors and PPG signals are unique, the EarPPG combines both biometric traits and presents a secure and obscure authentication solution. The system first detects and segments EarPPG signals and proceeds to extract effective features to construct a user authentication model with the 1D ReGRU network. We conducted comprehensive real-world evaluations with 25 human participants and achieved 94.84% accuracy, 0.95 precision, recall, and f1-score, respectively. Moreover, considering the practical implications, we conducted several extensive in-the-wild experiments, including body motions, occlusions, lighting, and permanence. Overall outcomes of this study possess the potential to be embedded in future smart earable devices.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very powerful technology and can be a potential disrupter and essential enabler. As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, etc. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including 1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; 2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and 3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.},

The modeling notations employed to design, verify, and operate such systems have increasingly started to capture different types of uncertainty, so that they can be explicitly considered when systems are developed and deployed. While these modeling paradigms consider different sources of uncertainty individually, these sources are rarely independent, and their interactions affect the achievement of system goals in subtle and often unpredictable ways. This vision paper describes the problem of uncertainty interaction in software-intensive systems, illustrating it on examples from relevant application domains. We then identify key open challenges and define desiderata that future modeling notations and model-driven engineering research should consider to address these challenges.},

abstract = {The energy consumption of electric vehicles (EVs) depends on multiple factors. As it affects vehicle range, energy consumption must be accurately predicted. After a summary of the relevant literature, this paper focuses on two sensitivity studies: one on the impact of wind on energy consumption, and the other on the identifiability of wind in the absence of vehicles’ speed and acceleration profiles. The studies show that wind has a significant impact on the energy consumption for a trip, and without high-resolution knowledge of the acceleration and instantaneous velocity, minor variations in the wind condition do not drastically alter the energy consumption distribution. After that, data sources for the information on the wind velocity and direction are discussed. A data-driven approach based on fuzzy set theory is proposed to incorporate wind into the energy prediction; the best model from this approach shows a notable improvement (3.62%) over the currently implemented production-level predictive model for energy consumption on a data set of 35,139 real-world trips; the improvement is even more pronounced (∼ 7%) for trips with more substantial headwind or tailwind level. Recognizing the interplay between range prediction and route selection, we consider a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for battery-charge- and travel-time-aware optimal route planning that accounts for the impact of the wind and includes stops at the charging stations. Finally, we propose a framework that includes wind in the operation of EVs, which consists of learning the impact of wind, incorporating wind forecasting into range and energy prediction, and using that prediction to perform optimal routing.},

abstract = {The distributed Cloud Computing paradigm is continuously being adopted within the industrial automation domain. The most distinguishing feature of these Edge Clouds relates to their ability to provide low-latency and even hard realtime services. As infrastructure deployments can be rather heterogeneous in their nature, service providers require precise means for estimating end-to-end application latency behavior, in order to know performance boundaries that can be met for defining certain Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Although network performance tools exist for many years, mechanisms for assessing hard real-time performance of applications in distributed Edge Cloud environments have not been considered extensively yet. Therefore, we use a built-in feature of the Linux Kernel, the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), to measure delays between targeted endpoints in the kernel stack, that enable the user to gain deeper and more accurate measurements of events as compared to generalized approaches (as accurate as eBPF / the time-stamping facility from the kernel). As a result, the real-time behavior of particular Edge Cloud deployments, including its hosted applications, can be profiled in detail by end-users as well as service-providers. Within our evaluation we have monitored a cyclic transmission of packets with a scheduled delay of under 190 μs and measured a round trip time under 2 ms. Future work include profiling the real-time behavior of potentially hosted time-critical applications, such as virtual Programmable Logic Controllers (vPLCs), over real-time networks, such Time Sensitive Networking (TSN); the extension towards dynamically configured real-time networks; and finally its application to future organic, self-optimizing Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication 6G core networks.},

These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.},

While the existing surveys have reviewed the sensor-cloud from various perspectives, they are inadequate for the three key issues that require urgent attention in the sensor-cloud: reliability, energy, and heterogeneity. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by examining the origins of the sensor-cloud and providing an in-depth and comprehensive discussion of these three key challenges. We summarize initial designs of the new edge-based schemes to address these challenges and identify several open issues and promising future research directions.},

abstract = {The metaverse, as an emerging technical term, conceptually aims to construct a virtual digital space that runs parallel to the physical world. Due to humans behaviors and interactions are represented in the virtual world, security in metaverse is a challenging issue in which traditional centralized service model is one of the threat sources. In order to conquer the obstacle caused by centralized computing, blockchain-based solutions are potential problem-solving methods. However, it is difficult for a single blockchain to support large-scale data and business services in the metaverse, due to the scalability restrictions. Moreover, multi-chain settings also encounter the interoperability issues. In this work, we propose a Relay chain and Asynchronous consensus-based Consortium blockchain cross-Chain (RAC-Chain) model, which realizes message transmission and cross-chain transactions in multiple chains by adopting the relay chain and cross-chain gateways. All nodes of the application chains and the relay chain execute cross-chain transactions in sequence and reach a consensus on transactions at any transmission delay. Our experiment evaluations demonstrate that our approach performs well in atomicity, security, and functionality (cross-chain transactions), such that the performance of blockchain scalability in metaverse can be improved, comparing with the traditional relay chain schemes.},

Results show that more than 60% of the reported usability problems were shared by both the physical and virtual prototype, and the in-depth qualitative analysis further highlights the potential of immersive VR evaluations.

abstract = {Robust and accurate camera pose estimation is fundamental in computer vision. Learning-based regression approaches acquire six-degree-of-freedom camera parameters accurately from visual cues of an input image. However, most are trained on street-view and landmark datasets. These approaches can hardly be generalized to overlooking use cases, such as the calibration of the surveillance camera and unmanned aerial vehicle. Besides, reference images captured from the real world are rare and expensive, and their diversity is not guaranteed. In this article, we address the problem of using alternative virtual images for visual localization training. This work has the following principle contributions: First, we present a new challenging localization dataset containing six reconstructed large-scale three-dimensional scenes, 10,594 calibrated photographs with condition changes, and 300k virtual images with pixelwise labeled depth, relative surface normal, and semantic segmentation. Second, we present a flexible multi-feature fusion network trained on virtual image datasets for robust image retrieval. Third, we propose an end-to-end confidence map prediction network for feature filtering and pose estimation. We demonstrate that large-scale rendered virtual images are beneficial to visual localization. Using virtual images can solve the diversity problem of real images and leverage labeled multi-feature data for deep learning. Experimental results show that our method achieves remarkable performance surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. To foster research on improvement for visual localization using synthetic images, we release our benchmark at .},

abstract = {Studies point that smartphones show an important role in the improvement of museum visitors experience. Mobile devices have become the main tool available for travellers, which enables the diffusion of augmented reality solutions through this channel. Based on that, a virtual guide prototype was developed to enhance the museum visitors experience inside a famous attraction from Foz do Iguaçu, the Ecomuseu, constructed with the objective to show the work of Itaipu’s hydroelectric power plant and the history regarding the region occupied by its reservoir. The developed application inserts virtual elements in different locations of the museum. Whenever such elements are “captured”, they tell the visitor information about what is being exhibited so the perception of the visitor and knowledge absorption can be improved. To validate the proposed solution, we tested the app with 15 different users. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted the app and performed the evaluation over the virtual tour of the same museum, which is available online. For the sake of our knowledge, this is the first time an augmented reality application is evaluated over a virtual representation of a museum. Despite the difficulties imposed by the current context, the feedback from the tested users was very positive.},

abstract = {The Ubiquitous Operating System(UOS) is a new type of operating system in response to the new patterns and scenarios of future human-cyber-physical ternary ubiquitous computing. Compared with traditional operating systems, one of the fundamental requirements of UOS is to adaptively manage numerous heterogeneous sensors according to dynamic environments and diverse tasks. However, traditional management focuses on the sensors’ parameters and interfaces without highlighting the perception effect that is users’ concern and dynamic changing. It also lacks a unified management approach for heterogeneous sensors. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel heterogeneous sensors dynamic management model UbiCap, i.e., Ubiquitous Capability, which is based on the capability abstraction and adaptive run-time capability management mechanism. The capability provides a unified abstract for heterogeneous sensors. The adaptive run-time capability management mechanism transfers the management object from low-level hardware sensors to high-level sensing capability. The capability required and the available capability are matched to support run-time adaptive sensors selection. We implement a software prototype iS2ROS(intelligent Sensor Selection Robot Operating System) based on the UbiCap model. We then simulate a forest fire spot monitoring scenario where iS2ROS selects the optimal image sensor during the identification task execution while light or weather condition changes. Experiment results show that the iS2ROS achieves comparative sensing effectiveness through UbiCap with 50% power consumption lower compared to the traditional both-sensors approach.},

abstract = {Discrete manufacturing systems are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) and their availability, performance, and quality have a big impact on the economy. Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. In this paper, we present SDCWorks---a modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It consists of the semantic structures for creating models, a baseline controller, and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator for SDCWorks models. We provide the semantics of such a manufacturing system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, and monitoring. We illustrate the expressive power of SDCWorks by modeling the realistic SMART manufacturing testbed of University of Michigan. We show how our open source SDCWorks simulator can be used to evaluate relevant metrics (throughput, latency, and load) for example manufacturing systems.},

abstract = {Digital preservation of Cultural Heritage (CH) sites is crucial to protect them against damage from natural disasters or human activities. Creating 3D models of CH sites has become a popular method of digital preservation thanks to advancements in computer vision and photogrammetry. However, the process is time-consuming, expensive, and typically requires specialized equipment and expertise, posing challenges in resource-limited developing countries. Additionally, the lack of an open repository for 3D models hinders research and public engagement with their heritage. To address these issues, we propose Tirtha, a web platform for crowdsourcing images of CH sites and creating their 3D models. Tirtha utilizes state-of-the-art Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques. It is modular, extensible and cost-effective, allowing for the incorporation of new techniques as photogrammetry advances. Tirtha is accessible through a web interface at https://tirtha.niser.ac.in and can be deployed on-premise or in a cloud environment. In our case studies, we demonstrate the pipeline’s effectiveness by creating 3D models of temples in Odisha, India, using crowdsourced images. These models are available for viewing, interaction, and download on the Tirtha website. Our work aims to provide a dataset of crowdsourced images and 3D reconstructions for research in computer vision, heritage conservation, and related domains. Overall, Tirtha is a step towards democratizing digital preservation, primarily in resource-limited developing countries.},

abstract = {Industrial Automation and Control systems have matured into a stable infrastructure model that has been kept fundamentally unchanged, using discrete embedded systems (such as Programmable Logic Controllers) to implement the first line of sensorization, actuation, and process control and stations and servers providing monitoring, supervision, logging/database and data-sharing capabilities, among others. More recently, with the emergence of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and the need for more flexibility, there has been a steady trend towards virtualizing some of the automation station/server components, first by using virtual machines and, more recently, by using container technology. This trend is pushing for better support for real-time requirements on enabling virtualization technologies such as virtual machines and containers. This article provides a systematic review on the use of container virtualization in real-time environments such as cyber-physical systems, assessing how existing and emerging technologies can fulfill the associated requirements. Starting by reviewing fundamental concepts related to container technology and real-time requirements, it goes on to present the methodology and results of a systematic study of 37 selected papers covering aspects related to the enforcement of real-time constrains within container hosts and the expected task latency on such environments, as well as an overview of container platforms and orchestration mechanisms for RT systems.},

It explains the development status in all aspects of smart manufacturing, via the example of ceramic circuit board manufacturing and electronic assembly, and outlines future smart manufacturing plans and processes. The research proposed two experiments using artificial intelligence and deep learning to demonstrate the problems and solutions regarding methods in manufacturing and factory facilities, respectively. In the first experiment, a Bayesian network inference is used to find the cause of the problem of metal residues between electronic circuits through key process and quality correlations. In the second experiment, a convolutional neural network is used to identify false defects that were overinspected during automatic optical inspection. This improves the manufacturing process by enhancing the yield rate and reducing cost. The contributions of the study built in circuit board production. Smart manufacturing, with the application of a Bayesian network to an Internet of Things setup, has addressed the problem of residue and redundant conductors on the edge of the ceramic circuit board pattern, and has improved and prevented leakage and high-frequency interference. The convolutional neural network and deep learning were used to improve the accuracy of the automatic optical inspection system, reduce the current manual review ratio, save labor costs, and provide defect classification as a reference for preprocess improvement.},

abstract = {In the era of the Web of Things, the Metaverse is expected to be the landing site for the next generation of the Internet, resulting in the increased popularity of related technologies and applications in recent years and gradually becoming the focus of Internet research. The Metaverse, as a link between the real and virtual worlds, can provide users with immersive experiences. As the concept of the Metaverse grows in popularity, many scholars and developers begin to focus on the Metaverse’s ethics and core. This paper argues that the Metaverse should be centered on humans. That is, humans constitute the majority of the Metaverse. As a result, we begin this paper by introducing the Metaverse’s origins, characteristics, related technologies, and the concept of the human-centric Metaverse (HCM). Second, we discuss the manifestation of human-centric in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss some current issues in the construction of HCM. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the applications of human-centric technologies in the Metaverse, as well as the relevant HCM application scenarios. We hope that this paper can provide researchers and developers with some directions and ideas for human-centric Metaverse construction.},

abstract = {The physical world we live in is accelerating digitalization with the vigorous development of Internet of Things (IoT). Following this trend, Web of Things (WoT) further enables fast and efficient creation of various applications that perceive and act on the physical world using standard Web technologies. A popular way for creating WoT applications is Trigger-Action Programming (TAP), which allows users to orchestrate the capabilities of IoT devices in the form of “if trigger, then action”. However, existing TAP approaches don’t support scenario-centric WoT applications which involve abstract modeling of physical environments and complex spatio-temporal dependencies between events and actions. In this paper, we propose an approach called SCTAP&nbsp;which supports Scenario-Centric Trigger-Action Programming based on software-defined physical environments. SCTAP&nbsp;defines a structured and conceptual representation for physical environments, which provides the required programming abstractions for WoT applications. Based on the representation, SCTAP&nbsp;defines a grammar for specifying scenario-centric WoT applications with spatio-temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we design a service-based architecture for SCTAP&nbsp;which supports the integration of device access, event perception, environment representation, and rule execution in a loosely-coupled and extensible way. We implement SCTAP&nbsp;as a WoT infrastructure and evaluate it with two case studies including a smart laboratory and a smart coffee house. The results confirm the usability, feasibility and efficiency of SCTAP&nbsp;and its implementation.},

abstract = {A systems-of-systems (SoS) is a class of systems characterized by the collaboration among independent constituent systems, each one with its own purposes and functionalities and interacting with the others aiming to meet common global missions. An essential characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further work on the topic.},

However, a key challenge for the deployment and use of these systems is the interrelated factor of ensuring technical, human and societal trust. To help address this complex issue, we first turn our attention to research on the technical properties of swarms, such as proficiency, scalability, robustness, and adaptability and their role in building trust. Second, we explore the area of research known as Human-Swarm Interaction, which studies how humans understand, monitor, control, and interact with swarms. Third, we focus on techniques used to specify, verify and validate swarms. Finally, we discuss the future of swarm robotics and conclude by suggesting areas of advancement which may help build human and society’s trust towards robot swarms.},

abstract = {Individuals often avoid intercultural interactions due to biases and stereotyped perceptions about others.&nbsp;However, these encounters are needed to promote social inclusion and diversity. Previous PD studies have supported migrants’ social inclusion through developing their social capital and empowerment. Very few studies explored the facilitation of intercultural interactions within everyday contexts, like public places; further, most studies provide western perspectives. Addressing this gap, we conducted a focus group study with migrants and locals living in Istanbul, a city connecting eastern and western cultures, to explore how they perceive intercultural meaningful social interactions (IMSI). We asked participants to share poems about meaningful interactions, opening a dialogue about their intercultural life experiences. This technique allowed us to identify abstract qualities of IMSI and factors that influence them. We contribute to PD work on social inclusion by presenting in-between perspectives of IMSI and discussing opportunities for facilitating IMSI in a super-diverse city.},

In discussion, we look to expand the concept of Fractured Objects by relating it to other design concepts such as Seamful Design and Wabi-Sabi, and explore the relationship to the temporality of interaction. We introduce Kintsugi VR with Fractured Objects, drawing on the concept of ‘golden repair’ in which the act of reconnecting fractured parts improves the resulting whole object.},

abstract = {Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not yet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the metaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures, and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in mind: (1) What is the framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse? and (2) What activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic system framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed economic system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance activities, and cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly discuss three questions: (a) the rationale of this topic, (b) why the metaverse needs this topic, and (c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the metaverse needs and the insights behind the economic activities in the metaverse.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz)-band communications have been envisioned as a key technology to support ultra-high-data-rate applications in 5G-beyond (or 6G) wireless networks. Compared to the microwave and mmWave bands, the main challenges with the THz band are in its i) large path loss hence limited network coverage and ii) visible-light-like propagation characteristics hence poor support of mobility in blockage-rich environments. This paper studies quantitatively the applicability of THz-band communications in blockage-rich mobile environments, focusing on a new network scenario called &lt;italic&gt;FlyTera&lt;/italic&gt;. In &lt;italic&gt;FlyTera&lt;/italic&gt;, a set of hotspots mounted on flying drones collaboratively provide data streaming services to ground users, in the microwave, mmWave and THz bands. We first provide a mathematical formulation of the &lt;italic&gt;FlyTera&lt;/italic&gt; control problem, where the objective is to maximize the network spectral efficiency by jointly controlling the flight of the drone hotspots, their association to the ground users, and the spectrum bands used by the users. To solve the resulting problem, which is shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear nonconvex programming (MINLP) problem, we design distributed solution algorithms based on a combination of echo state learning and reinforcement learning. An extensive simulation campaign is then conducted with SimBAG, a newly developed &lt;underline&gt;Sim&lt;/underline&gt;ulator of &lt;underline&gt;B&lt;/underline&gt;roadband &lt;underline&gt;A&lt;/underline&gt;erial-&lt;underline&gt;G&lt;/underline&gt;round wireless networks. It is shown that no single spectrum band can meet the requirements of high data rate and wide coverage simultaneously. Moreover, from the network-level point of view, THz-band communications can significantly benefit from the mobility of the flying drones, and on average &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$4 - 6$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; times &lt;italic&gt;higher (rather than lower)&lt;/italic&gt; throughput can be achieved in mobile than in static environments.},

abstract = {Smart devices have been widely adopted in our daily life. A smart home system, e.g., Home Assistant and openHAB, can be equipped with hundreds and even thousands of smart devices. A smart home system communicates with smart devices through various device integrations, each of which is responsible for a specific kind of devices. Developing high-quality device integrations is a challenging task, in which developers have to properly handle the heterogeneity of different devices, unexpected exceptions, etc. We find that device integration bugs, i.e., iBugs, are prevalent and have caused various consequences, e.g., causing devices unavailable, unexpected device behaviors. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study on 330 iBugs in Home Assistant, the most popular open source smart home system. We investigate their root causes, trigger conditions, impacts, and fixes. From our study, we obtain many interesting findings and lessons that are helpful for device integration developers and smart home system designers. Our study can open up new research directions for combating iBugs in smart home systems.},

By leveraging underlying market-clearing processes, we establish a closed-form relationship between the unknown parameters and the publicly available market-clearing results. Based on this relationship, we formulate the data-driven IO problem as a computationally feasible single-level optimization problem. The solution of the data-driven model is based on the gradient descent method, which provides an error bound on the optimal solution and a sub-linear convergence rate. We also rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of the global optimum to the proposed data-driven IO problem and analyze its robustness in two possible noisy settings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations in both an illustrative IEEE 14-bus system and a realistic NYISO 1814-bus system.},

abstract = {Social media platforms have made increasing use of irony in recent years. Users can express their ironic thoughts with audio, video, and images attached to text content. When you use irony, you are making fun of a situation or trying to make a point. It can also express frustration or highlight the absurdity of a situation. The use of irony in social media is likely to continue to increase, no matter the reason. By using syntactic information in conjunction with semantic exploration, we show that attention networks can be enhanced. Using learned embedding, unsupervised learning encodes word order into a joint space. By evaluating the entropy of an example class and adding instances, the active learning method uses the shared representation as a query to retrieve semantically similar sentences from a knowledge base. In this way, the algorithm can identify the instance with the maximum uncertainty and extract the most informative example from the training set. An ironic network trained for each labelled record is used to train a classifier (model). The partial training model and the original labelled data generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To correctly predict the label of a dataset, a classifier (attention network) updates the pseudo-labels for the remaining datasets. After the experimental evaluation of the 1,021 annotated texts, the proposed model performed better than the baseline models, achieving an F1 score of 0.63 on ironic tasks and 0.59 on non-ironic tasks. We also found that the proposed model generalized well to new instances of datasets.},

In 2017, the ITiCSE IoT working group identified relevant content, tools for teaching, and four IoT course types. The resulting report provided an entry point for educators challenged with setting up a new IoT course, but did not consider the curricular content of a standalone specialization nor effective teaching approaches for this interdisciplinary field. In this report, the 2018 working group builds on its prior work through an updated review of literature and interviews with IoT instructors. The report addresses two research questions. First, what should a curriculum intended to produce IoT specialists include? We propose here a transdisciplinary curriculum that integrates threads from several disciplines on a single campus and we relate it to the ACM/IEEE 2013 Computing Curricula Knowledge Areas. Second, what pedagogical practices should be used to teach IoT? We found very little scholarship describing actual teaching practices, but our interviewees described their approaches and challenges in teaching. We present these as well as descriptions of several relevant teaching approaches in the report.},

However, (trans)humanity and future cities are defined in a bi-directional dependency. Therefore, we have to answer the questions of future humans and cities simultaneously. This paper maps several ways of interacting between transhuman communities and smart cities to understand their possible effects on governing, design and society at large resulting in a framework that will work as a cautionary tale and an inspirational blueprint for imagining future urbanity.},

abstract = {Many facts change over time, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical environment. In the case of pandemic articles, the user is not interested in the creation date of the document, but in the facts and the cause of the last pandemic. Fake news can be better combated by having a document with a temporal focus. Currently, neither the sequence of events nor the temporal focus is considered when obtaining news documents. Despite the limited number of temporal aspects in the available datasets, it is difficult to test and evaluate the temporal conclusions of the model. The goal of this work is to develop a temporal focus news article retrieval model based on co-training to advance research in semi-supervised learning. A mapping of the dataset is performed using 1) the evolving focus time of news articles, 2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors for learning neural contrast embedding models generating focus time-based query in sequential news articles to facilitate temporal understanding by learning low-dimensional continuous vectors. A diverse dataset of news articles is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With semi-supervised learning and lexicon expansion, the result of the developed model can achieve 89%. The method performed better than previous baselines and traditional machine learning models with improvements of 12.65% and 4.7%, respectively.},

abstract = {In the information retrieval community, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) has become increasingly popular. Documents focused on the time surrounding their publication are more likely to be accurate and contain information relevant to the reader. In this study, we explore the inverted pyramid paradigm by extracting temporal expressions from news documents, standardizing their values, and evaluating them based on their position within the text. We present a lexicon expansion method that employs WordNet as input. This approach enhances the lexicon by grouping words with similar meanings, potentially improving the accuracy of event detection algorithms. Additionally, this process can introduce new words and phrases to the lexicon, expanding the vocabulary. Using each tagged dataset, a classifier is trained with a pre-trained network. A pool of unlabeled data are processed, and high-confidence pseudo-labels are assigned. Pseudo-labels are generated by leveraging the partially trained model and the original labelled data. As the classifier predicts the correct label for a data sample, the pseudo-labels of other data samples are updated, and vice versa. At the end of this process, the predictions from different matching classifiers are combined. It takes several rounds to label the unlabeled inputs using this method. To evaluate the proposed solutions, we conducted experiments on 4,500 online news articles relevant to temporal retrieval. LSTM, BiLSTM, and BERT models with and without lexicon expansion were assessed based on log loss and relative divergence of entropy. A jointly trained semi-supervised learning model achieved a mean KL divergence of 0.89, an F1 score of 0.74 for temporal events, and 0.63 for non-temporal events. Besides alleviating data sparsity issues and enabling the training of more complex networks, this technique can also serve as an alternative to data augmentation methods.},

abstract = {The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 × 200 × 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.},

abstract = {Virtual devices based on device emulation have been widely used in lab research of mobile app testing for their efficiency and low cost. However, it remains controversial to use virtual devices for app testing in industry, given the inherent difficulties of high-fidelity emulation across diverse mobile systems and devices. Hence, mobile app companies still rely on physical device farms or services like AWS Device Farm.This paper presents our effort to analyze, improve, and effectively use virtual devices for large-scale testing of mobile apps like Douyin. Our goal is to understand the fidelity of virtual devices and to explore how to better utilize virtual devices to improve the efficiency and accessibility of mobile app testing in industrial settings. Our study is conducted on a massive commercial testing infrastructure that deploys a physical device farm and its virtualized counterpart.We show that high-fidelity app testing can be achieved by sensible design and implementation of virtual device farms. With that, we find that major discrepancies are no longer caused by commonly believed factors like hardware heterogeneity and system customizations, but due to non-standard, uncoordinated, and occasionally defective vendor-specific services and drivers, as well as defense mechanisms against malicious app behavior. We present effective solutions to address those problems to significantly improve testing fidelity. We also share our experiences of using virtual device farms to substantially improve the efficiency and accessibility of mobile app testing, without compromising safety.},

abstract = {Driven by the core technologies, i.e., sensor-based autonomous data acquisition and the cloud-based big data analysis, IoT automates the actuation of data-driven intelligent actions on the connected objects. This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.},

abstract = {Tactile Internet based Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) are highly sensitive to component and communication latencies and packet drops. Building a high performing TCPS, thus, necessitates experimenting with different hardware, algorithms, access technologies, and communication protocols. To facilitate such experiments, we have developed TCPSbed, a modular testbed for TCPS. TCPSbed facilitates the integration of different components, both real and simulated, to realize different TCPS applications and evaluate their latency and control performances. TCPSbed&amp;#x2019;s latency analyzer tool employs a novel method to isolate latencies of individual TCPS components such as the latencies contributed by actuation, sensing, algorithms, and by the network, all in an online fashion. TCPSbed&amp;#x2019;s method of analyzing stability is also novel. It involves the use of the step response analysis method, a classic control-theoretic method used for analyzing the stability of generic control systems. TCPSbed&amp;#x2019;s support for edge intelligence modules enables prediction of command and feedback signals at the network&amp;#x2019;s edge allowing TCPS applications to perform well in adverse network conditions. TCPSbed&amp;#x2019;s source-code, made available through our GitHub page &lt;italic&gt;TactileInternet&lt;/italic&gt;, allows developers to extend its features and functionalities further. In this paper, we describe the architecture and implementation details of TCPSbed and demonstrate its features through several proof-of-concept experiments.},

abstract = {Developers have long recognized the importance of the concepts underlying the systems they build, and the primary role that concepts play in shaping user experience. To date, however, concepts have tended to be only implicit in software design with development being organized instead around more concrete artifacts (such as wireframes and code modules).  

Palantir, a software company whose data analytics products are widely used by major corporations, recently reworked the internal representation of its software development process to bring concepts to the fore, making explicit the concepts underlying its products, including how they are clustered together, used in applications, and governed by teams. With a centralized repository of concepts, Palantir engineers are able to align products more closely based on shared concepts, evolve concepts in response to user needs, and communicate more effectively with non-engineering groups within the company.  

This paper reports on Palantir's experiences to date, analyzing both successes and challenges, and offers advice to other organizations considering adopting a concept-centric approach to software development.},

abstract = {SysML models are widely used for designing and analyzing complex systems. Model-based design methods often require successive modifications of the models, whether for incrementally refining the design (e.g. in agile development methods) or for testing different design options. Such modifications, or mutations, are also used in mutation-based testing approaches. However, the definition of mutation operators can be a complex issue and applying them to models is sometimes performed by hand: this is time consuming and error prone. The paper addresses this issue thanks to the introduction of AMULET, the first mutation language for SysML. AMULET encompasses the modifications targeting SysML block and state-machine diagrams, and is supported by a compiler the paper presents. This compiler is integrated in TTool, an open-source SysML toolkit, enabling the full support of design methods including model design, mutation and verification tasks in a unique toolkit. The paper also introduces two case-studies providing concrete examples of AMULET use for modeling vulnerabilities and cyber attacks, and highlighting the benefits of AMULET for SysML mutations.},

To answer this, we propose a co-design study that reveals the important elements people value in their daily interactions with food. We then present a speculative catalogue of novel metaverse food experiences, and insights from discussing these ideas with food designers, anthropologists and metaverse experts.

Computing paradigms like Edge/Fog computing are able to provide the required flexibility and scalability while guaranteeing low latencies and response times. Orchestration systems play a key role in these environments, enforcing automatic management of resources and workloads’ lifecycle, and drastically reducing the need for manual interventions. However, they do not currently meet industrial non-functional requirements, such as real-timeliness, determinism, reliability, and support for mixed-criticality workloads.In this article, we present k4.0s, an orchestration system for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) environments, which enables the support for real-time and mixed-criticality workloads. We highlight through experiments the need for novel monitoring approaches and propose a workflow for selecting monitoring metrics, which depends on both workload requirements and hosting node guarantees. We introduce new abstractions for the components of a cluster in order to enable criticality-aware monitoring and orchestration of real-time industrial workloads. Finally, we design an orchestration system architecture that reflects the proposed model, introducing new components and prototyping a Kubernetes-based implementation, taking the first steps towards a fully I4.0-enabled orchestration system.},

Interoperating DLTs enable network effects and synergies, and similarly to the rise of the Internet, it unlocks the full potential of the technology. However, due to the novelty of the area, interoperability mechanisms (IMs) are still not well understood, as interoperability is studied in silos. Consequently, choosing the proper IM for a use case is challenging.Our article has three contributions: first, we systematically study the research area of DLT interoperability by dissecting and analyzing previous work. We study the logical separation of interoperability layers, how a DLT can connect to others (connection mode), the object of interoperation (interoperation mode), and propose a new categorization for IMs. Second, we propose the first interoperability assessment for DLTs that systematically evaluates the interoperability degree of an IM. This framework allows comparing the potentiality, compatibility, and performance among solutions.Finally, we propose two decision models to assist in choosing an IM, considering different requirements. The first decision model assists in choosing the infrastructure of an IM, while the second decision model assists in choosing its functionality.},

abstract = {Today, cloud computation offloading may not be an appropriate solution for delay-sensitive applications due to the long distance between end-devices and remote datacenters. In addition, offloading to a remote cloud can consume bandwidth and dramatically increase costs. However, end-devices such as sensors, cameras, and smartphones have limited computing and storage capacity. Processing tasks on such battery-powered and energy-constrained devices becomes even more complex. To address these challenges, a new paradigm called Edge Computing (EC) emerged nearly a decade ago to bring computing resources closer to end-devices. Here, edge servers located between the end-device and the remote cloud perform user tasks. Recently, several new computing paradigms such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) have emerged to complement Cloud Computing (CC) and EC. Although these paradigms are heterogeneous, they can further reduce energy consumption and task response time, especially for delay-sensitive applications. Computation offloading is a multi-objective, NP-hard optimization problem. A significant part of previous research in this field is devoted to Machine Learning (ML) methods. One of the essential types of ML is Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which an agent learns how to make the best decision using the experiences gained from the environment. This article provides a systematic review of the widely used RL approaches in computation offloading. It covers research in complementary paradigms such as mobile cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, and the Internet of Things. We explain the reasons for using various RL methods in computation offloading from a technical point of view. This analysis includes both binary offloading and partial offloading techniques. For each method, the essential elements of RL and the characteristics of the environment are discussed regarding the most important criteria. Research challenges and Future trends are also mentioned.},

abstract = {The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are the backbones of Industry 4.0, where data quality is crucial for decision support. Data quality in these systems can deteriorate due to sensor failures or uncertain operating environments. Our objective is to summarize and assess the research efforts that address data quality in data-centric CPS/IoT industrial applications. We systematically review the state-of-the-art data quality techniques for CPS and IoT in Industry 4.0 through a systematic literature review (SLR) study. We pose three research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria for primary studies, and extract and synthesize data from these studies to answer our research questions. Our most significant results are (i) the list of data quality issues, their sources, and application domains, (ii) the best practices and metrics for managing data quality, (iii) the software engineering solutions employed to manage data quality, and (iv) the state of the data quality techniques (data repair, cleaning, and monitoring) in the application domains. The results of our SLR can help researchers obtain an overview of existing data quality issues, techniques, metrics, and best practices. We suggest research directions that require attention from the research community for follow-up work.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) deployments have been growing manifold, encompassing sensors, networks, edge, fog, and cloud resources. Despite the intense interest from researchers and practitioners, most do not have access to large-scale IoT testbeds for validation. Simulation environments that allow analytical modeling are a poor substitute for evaluating software platforms or application workloads in realistic computing environments. Here, we propose a virtual environment for validating Internet of Things at large scales (VIoLET), an emulator for defining and launching large-scale IoT deployments within cloud VMs. It allows users to declaratively specify container-based compute resources that match the performance of native IoT compute devices using Docker. These can be inter-connected by complex topologies on which bandwidth and latency rules are enforced. Users can configure synthetic sensors for data generation as well. We also incorporate models for CPU resource dynamism, and for failure and recovery of the underlying devices. We offer a detailed comparison of VIoLET’s compute and network performance between the virtual and physical deployments, evaluate its scaling with deployments with up to 1, 000 devices and 4, 000 device-cores, and validate its ability to model resource dynamism. Our extensive experiments show that the performance of the virtual IoT environment accurately matches the expected behavior, with deviations levels within what is seen in actual physical devices. It also scales to 1, 000s of devices and at a modest cloud computing costs of under 0.15% of the actual hardware cost, per hour of use, with minimal management effort. This IoT emulation environment fills an essential gap between IoT simulators and real deployments.},

abstract = {In the Systems Engineering (SE) domain there has been a paradigm shift from document-based to model-based system development artefacts; in fact, new methodologies are emerging to meet the increasing complexity of current systems and the corresponding growing need of digital workflows. In this regard, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is considered as a key enabler by many central players of the SE community. MBSE has reached an adequate level of maturity and there exist documented success stories in its adoption in industry. In particular, one significant benefit of utilising MBSE when compared to the traditional manual and document-centric workflows is that models are available from early phases of systems development; these enable a multitude of analyses prior any implementation effort together with other relevant capabilities, like the automation of development tasks. Nonetheless, it is noticeable there is a lack of a common understanding for how formal analyses for the verification and validation (V&amp;V) of systems behaviour, specifically in the early phases of development, could be placed in an MBSE setting. In this article, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic literature review regarding the early V&amp;V of systems behaviour in the context of model-based systems engineering. The review aims to provide a structured representation of the state-of-the-art with respect to motivations, proposed solutions, and limitations. From an initial set of potentially relevant 701 peer-reviewed publications we selected 149 primary studies, which we analysed according to a rigorous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. Based on our results, early V&amp;V has usually the goal of checking the quality of a system design to avoid discovering flaws when parts are being concretely realised; SysML is a de facto standard for describing the system under study, while the solutions for the analyses tend to be varied; also V&amp;V analyses tend to target varied properties with a slight predominance of functional concerns, and following the variation mentioned so far the proposed solutions are largely context specific; the proposed approaches are usually presented without explicit limitations, while when limitations are discussed, readiness of the solutions, handling of analyses simplifications/assumptions, and languages/tools integration are among the most frequently mentioned issues. Based on the survey results and the standard SE practices, we discuss how the current state-of-the-art MBSE supports early V&amp;V of systems behaviour with a special focus on industrial adoption, and identify relevant challenges to be researched further.},

Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet fully proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.  

Onward! 2023 is co-located with SPLASH 2023, running from Sunday 22nd of October till Friday 27th of October, in Cascais, Portugal. We are delighted to have Felienne Hermans giving the Onward! keynote, on Wednesday 25th of October, on "Creating a learnable and inclusive programming language".  

All papers and essays that lie here before you received at least three reviews, leading to a decision of accept, reject, or conditional accept. Authors of conditionally accepted papers were provided with explicit requirements for acceptance, and were carefully re-reviewed in the second phase. The essays track received six submissions, out of which four were accepted. The papers track accepted nine out of nineteen submissions.  

We hope that the papers and essays in these proceedings will stimulate and challenge your thinking about programming and software engineering, and we are looking forward to many discussions at the conference.},
