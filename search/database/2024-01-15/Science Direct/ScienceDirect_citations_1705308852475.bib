abstract = {The concept of twinning an operational physical system with a functional replica is not new, having been practiced in the space sector for over 50 years. Advances in digitalisation have created opportunities to extract data, obtain insights and achieve greater situational awareness of a physical system’s performance. Increasing interest in the concept has led to a proliferation of digital twin definitions, which are used to frame discussions about specific digital twins. Consequentially comparison of the capabilities of specific digital twins is difficult as they are analysed using different definitions. This paper proposes an analysis framework that enables the characteristics of all digital twins to be matched to this framework. Using this framework, a digital twin may be characterised, or two or more digital twins may be compared. By establishing a framework that contains common functional characteristics, we aim to reduce the confusion caused by the plethora of digital twin definitions and their interpretation by suppliers. By focusing only on functionality and not addressing non-functional requirements the analysis allows comparison of different physical and logical instantiations of digital twins.}

abstract = {The complex future power plants require digital twin (DT) architecture to achieve high reliability, availability and maintainability at lower cost. The available research on DT for power plants is limited and lacks details on DT comprehensiveness and robustness. The main focus of the present study is to propose a comprehensive and robust DT architecture for power plants that can also be used for other similar complex capital-intensive large engineering systems. First, overviews are conducted for DT key research and development for power plants and related energy savings applications to provide current status, guidelines and research gaps. Then, the requirements and rules for the power plant DT are established and the major DT components are determined. These components include the physics-based formulations; the statistical analysis of data from the sensor network; the real-time data; the pre-performed localized in-depth simulations to predict activities of the corresponding physical twin; and the system Genome with a digital thread that connects all these components together. Recommendations and future directions are made for the power plant DT development including the need for real data and physical description of the overall system focusing on each component individually and on the overall connections. Data-driven algorithms with capabilities to predict the system’s dynamic behavior still need to be developed. The data-driven approach alone is not sufficient and a low-order physics based model should operate in tandem with the updated latest system parameters to allow interpretation and enhancing the results from the data-driven process. Discrepancies between the dynamic system models (DSM) and anomaly detection and deep learning (ADL) require in-depth localized off-line simulations. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the advantages of the developed ADL algorithm approach and DSM prediction of the DT using vector autoregressive model for anomaly detection in utility gas turbines with data from an operational power plant.}

abstract = {Today, the built environment is designed, built, and managed using digital technology, making it increasingly exposed to cyber security risks. Cybersecurity is a general topic, and the construction sector has been borrowing general solutions and frameworks. However, the construction industry is specific and needs a specialized framework that would assist in understanding and managing cybersecurity. We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering. Drawing from that, we developed an original framework that identifies three kinds of wrongful activities: stealing, lying, and harming. It identifies four elements that can be affected by wrongful activities: information asset, material asset, person, and system. It defines cybersecurity as the absence of the three wrongs across the four kinds of elements. The framework is construction-specific, and as such, a useful tool for senior management to understand security problems and organize security processes. It can lead to better standardization and also helps the researchers to structure future work on the topic. The latter should be concentrated in areas where construction was found to be different: the dynamic and overlapping process and organizational boundaries in the design stage, the exposed shared design information, and the vulnerability of control information of the built environment, particularly in critical infrastructures.}

In SG environment, the Smart Meters (SMs) mostly exchange services and data from Service Providers (SPs) via insecure public channel. This makes the entire SG ecosystem vulnerable to various security threats. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we incorporate Digital Twin (DT) technology, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain into the design of a novel SG network. Specifically, a secure communication channel is first designed using an authentication method based on blockchain technology that has the ability to withstand a number of well-known assaults. Second, a new DL architecture that includes a self-attention mechanism, a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, fully connected layers, and a softmax classifier is designed to enhance the attack detection process in SG environments. To deliver low latency and real-time services, the SDN is next employed as the network’s backbone to send requests from SMs to a global SDN controller. DT technology is finally integrated into the SDN control plane, which stores the operating states and behavior models of SMs and communicates with SMs. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the blockchain implementation used in the SG network to assess computing time for the various numbers of transactions per block. Finally, the numerical results based on the N-BaIoT dataset shows better intrusion detection.}

Typically, these systems are intended to monitor and manipulate real-environment processes and objects. There had been advancements in CPS that affect various aspects of human lives and enable a wider range of applications and services. However, the interconnectivity between the cyber and physical world in CPS introduces new threats and security challenges and also increases the attack surface. The CPS is more prone to cyber-attacks than physical attacks because of the high accessibility of cyber components than physical ones. If we consider the last decade, it is no longer a myth to see industries relying on CPS being a victim of security attacks. In this paper, considering the applicability and dangers of CPS, we thus presented the key security aspects of CPS by reviewing published literature since 2018. We have examined the CPS requirements, challenges, security methods, security standards, threats, vulnerabilities, and past attacks. Moreover, we have considered the role of machine learning and deep learning in the enhancement of the security of CPS and reviewed the performance of existing works, and analyzed the challenges faced, and possible improvement techniques to enhance performance. We identified some key issues and challenges (such as CPS constraints, the performance of learning models, and security of learning models) in the adaption of learning-based methods for CPS security and accordingly proposed a security framework for CPS. Finally, several suggestions and recommendations are proposed considering the lessons learned from the comprehensive review.}

The traditional schemes adopted centralized architectures and complex encryption algorithms that suffer from several cyber-security threats and latency making them unsuitable for resource-constrained IoTs devices. In our work, we proposed a decentralized, low-power consumption, fast, scalable, secure, privacy-preserving, and trusting architecture-based private blockchain network/smart contract and interplanetary file system for the petroleum industry in Iraq. Our scheme improves blockchain performance by adopting the incremental aggregator subsector commitment instated of Merkle tree and a multi-chain proof of rapid authentication as consensus algorithms, which are specially designed for industrial IoTs applications. It provides a high level of security authentication and privacy preservation, P2P communication, remote access, immutability, traceability, and information backtracking. In addition to addressing the blockchain storage limitation and eliminating third-party dependencies by adopting an interplanetary file system (IPFS). Also provides an efficient data encryption mechanism at the perceptual layer by adopting a lightweight encryption algorithm with internet friendly ARM Cortex-M33 Microcontroller as clear in the experimental results. Moreover, our architecture succeeds in merging blockchain technology, IoTs, and an IPFS with the petroleum industry as an industrial application area, and provides an efficient framework that resists common cyber-security attacks by achieving data integrity, availability, and confidentiality.}

Model-based planning and control can address the particularities of deformable object manipulation; however, their competence is heavily dependent on the models’ accuracy and reconstruction frequencies. Despite the many breakthroughs that have been achieved in real-time modelling and behavior prediction of deformable objects, the calibration of such models and the measurement of their accuracy remain a significant challenge. In this paper, a method for the definition of the physics parameters of flexible material reconstruction models is presented. The proposed systematic approach, employing a number of optimization algorithms, fine-tunes the model’s parameters for the real-world deformable object, as captured by the perception system, to be aligned with its digital twin. A mass-spring model for the reconstruction of two-dimensional fabric objects is used as an application paradigm. An experimental setup in an industrially relevant environment validates the applicability of the proposed approach and is used for assessing alternative sensing practices and optimization algorithms.}

DT refers to the integrated multiphysics, multiscale, and probabilistic representation of a real-world physical component. The current study attempts to well envisage the ways blockchain can restructure and transform DTs to provide secure manufacturing, assuring compliance, traceability, quality, authenticity, and safety. However, to the adoption of DTs and BT in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there are several barriers. To identify the key barriers, the present study discusses a survey approach through comprehensive literature and interviews with experts. To do so, this study introduced a novel approach using decision-making theory under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) to analyze the identified barriers. This study developed a new methodology called q-ROF-subjective and objective weight integrated approach (SOWIA)-weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS). An empirical case study to assess the barriers to employing BT into DTs for IIoT implementation in the era of Industry 4.0 is taken. Also, comparative work and sensitivity analysis are discussed to demonstrate the advantage of the presented approach.}

The common idea behind the IIoT is to connect digital devices and services with physical systems using sensors and actuators. The IIoT output a very enormous amount of data through resource-constrained devices (sensors). However, due to the heterogeneity of these devices and their limited resources, they are exposed to a multifariousness of threats that jeopardize IIoT’s ability to provide seamless operations to enterprises. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient security approaches to combat these threats and protect IIoT systems. To this end, some intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been enhanced in recent years. With the advent of intelligent approaches (IAs), most IDSs are based on Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning approaches and institutions are incorporating accurate IAs techniques in their real-world applications. Therefore, we survey recent efforts in the literature related to intrusion detection in IIoT, focusing on ML algorithms. We divide them into three categories: Agent Placement Strategy, Detection Method, and Security Problem. We pose a number of open questions and suggest some research directions.}

To attain this degree of efficiency, the integration of virtual and physical components reinforced by artificial intelligence also promises to improve the resilience of these systems against organised and often skillful adversaries. The ability to visualise, validate, and illustrate the benefits of this integration, while taking into account improvements in cyber modelling and simulation tools and procedures, is critical to that adoption. Using Cyber Modelling and Simulation (M&S) this study evaluates the scale and complexity required to achieve an acceptable level of cyber resilience testing in an IoT-enabled critical national infrastructure (CNI). This research focuses on the benefits and challenges of integrating cyber modelling and simulation (M&S) with digital twins and threat source characterisation methodologies towards a cost-effective security and resilience assessment. Using our dedicated DT environment, we show how adversaries can utilise cyber–physical systems as a point of entry to a broader network in a scenario where they are trying to attack a port.}

abstract = {Over the past decades, industries and governments have progressively been relying upon space data-centric and data-dependant systems. This led to the emergence of malicious activities, also known as cyber-threats, targeting such systems. To counter these threats, new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been implemented and deployed. Today, AI is highly capable of delivering fast, precise, and reliable command-and-control decision-making, as well as providing reliable vulnerability analysis using well-proven cutting-edge techniques, at least when applied to terrestrial applications. In fact, this might not yet be the case when used for space applications. AI can also play a transformative and important role in the future of space cybersecurity, and it poses questions on what to expect in the near-term future. Challenges and opportunities deriving from the adoption of AI-based solutions to achieve cybersecurity and later cyber defence objectives in both civil and military operations require rethinking of a new framework and new ethical requirements. In fact, most of these technologies are not designed to be used or to overcome challenges in space. Because of the highly contested and congested environment, as well as the highly interdisciplinary nature of threats to AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, including cybersecurity issues, a solid and open understanding of the technology itself is required, as well as an understanding of its multidimensional uses and approaches. This includes the definition of legal and technical frameworks, ethical dimensions and other concerns such as mission safety, national security, and technology development for future uses. The continuous endeavours to create a framework and regulate interdependent uses of combined technologies such as AI and cybersecurity to counter “new” threats require the investigation and development of “living concepts” to determine in advance the vulnerabilities of networks and AI. This paper defines a cybersecurity risk and vulnerability taxonomy to enable the future application of AI in the space security field. Moreover, it assesses to what extent a network digital twins’ simulation can still protect networks against relentless cyber-attacks in space against users and ground segments. Both concepts are applied to the case study of Earth Observation (EO) operations, which allows for conclusions to be drawn based on the business impact (reputational, environmental, and social) of a cyber malicious activity. Since AI technologies are developing on a daily basis, a regulatory framework is proposed using ethical and technical approaches for this technology and its use in space.}

abstract = {With the emergence of the Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs) along with the fourth industrial revolution, the discussion of distributed architecture and coordination and extensive communication between all components of a system was raised. On the other hand, Modern industrial manufacturing relies heavily on flexible production. Autonomous mobile manipulators (MMs) have the potential to improve the flexibility of existing manufacturing environments. With the advantages associated with this technology, there is an upsurge in the demand for MMs. Thus, adding a new MM as a new CPS into a system following industry 4.0 requires a framework to help taking all the advantages from it. In this article, we proposed a framework to integrating MMs as CPSs into an existing production system. This integration requires comprehensive knowledge of the existing production process and control, which is a view to improve the performance of the existing production systems via new functionalities due to MMs. The next step of the framework is to make new MM operations compatible with the existing production control system. For this purpose, we define different parametric blocks to perform new operations and thus contribute to making the production line more autonomous. Considering all of these issues simultaneously is necessary for an efficient integration in smart production context. For a successful integration, we presented four principal dimensions of integration: Physical integration, communicational integration, functional and operational integration, and digital integration. Furthermore, the framework has been applied to a research production line called Platform 4.0 at Arts et Métiers. An MM from OMRON Company (called MoMa) has been integrated into the existing production system. Results from this real-world demonstration show that MoMa is capable of successfully increasing flexibility, autonomy, and efficiency of a production system using command signals from Manufacturing Execution System (MES).}

Therefore, scalable methods for verifying security properties of manufacturing systems are paramount. This paper presents an approach to guarantee security of C2PS using concepts from Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) to describe the security properties of cloud constructs. We prove that composability is an essential property for enhancing the security of the C2PS. Furthermore, it also provides good scalability to the system. We propose formalisms required for modelling security properties in the Industrial IoT-based manufacturing system. Using this formalism and Hoares’ logic we provide conditions for composing systems. Finally, we provide strong authentication conditions among entity pairs in C2PS based manufacturing systems.

The IIoT systems generate a large amount of private and sensitive data i.e., stored and processed somewhere on the cloud-edge continuum. The IIoT devices, and the IIoT networks are subject to security mechanisms such as intelligent Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) systems, that can detect and respond unseen malicious network attacks. The adoption of centralized machine learning methods for IDS has become impractical due to the high computational cost and privacy concerns associated with storing large amounts of data on a single server along the cloud-edge continuum. The combination of federated learning and Blockchain has emerged as a promising advancement in addressing the challenge. Federated learning distributes learning to individual IIoT devices without compromising data privacy, while Blockchain enhances privacy and security. Many academic and industrial efforts outline IDS mechanisms using machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and Blockchain technologies. The utilization of federated learning-based IDS has become increasingly popular and is now being applied to various tasks including IDS/IPS systems. However, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) survey are limited to the scope of classical machine learning and deep learning. To address this limitation, we analyze the IIoT literature that integrates Blockchain and federated learning to enhance IDSs and improve its threat detection capabilities. This survey explores the role of Blockchain and federated learning in addressing security and privacy issues, particularly those associated with IDS/IPS in IIoT networks. Insights on the possibilities of machine learning, federated learning, and Blockchain in supporting IDS to monitor IIoT network traffic for anomaly detection are discussed in detail through state of the art. Furthermore, we provide a set of recommendation based on our literature for the effective implementation of a Blockchain and federated learning-based network intrusion detection system. Finally, we summarize the study and highlight challenges as future research directions for Blockchain and Federated Learning-based technologies for cybersecurity and intrusion detection in IIoT.}

This paradigm allows customers and production service providers to meet on a virtual platform, and from there, to generate business opportunities. In turn, different production service providers can associate with each other, in such a way that each one can enhance the level of service they offer or even take advantage of their idle capacity by offering it to other providers. These advantages have increased the interest in Cloud Manufacturing, yielding a wide number of architectures and systems that enable these interactions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study about these architectures, as well as a review of the current literature on the subject. For this, a systematic review of the literature is reported. Based on an in-depth review of the selected works, we were able to identify the main contributions of the current state of the literature about Cloud Manufacturing architectures. Four lines of research were identified that should be strengthened and expanded in the future to continue with the development of this paradigm. These lines are: (i) digital twins developments, (ii) scheduling and logistics, (iii) services composition and resources sharing and (iv) interoperability. Finally, it is presented an open-source project for Cloud Manufacturing architectures and their implementation, which emerge from the literature review as a promising tool to leverage Cloud Manufacturing technologies.}

However, they have found challenges in linking these technologies and developing an autonomous, well-established digital framework for applications of SHM. Visualizing processed SHM data in a real-time digital interface generates multiple obstacles, such as witnessing delays in data transfer and resorting to offline tools for manual data processing. This paper, therefore, explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) through an Arduino micro-processing unit for tracking and visualizing the data from the time and frequency domains. Strategies for enabling data monitoring and processing are developed while continuously acquiring structural responses. The query of data is established in a web-based database instead of storing the data in offline resources that await manual intervention. The proposed real-time SHM methodology is validated experimentally using two practical applications: a dynamically moving vehicle over a simply-supported bridge prototype and a randomly excited three-story model with real-time visualization of both time- and frequency-domain information under undamaged and damaged conditions. The proposed research develops an early-phase Digital Twin (DT) to present static and real-time dynamic data in a rich-fed BIM database.}

However, a wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into integrated networks, including smart grid (SG). SG security studies are carried out on physical test-beds to train and test cyber attacks in a safe/controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying physical configuration and scalability. To overcome these shortcomings, we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for cyber security studies on SGs. The twin enable users to deploy real world attacks and countermeasures, and study its effectiveness. In the twin users may easily modify the components and configurations unlike in a physical test-bed. Further, reproducing the twin for advancing the research is significantly cheaper. We illustrate the typical use case with an example case study.}

Due to the rising number of cyber-attacks that target critical Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), organisations are required to consider such attacks as severe business risks. Therefore, identifying potential cyber threats and analysing their impacts is crucial to business continuity planning. This paper proposes a structured threat modelling approach for ICPS that enables prediction and analysis of cyber risks to protect industrial assets from potential cyber-attacks. The method involves classifying ICPS assets based on criticality, and then analysing the cyber security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, impacts, and countermeasures. The proposed methodology enables end-to-end threat modelling through the development of a new framework that is integrated with VueOne digital twin tool to model and analyse threats throughout ICPS lifecycle, identifying cyber risks and proposing mitigation controls. Moreover, it uses meta-data extracted from VueOne tool to automatically generate the software code and hardware configurations that can be directly deployed on ICPS assets in order to implement the countermeasures, thereby protecting them from these potential cyber-attacks. The proposed solution has been implemented on a Festo test rig prototype production line.}

We propose a cryptographic scheme to be applied in an automation network which cipher events without altering the size or structure of the transmitted data. In addition, the proposed cryptographic scheme leads to small communication delays, which makes it suitable for application in automation networks. We call this scheme event-based cryptography, where an event is defined as any change in the binary signals transmitted in the network. In order to do so, we propose a method for the codification of events as event vectors, which is suitable for encryption. We also propose the use of a stream cipher called ChaCha20, which is known to have a high resistance to cryptanalysis. A simulated example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed event-based cryptography, and to make a comparison with the RSA cipher, a public-key cipher widely used in Information Technology.}

abstract = {The public has regarded Edge-AI enabled Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as the crucial foundation in the intelligent digital factories in Industry 4.0. It can fully catch the massive production data derived from the complex production process, and provide efficient, intelligent services. However, the deployment of edge AI aggravates the complexity and security risks caused by the massive heterogeneous resource-constrained and vulnerable edge IIoT devices. Effective fault prevention is crucial to ensure the security and robustness of the IIoT with numerous vulnerable edge devices. Most existing solutions are based on the history log, which can hardly defend against attacks and is easy to cause excessive maintenance. To address this issue, we propose a trustworthy self-healing scheme based on the combination of distributed digital twin (DT) and blockchain, to ensure the security and robustness of the industrial system network. We first propose an implementation architecture of the distributed DT based self-healing IIoT to apply the distributed DT simulation capability fully. In addition, we provide a DT simulation operating mechanism for the controlled industrial devices, considering the requirement of users and constrained resources of edge servers. Moreover, this work proposes a blockchain-based decentralized trust management mechanism to ensure the reliability of self-healing. The security analysis and performance evaluation show the security and efficiency of our proposal.}

A smart grid uses advanced digital technologies, including sensors, communication networks, and analytics software, to optimize the distribution and consumption of energy in real time. The future of distributed generation is promising. As more people adopt renewable energy systems like rooftop solar panels, the demand for traditional centralized power grids will decrease. This creates opportunities for smaller, community-based microgrids that can generate and distribute energy locally. By leveraging digital technologies like Digital Twin, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and artificial intelligence, these microgrids would improve energy efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance reliability. Overall, the combination of distributed energy generation and digital technologies has the potential to revolutionize the energy industry, making it more sustainable, resilient, and equitable.

While attack graphs have been widely utilised in the IT cyber domain, their use in Operational Technology (OT) environments requires new approaches able to properly model and analyse Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In this paper, we introduce Cyber-Physical Attack Graphs (CPAGs) as a class of attack graphs able to cover both cyber and physical aspects. CPAGs aim at extending the reach of standard attack graphs to cyber-physical networks typically observed in industrial environments and critical infrastructure systems, analyse how an attacker can move within the network, and understand the impact that these actions may have on the system. We propose a constructive methodology to design CPAGs backed up by a formal rule-based approach that specifies how integral parts of the model can be generated and later composed to build more complex CPAGs. We then explore the semantics of CPAGs associated to cyber and physical attack actions as well as their impact on CPS environments. We also discuss potential CPAG-based analysis techniques and focus on risk analysis using Bayesian CPAGs. Finally, we show the application of the proposed model over a realistic scenario on smart farming using our open source tool T-CITY.}

Even if many researchers and policymakers have advocated for engineering education since early education, it is usually kept for undergraduate and graduate-level education. What prevents systems theory and control education from being integrated into K12 education is the lack of available educational resources and the lack of indicators to represent the learning gain of students. To help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (CPHS). The paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a CPHS where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. The entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system.}

The convergence of the Internet of Anything (IoX), software-defined communication layer, and sophisticated cloud platform has steered the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution era (Industry 4.0). The technological leap forward has given shelter to the umbrella of cyber-physical systems such as Smart Grids, Agriculture, and Healthcare. The exponential growth of vulnerable spots (the Internet of Things) in multi-layer cyber-physical systems is involuntarily contributing to malignant IoT-generated denial-of-service attacks. The IoT devices manifest a high degree of diversity in traffic patterns, and a single dataset is insufficient to cover fiducial attack scenarios. In addition, the research community is pressing to overcome other roadblocks, such as an optimal architecture for solution efficacy, performance issues, and the need for comprehensive validation of the proposed solutions.
Methods
The paper offers a five-stage defense framework for building a mitigation against IoT-based DDoS attacks. The article brings forth an amalgamated dataset concocted from InSDN, BoT-IoT, and UNSW-Sydney datasets and a simulated dataset for IoT-DDoS to the research community. The paper employs a multi-stage Stack-Ensembled framework at the heart of the solution pillared on physical devices' behavioral attributes, resulting in a universal defense approach. The experiment leverages fog computing with distributed computational nodes to reduce response latency. Furthermore, the paper implements attack-detection-as-a-service on top of the Docker framework for a cost-effective, reusable, and portable framework. The novel design of the framework presents a light mitigation scheme to the SDN controller, ensuring a negligible impact on the controller's performance.
Results and Discussion
The hand-crafted feature selection process reduced the features by 80%, demonstrating a high accuracy of 99.99% with benchmark datasets, 98.84% accuracy in the simulation environment, and collateral damage of 1.52%. The experiment observes encouraging values for vital performance parameters that researchers often miss to discuss. Furthermore, the paper thoroughly analyzes IoT-DDoS mitigation framework performance parameters.}

Consequently, there is a greater need for their ability to perform their required functions under expected and unexpected adverse events. Moreover, the multitude of threats and their rapid evolution pushes the development of approaches that go beyond pure technical reliability, rather encompassing multi-dimensional performance of a socio-technical system. These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.}

Existing research on AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing is supported by classical references, which can be divided into four significant co-citation clusters, including the theory of security and privacy in CPS, DL-based IDS, DDoS attacks on CPS by botnet, and FL method for privacy-preserved data sharing. Finally, this study predicted four potential future research directions for the research field of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing: the well-structured and representative dataset for model training, methods for resisting PUF attacks against ML techniques, DL-based methods for detecting and resisting botnets, and lightweight FL-based methods for privacy-preserved data sharing. The findings of this study can guide researchers in this field for future collaboration and work.}

This chapter provides a holistic definition for supply chain cyber security and conducts a thorough review of both nonacademic industry sources and the academic literature. Through analysis of industry sources, 18 common best practice principles are identified. These are classified hierarchically—strategic (e.g., supply chain cyber vulnerability and threat identification), tactical (e.g., cyber security education of employees), and operational (e.g., real-time cyber security monitoring). The review of the academic literature complements existing reviews by including the most recent studies, identifying the most significant, and classifying the research. The most common research topics are noted, the main quantitative methodologies deployed are identified, and technology-specific supply chain security research is highlighted. Lastly, 19 key questions for supply chain cyber security research are posed under four categories—modeling and theoretical foundations, implementation of security strategies, interactions between theory and practice, and the analysis of real-world cases.}

For this, a special type of twin denoted as sensor signal-based twin must be constructed and adapted into the cyber-physical systems. The twin must (1) machine-learn the required knowledge from the historical sensor signal datasets, (2) seamlessly interact with the real-time sensor signals, (3) handle the semantically annotated datasets stored in clouds, and (4) accommodate the data transmission delay. The development of such twins has not yet been studied in detail. This study fills this gap by addressing sensor signal-based digital twin development for intelligent machine tools. Two computerized systems denoted as Digital Twin Construction System (DTCS) and Digital Twin Adaptation System (DTAS) are proposed to construct and adapt the twin, respectively. The modular architectures of the proposed DTCS and DTAS are presented in detail. The real-time responses and delay-related computational arrangements are also elucidated for both systems. The systems are also developed using a Java™-based platform. Milling torque signals are used as an example to demonstrate the efficacy of DTCS and DTAS.

However, the dynamic features and heterogeneous resources in 6G-enabled IoT make the resource allocation for computation-intensive and delay-sensitive DTs services more challenging. In this paper, we first define the DTs implementation process as a DT service function chain (DTSFC) and address the resource allocation problem of DTs-empowered networks in form of dynamic DTSFCs orchestration.

abstract = {Introduction:
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a technology that connects devices to collect data and conduct in-depth analysis to provide value-added services to industries. The integration of the physical and digital domains is crucial for unlocking the full potential of the IIoT, and digital twins can facilitate this integration by providing a virtual representation of real-world entities.
Objectives:
By combining digital twins with the IIoT, industries can simulate, predict, and control physical behaviors, enabling them to achieve broader value and support industry 4.0 and 5.0. Constituents of cooperative IIoT domains tend to interact and collaborate during their complicated operations.
Methods:
To secure such interaction and collaborations, we introduce a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication protocol for IIoT. The blockchain maintains only each domain’s dynamic accumulator, which accumulates crucial materials derived from devices, decreasing the overhead. In addition, we use the on-chain accumulator to effectively validate the unlinkable identities of cross-domain IIoT devices.
Results:
The implementation of the concept reveals the fact that our protocol is efficient and reliable. This efficiency and reliability of our protocol is also substantiated through comparison with state-of-the-art literature. In contrast to related protocols, our protocol exhibits a minimum 22.67% increase in computation cost efficiency and a 16.35% rise in communication cost efficiency.
Conclusion:
The developed protocol guarantees data transfer security across the domain and thwarts IoT devices from potential physical attacks. Additionally, in order to protect privacy, anonymity and unlinkability are also guaranteed.}

In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including system testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security testing, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle. However, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envisions a blockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical Systems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework through a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through Integrity Checking Mechanisms (ICMs). Additionally, Safety and Security (S&S) rules evaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain, thereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by the underlying systems. Finally, we perform formal verification of the TTS-CPS.}

In recent literature, machine learning (ML) techniques and, more recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been used by several studies to implement cybersecurity countermeasures against cyberattacks in SG-CPS. Nevertheless, the achieving high performance of these state-of-the-art techniques is constrained by certain challenges, including hyperparameter optimization, feature extraction and selection, lack of models’ transparency, data privacy, and lack of real-time attack data.

We observe the insufficiency and costliness of design-time measures in prevention of anomalies. As our main contribution, our methodology is taking advantage of this data-rich environment by means of Extra-Functional Behaviour (EFB) monitoring, analytics pipelines and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, we demonstrate the use of compartmentalisation of execution timelines into distinct units, i.e., execution phases. We introduce the generation of representations for these phases, i.e., behavioural signatures and behavioural passports, as our way of behavioural fingerprinting. Composed using regression modelling techniques, signatures as the representation of ongoing behaviour, are compared to passports, representing reference behaviour. The comparison is done by means of goodness-of-fit scores, creating quantifiable measures of deviation between different recorded behaviours. We have used both partially synthetic and real-world traces in our experiments, depending on the use-case. We have also followed both white box and black box approaches for our use-cases, with discussions on the pros and cons of each. The effectiveness of our data-centric methodology is demonstrated by two proofs-of-concept from the industry, to represent the two ends of the industrial CPS complexity spectrum, with one being a large semiconductor photolithography machine, while the other is an image analysis platform. Each use-case comes with its own characteristics and limitations, confirming the flexibility of our methodology and the relevance of its integral steps in the approach towards the initial analysis and data transformations.

abstract = {In recent years, circular business models (CBM) have become an inevitable requirement to foster improvements in environmental performance. However, the current literature rarely discusses the link between Internet of Things (IoT) and CBM. This paper first identifies four IoT capabilities including monitoring, tracking, optimization and design evolution for improving CBM performance based on the ReSOLVE framework. In a second step, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach analyzes how these capabilities contribute to 6 R and CBM through the CBM-6R and CBM-IoT cross-section heatmaps and relationship frameworks, followed by assessing the quantitative impacts of IoT on potential energy saving in CBM. Finally, challenges are analyzed for the realization of IoT-enabled CBM. The results show that the assessments of Loop and Optimize business models dominate current studies. IoT plays a significant role in these business models respectively through tracking, monitoring and optimization capabilities. While (quantitative) case studies for Virtualize, Exchange and Regenerate CBM are substantially needed. IoT holds the potential to reduce energy consumption by around 20–30% for referenced applications in the literature. However, the IoT hardware, software and protocol energy consumption, interoperability, security and financial investment might become main obstacles for the wider use of IoT in CBM.}

However, the area is not yet well structured and, therefore, it is essential to review and analyze recent work in this field to better understand the adopted approaches and also to identify corresponding gaps and future interesting research directions. This article is based on a systematic literature review that addresses core issues in CPS security. Part of the focus is placed on the defense mechanisms introduced to help the system fully recover from attacks. However, the framework devoted to risk/threat assessments has also been highlighted, as there is a substantial need to strengthen the systems architecture to be more proactive. In addition, the ethical and societal impact of CPS is emphasized since it is essential to get a vision of the unintended outcomes of the possible evolution of these systems.}

IoT devices are used for different purposes, such as security, remote monitoring, resource allocation, threats, ecosystems, and vulnerabilities. This paper proposed a deep learning algorithm-based solution to tighten the security level in the IoT-Smart environment network. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) considered in this paper is Network IDS, which investigates the manufacturer usage description, digital twins, and deep learning-based user behavior information. IoT devices' communication and the users in smart buildings are automatically connected in the Intelligent Communication system. Since many devices and users are interconnected in smart buildings, the probability of cyber-attack is high. Thus, better security is needed in smart buildings and smart environments. It should focus on securing IoT devices, users, and their communication. Hence, this paper developed a deep learning-based anomaly detection framework to dynamically monitor the issues and problems with MUD profiles and detect the anomaly behavior. The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) profiles, dynamic user behavior, IoT devices' traffic data the pattern of abnormal/anomaly traffic at the device level is predicted while traffic occurs.

abstract = {Apart from conventional centralized control and administration, power systems entered the smart grid era, whilst the burgeoning Industry 4.0 demanded production and distribution in terms of digital data exchange and IoE (Internet of Everything)-based platforms. The usage of a digital twin in power system operation is an advanced version of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things). In terms of a more secure and dependable grid network, interconnected cloud architecture and online remote administration provide effective vulnerability management. Yet, to fully exploit the promise of digital twin technology in the electric grid, a conceptual framework is required to define the critical parts and procedures involved in constructing and deploying a digital twin system. A conceptual framework based on systems engineering approaches is proposed in this paper which takes the electric grid’s particular characteristics, such as system complexity, the necessity for real-time surveillance and control, and the significance of security and dependability into consideration. Accelerating the adoption of digital twin technologies in the electric grid can be made viable through the establishment of a well-defined and comprehensive development framework. This approach will contribute to the realization of a power system that is characterized by enhanced stability, efficiency, and sustainability. Considering the issue to be a multivariable optimization problem, a systems engineering approach is chosen based on component-based modeling, overall system configuration, and functional analysis.}

abstract = {The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT’s structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.}

DTs may be beneficial in the industrial sector, healthcare, and agriculture. The interaction of contemporary technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud storage, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the basis of DTs. DTs strength and potential are derived from these technological foundations. They provide DTs with unmatched accuracy and efficiency for simulating, monitoring, and enhancing physical systems. We must acknowledge, though, that the combination of these technologies presents serious security issues. The difficult problem of security needs to be resolved in order for DTs to reach their full potential. The highest degree of authenticity, privacy, and accessibility must be used to protect the virtual self. In DT technology, security covers a wide range of issues, from protected data storage to impenetrable communication channels. Secure essential infrastructure, private data, and proactive monitoring technologies are necessary to create a more robust digital environment. Maintaining the safety of these components is essential for DT systems to continue functioning securely and dependably, in addition to removing any hazards.}

Therefore, this chapter aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of process data analytic platforms built around the concept of Industry 4.0. First, it presents a brief overview of the industrial revolution followed by a high-level system architecture of a process data analytic platform. This system architecture consists of four elements: hardware and sensing layer, data management layer, application layer, and networking layer. The chapter provides a comprehensive overview of each of these elements while focussing on IIoT, data analytics and example applications that include predictive maintenance, remaining useful life estimation, process reliability assessment, and cyber-physical systems. As the physical and cyber domains of Industry 4.0 based process data analytics platforms are more integrated, the chapter presents the cyber-physical implications of such tight integration. The chapter concludes with a summary and outlook for Industry 4.0 based process data analytics platforms (PDAP).}

The top layer of the proposed architecture consists of the designed automatic voltage regulation (AVR) application, which has access to voltage measurements and grid parameters from the LV distribution grid, both current and historical. The AVR application solves a constrained optimization problem, which provides a set of local control set-points that bring the voltage across the grid within bounds. The middle layer consists of a local Volt/VAR controller, which is adjusted by the AVR app, while the bottom layer is the inner-loop controller of the PV inverter. The proposed method not only improves the voltage quality in the grid but also manages the reactive power outputs of PV inverters efficiently. A digital twin of the cyber-physical system has also been employed that interacts with the control system to ensure its appropriate operation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a representative low-voltage feeder located in Denmark.}

abstract = {A cyber-physical system (CPS) is an interconnected physical system that can be monitored, controlled, and operated remotely. A systems-based analysis of CPS is critical for enhancing operational safety and security. Such analysis is particularly important in light of the evolving Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) which is largely driven by CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), algorithmic systems, automation, and smart manufacturing. As a result of industries’ and societies’ growing dependence on CPSs, their safe and secure applications need to be scrutinized to avoid any threats or harm to processes and human lives. In order to achieve this target, the current work analyzes the literature to investigate challenges and opportunities present in the CPSs. The analysis attempts to answer the following Research Questions (RQs): (RQ1) What are the prominent trends in the field of safety and security of CPSs? (RQ2) What are the opportunities in Industry 4.0 technologies related to safety? (RQ3) What characteristics of CPSs are likely to cause safety and security issues? (RQ4) What are the emerging safety and security issues introduced by CPSs? (RQ5) How were these issues addressed in the literature? CPSs can address some traditional safety issues due to characteristics like high efficiency and control. However, a CPS is challenged by heterogeneity, dependencies, complexity, unattended nature, increased machine intelligence, autonomous reconfiguration, and uncertainties. Safety and security challenges include opaque system failure, complex socio-technical system, human-machine interface, cyber-physical attacks, unsecured remote configuration, lack of standards, and resilience. The paper is structured under the following key headings: bibliometric results, opportunities from Industry 4.0 technologies, issues introduced by Industry 4.0 technologies, literature proposed solutions, and research challenges. Based on the assessment of about 900 relevant publications extracted from two databases (Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection and Engineering village (EV)), the documents were categorized into eight major divisions: (i) Safety Opportunities, (ii) Hazardous Characteristics, (iii) Fault Occurrence, (iv) Cyber-physical attacks, (v) Human factors, (vi) occupational Health and safety, (vii) standards, and (viii) Reliability and resiliency. Proactive strategies were classified under four options: identification, evaluation, prevention, and management. The paper also raises some research needs and unanswered questions that require further analysis to address how security and safety mechanisms can introduce more complexity in the system that can lead to new risks. The paper concludes by emphasizing digital process safety as part of the engineering curriculum to address the process industry's need for digital solutions and to make process safety learning a conscious choice.}

The authors of this study offered a scoping review of DT technologies with a primary emphasis on power systems. It has been established that the underlying notion behind this technology, as well as its operating principle, types, communication channels and protocols, and standards, have all been thoroughly examined. In addition, the possibility of integrating other technologies with DT has also been considered, along with the potential benefits of doing so and the potential difficulties that may arise. Based on the information gained from the current projects, the finished projects, the research publications, as well as the research and industry insights, a critical discussion has been made.}

abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a system of interconnected devices that, via the use of various technologies, such as soft sensors, cloud computing, data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, provides real-time insight into the operations of any industrial process from product conceptualisation, process optimisation and manufacturing to the supply chain. IIoT enables wide-scope data collection and utilisation, and reduces errors, increases efficiency, and provides an improved understanding of the process in return. While this novel solution is the pillar of Industry 4.0, the inherent operational complexity of bioprocessing arising from the involvement of living systems or their components in manufacturing renders the sector a challenging one for the implementation of IIoT. A large segment of the industry comprises the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals and advanced therapies, some of the most valuable biotechnological products available, which undergo tight regulatory evaluations and scrutinization from product conceptualisation to patient delivery. Extensive process understanding is what biopharmaceutical industry strives for, however, the complexity of transition into a new mode of operation, potential misalignment of priorities, the need for substantial investments to facilitate transition, the limitations imposed by the downtime required for transition and the essentiality of regulatory support, render it challenging for the industry to adopt IIoT solutions to integrate with biomanufacturing operations. There is currently a need for universal solutions that would streamline the implementation of IIoT and overcome the widespread reluctance observed in the sector, which will recommend accessible implementation strategies, effective employee training and offer valuable insights in return to advance any processing and manufacturing operation within their respective regulatory frameworks.}

abstract = {Recent attention is focused on interlinked (networked) hybrid connected microgrids (MGs) because of their technical and economic benefits over traditional ones. A system like that would connect the DC resources, such as solar energy, to DC busses and the AC resources, such as wind turbines, to AC busses. Therefore, the system's overall performance is remarkably improved. In addition, it is cost-effective compared to traditional grids since no power electronics are required to convert DC to AC. While a system like this has numerous benefits, it also has numerous challenges. System-level energy management (EM), for example, presents greater challenges because each change in the subsystem (DC/AC sections) may potentially alter the EM for the whole grid. Therefore, the present study develops the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for finding the optimum solution. Additionally, blockchain (BC) technology has been applied for increasing the security of power trading in hybrid MGs (HMGs). Stochastic load flow, according to a copula model, is used to create a realistic layout. According to the results, the suggested networked HMG-EM structure based on BC is demonstrated as being effective.}

Changes are primarily due to increased product complexity and the connection to the internet of things and services, enabling Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). Major innovations of the revised VDI guideline 2206 for developing mechatronic systems are systems thinking as a core element and six checkpoints for structuring deliverables along the V-Model. These checkpoints serve for orientation in result progress and thus enable a structured and complete development process. However, tasks and checkpoints of the new guideline focus on the product development itself without integrating the development of related CPPS, enabling optimization simultaneously to system development. Implications are derived by a three-step analysis. The paper at hand contributes fundamental extensions of the checkpoint questions regarding integrated CPPS development. These questions provide methodical support for system developers of CPPS for CPS by enabling the project manager to check the status, schedule further development steps and evaluate the maturity of the whole, integrated development.}

The fusion of IoT, ICT, and Smart Home delivers interactive solutions to reduce costs and resource consumption, enhance performance, and engage people's needs more virtually and proactively. A smart home has numerous advantages with the integration of emerging advanced technologies. Big data, centralization, data and resource allocation, security, and privacy issues persist as challenges in IoT-enabled Smart Home Networks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a GRU-based Digital Twin Framework for Data Allocation in IoT-enabled Smart Home Networks. Data and resource allocation of smart home applications are completed at the virtual twin layer using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based Digital Twin Networks. Low-priority data is stored and processed at the Macro-based Stations (MBSs), and high-priority data is transferred to the upper (Security) layer for authentication and validation. Blockchain-based distributed networks are utilized for Smart Home Data authentication at the security layer with a Proof of Authentication (PoAh) Consensus Algorithm; Data is stored at the cloud layer after validation. The validation results of the proposed framework demonstrate superior performance as the quantitative analysis with accuracy 0.9412, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.0588 for IoT-enable Smart Home compared to existing works as LSTM-based Digital Twin network and provide a secure environment in IoT-enabled Smart Home.}

A DT enables interaction with the digital image of the industrial physical objects/processes to simulate, analyze, and control their real-time operation. DT is rapidly diffusing in numerous industries with the interdisciplinary advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research trends in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G-and-Beyond networks) and design tools, and current computational intelligence paradigms (e.g., edge and cloud computing-enabled data analytics, federated learning). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT’s adoption.}

Owing to advancements in the use of technologies related to Industry 4.0 pillars, such as the Internet of Things, Big Data analytics, and simulation, the potential of DTs to profoundly impact manufacturing has been recognised. However, DT implementation is challenging. In practice, manufacturing companies that consider DT implementation may encounter several challenges, which can prevent the achievement of its potential benefits and impede its successful realization. Research on this topic lacks empirical evidence and models to guide practitioners to overcome this problem. Therefore, the aim of this study was to map the key challenges related to DT implementation in manufacturing contexts and propose a set of possible countermeasures. To achieve this objective, we conducted a Delphi study involving 15 experts, both practitioners and academics. The process required three rounds. In the first round, the experts were requested to provide a personalized list of potential challenges to DT implementation. In the second round, the experts evaluated the challenges from the literature and their suggested potential challenges, providing a measure of relevance. Furthermore, experts were asked to propose possible countermeasures to these challenges. Finally, a third round achieved consensus. The study identified 18 key challenges divided into four categories and proposed a set of possible countermeasures to overcome these problems. Moreover, a relevance/agreement matrix of the key challenges was proposed to establish a relative impact.}

abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, share valuable knowledge of the underlying physical processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to Cyber–Physical System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’ security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally, experimental validation has been carried out to demonstrate the viability of ENIGMA.}

One such novel technology is based on the digital twining of battery systems. Digital twins (DTs) of batteries utilize advanced multi-layer models, artificial intelligence, advanced sensing units, Internet-of-Things technologies, and cloud computing techniques to provide a virtual live representation of the real battery system (the physical twin) to improve the performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, they orchestrate the operation of the entire battery value chain offering great advantages, such as improving the economy of manufacturing, re-purposing, and recycling processes. In this context, various studies have been carried out discussing the DT applications and use cases from cloud-enabled battery management systems to the digitalization of battery testing. This work provides a comprehensive review of different possible use cases, key enabling technologies, and requirements for battery DTs. The review inclusively discusses the use cases, development/integration platforms, as well as hardware and software requirements for implementation of the battery DTs, including electrical topics related to the modeling and algorithmic approaches, software architectures, and digital platforms for DT development and integration. The existing challenges are identified and circumstances that will create enough value to justify these challenges, such as the added costs, are discussed.}

These are essential to Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing because they give users access to real-time operating data of the equipment they represent. Cyber components and physical components make up the two elements of CPS. The main aim of this paper is to brief CPS and its need for Industry 4.0. Embedded Processes and Smart 5C diagrammatically elaborate architecture of CPS for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of CPS in Industry 4.0. For this paper, we identified and then studied relevant literature on CPS for establishing an Industry 4.0 environment. CPS is integrated into several items, including vehicles and other equipment, to carry out particular functions. CPS can be utilised in any industry, including engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and even health care, because they are all easy to use. CPS network collaborative systems are built for communication. Furthermore, cutting-edge network technologies like cloud solutions are used by CPS.}
