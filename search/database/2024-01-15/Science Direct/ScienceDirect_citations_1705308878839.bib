As a promising solution, the emergence Digital Twin (DT) offers enhanced digital mapping capability with strong feasibility, security, economic and intelligence, which fits well with the concept of Industrial Internet. In this paper, we focus on establishing a new reference architecture of DT to support the development of Industrial Internet. It is composed of three interdependent layers (i.e., physical layer, DT layer and DT networks layer) and four critical attributes (i.e., privacy, security, awareness and real-time). We illustrate our perspectives for the functionality and relationship of the three layers, and features and feasible solutions of the four attributes. With those efforts, the proposed DT architecture can provide both smart manufacturing and networked services for Industrial Internet era. Moreover, we also illustrate the relevant and open challenges. Finally, the conclusion and future perspective are pointed out.}

However, the current IIoHT healthcare frameworks have security and failure issues in mobile fog and cloud networks where they are spread out. This paper presents the secure, fault-tolerant IIoHT Framework based on digital twin (DT) federated learning-enabled fog-cloud models. The DT is an effective technology that makes virtual copies of servers at different locations.

The study aims to reduce processing time and the risk of task failure. The study presents the Secure and Fault-Tolerant Strategies (SFTS)-enabled IIoHT framework that optimizes wearable sensor data and executes it with the minimum offloading and processing delays. Simulation results show that the proposed work minimized the security risk by 40%, failure risk of tasks risk by 50%, and the training and testing time by 39% for sensor data during the execution of mobile fog cloud networks.}

The tool is grounded in fundamental premises, including an assessment-driven management approach, integration of organizational theories, integration of sustainability into organizational strategy, incorporation of sustainability into PMM, macro-congruence, micro-congruence, alignment between organizational strategy and PMM, and alignment between technology and PMM. The tool can be used as a comprehensive survey instrument for extensive exploration within the manufacturing sector. However, for in-depth exploration, it is recommended to employ the case study methodology, following the proposed ‘four-stage assessment process'. The research methodology adheres to the PRISMA statement and Jabareen's framework. To the best of our knowledge, a dedicated assessment tool for IoT with a specific focus on sustainable manufacturing is currently unavailable. It's important to mention that the assessment tool was developed primarily through a comprehensive literature review without empirical validation. Consequently, there is a pressing need for refinement and validation, providing an avenue for future investigations to seek expert contributions and insights using the Delphi process. Moreover, subsequent studies may also include rigorous statistical tests, such as assessments of validity and reliability, to enhance the tool's robustness and accuracy.}

The RFE approach selected optimal features using logistic regression (LR) and extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBRegressor) kernel functions. MLP parameters were adjusted by using a hyperparameter optimization and 10-fold cross-validation approach was performed for performance evaluations. The developed model was performed on various IoMT cybersecurity datasets, and attained the best accuracy rates of 99.99%, 99.94%, 98.12%, and 96.2%, using Edith Cowan University- Internet of Health Things (ECU-IoHT), Intensive Care Unit (ICU Dataset), Telemetry data, Operating systems’ data, and Network data from the testbed IoT/IIoT network (TON-IoT), and Washington University in St. Louis enhanced healthcare monitoring system (WUSTL-EHMS) datasets, respectively.

In this study, we develop and solve an integrated problem of procurement, production, and distribution strategies (PPDs) in a medium-scale food processing company. Using the digital twin approach, the model considers the industrial symbiosis opportunities between the supplier, manufacturer, and customer using interval and sequence variables operating in a constrained environment using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and agent-based simulation (ABS) methodology. The study optimizes the make-span and lead time, simultaneously achieving a higher level of digitalization. The analysis demonstrates how digital twin accelerates supply chain productivity by improving makespan time, data redundancy (DR), optimal scheduling plan (OSP), overall operations effectiveness (OOE), overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), and capacity utilization. Our findings provide compelling evidence that the seamless integration PPDs enormously enhance production flexibility, resulting in an excellent service level of 94 %. Managers leverage real-time simulation to accurately estimate the replenishment point with minimal lead time, ensuring optimized operations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that implementing PPDs has yielded considerable benefits. Specifically, we observed a remarkable 65 % utilization of the pasteurizer and aging vessel and an impressive 97 % utilization of the freezer. Moreover, by applying the DT model, the present model found a notable 6 % reduction in backlog, further streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency.}

However, the lack of cybersecurity in CI gave rise to advanced threats and vulnerabilities that hindered the aforementioned societal benefits. In this vein, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of cyber threats and risks associated with different critical infrastructures, such as the financial, agriculture, energy, and healthcare sectors. Further, we thoroughly investigate the staggering benefits of AI and, based on it, present an exhaustive solution taxonomy to showcase the competency of AI mechanisms in confronting cyberattacks on CI. The taxonomy specifically addresses issues like data privacy, algorithmic bias, and human-AI collaboration for CI. Further, we proposed an AI-based secure data exchange framework for smart grid CI, where we attempt to secure the sensor’s data (i.e., power consumption, energy readings, and network data) from malicious adversaries. The proposed framework is evaluated using statistical measures, such as accuracy, training time, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and anomaly detection.

Hence, low cybersecurity protection levels make such ICS interesting for malicious cyber-attackers. Thus, resilience to such attacks through cybersecurity has become one of the most significant concerns of Industry 4.0. While the technical aspects of cybersecurity for manufacturing systems are increasingly researched, there are few published works on effective methods to train cybersecurity for manufacturing systems. This paper proposes a cybersecurity training concept that builds on teaching cybersecurity in an interactive role-based approach within a teaching factory environment. Both attack and defense strategies can be explored, and student learning performance evaluated. The concept has been implemented to show its feasibility and potential to outperform traditional classroom-based training methods.}

The seamless integration of control, communication, and computing operations allow CPPS to be fully monitored and controlled. Threats, vulnerabilities, and catastrophic attacks will intrude as CPPS monitoring, protection, and control functions advance. For the CPPS to operate safely, securely, and efficiently, sustainable cybersecurity solutions must be developed, and the power grid's reliability and resilience must be maintained even when exposed to unfavorable network conditions. While more distributed and renewable energy sources are connected to the grid, cybersecurity helps to ensure the supply of electricity is sustainable and of high quality. The validation of such sustainable cybersecurity analysis goes beyond the traditional power grid network analysis, which means that the test should integrate the physical and cyber system behavior and respond to the network attacks. To analyze the cybersecurity and cyberattacks in the practical CPPS, comprehensive and realistic CPPS testbeds are needed. The heterogeneous nature of the CPPS concept urges multidisciplinary testbeds with various functions and capabilities to evaluate the new cyber-attacks, vulnerabilities, and threats in CPPS. Using this CPPS testbed framework, the different types of cyber-attack can be detected, and detection algorithm can be evaluated, and helps to enhance the development of sustainable cybersecurity defenses for realistic CPPS environment with the increasingly dense integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). This Part-I paper review the CPPS testbeds in the view of the physical power system layer, sensing layer, communication layer, control layer, application layer, test platforms, and research goals with the fusion of cyber and physical systems. In addition, this review presented an overview, structure, and application-based evaluation of existing testbeds from the industry and institutions. The various research areas in CPPS are reviewed first to show the research trends on different aspects of CPPS which have gained significant attention in the past decade. The necessity of testbeds for cyberattacks and sustainable cybersecurity analysis in CPPS are then described. Finally, the NIST framework for CPS, CPPS domains, and research areas are presented.

The Industrial Internet of Water Things (IIoWT) has recently emerged as a leading architecture for efficient water distribution in smart cities. Its primary purpose is to ensure high-quality drinking water for various institutions and households. However, existing IIoWT architecture has many challenges. One of the paramount challenges in achieving data standardization and data fusion across multiple monitoring institutions responsible for assessing water quality and quantity.
Objective:
This paper introduces the Industrial Internet of Water Things System for Data Standardization based on Blockchain and Digital Twin Technology. The main objective of this study is to design a new IIoWT architecture where data standardization, interoperability, and data security among different water institutions must be met.
Methods:
We devise the digital twin-enabled cross-platform environment using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to achieve seamless interoperability in heterogeneous computing. In water management, we encounter different types of data from various sensors. Therefore, we propose a CNN-LSTM and blockchain data transactional (BCDT) scheme for processing valid data across different nodes.
Results:
Through simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed IIoWT architecture significantly reduces processing time while improving the accuracy of data standardization within the water distribution management system.
Conclusion:
Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive approach to tackle the challenges of data standardization and security in the IIoWT architecture.}

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes.

abstract = {In recent years, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced in many areas and landed the approach in top strategic technology trends. However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions. It is a technology-agnostic three-layered model, which reconciles existing understandings of DT under a common umbrella. We also derive an operational architecture as a possible implementation of the framework, which we demonstrate on two use cases. The large adoption of such a framework will draw a clear line between what is a DT and what is not, while establishing a high-level standard model for DT engineering.}

abstract = {As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.}

This research paper addresses the use of Digital Twins in the logistics industry at the network, site, and asset levels. There is no single definition of a Digital Twins framework for logistics twins in academic and industry practice, so a scientific method allows for investigation from an exploratory perspective. Data/fact findings were conducted in two ways: (1) in-depth interviews with experts from academia, ICT organizations, and key players in the logistics industry; (2) academic publications, industry reports, and written and media content from established national and international organizations. This paper proposes a conceptual Digital Twins framework for logistics (DTLs). This paper clarifies DTL concepts and defines an implementation from academic and practical points of view. It thoroughly explores actual use cases of DTLs to validate the concept and optimize its implementation. This paper explains how DTLs work and add value to businesses. In doing so, it outlines different technological requirements for solutions and logistical performance objectives when implementing different levels of DTLs. This paper focuses on Fifth-Party Logistics Providers (5 PLs) due to their complexity and the fact that they are becoming increasingly important and relatively widespread. This paper combines academic and industry perspectives to gain a shared understanding of DTLs as an entire logistics value chain in the case of 5 PLs. It provides a practical reference for researchers and practitioners to facilitate discussion on DTLs.}

The rapid increase of functional needs in Industry 4.0 has indeed exposed them to numerous cyberattacks. Cyberattacks against ICSs or IIoT can cause considerable societal and economic disruption. Cyber resilient and cybersecurity practices are essential to integrate secure networks, control systems, physical processes, and their interconnections toward handling cyberattacks. In this paper, we survey relevant cyber resilience strategies for industrial networks, focusing on ICSs and IIoT. First, we provide a coverage of resilient networks and the fundamental components of ICSs and IIoT. Second, state of the art articles that propose cyber resilience assessment frameworks are reviewed. They are classified according to the resilience aspects they address and the defense mechanism, anomaly detection, failure management and survivability strategy, as well as resilience measure they present. As a result, the main technical and human related challenges, practical limitations, and current cyber resilience needs of industrial networks are identified. Finally, we establish the principal requirements that cyber resilience schemes for industrial networks should meet shortly and suggest promising directions for future research.}

abstract = {A system paradigm is a typical pattern or model of enterprise architectures (EAs) that describes constitutive system elements and their relations in achieving missions and goals of enterprises. A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example. The rationales and significances of DT-II and IoDTT as well as future research directions of DM are summarized as a conclusion.}

Research in this domain has started leading towards more advanced ways of visually interacting with these digital twins, and this could be by means of immersive technologies (such as virtual reality) to better allow farmers to feel a sense of presence when exploring these digital copies. Yet there are many remaining challenges for the technology’s integration and more studies are needed into user interaction; specifically regarding simulation sickness to cater for comfort during prolonged and regular use. Thus, this article documents the survey of 30 participants by means of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (before and after interaction) when using an immersive digital greenhouse twin environment. Findings indicate that users who experience simulation sickness tend to provide a lower evaluation score of the digital twin and their prior experience of gaming (on varied devices) affects the overall evaluation of the digital environment. Further, the level of playability and realism (referred to as convenience), statistically affects the end users’ level of sickness. For tracking crop growth by means of digital greenhouse twins, where prolonged user interaction may take place in a virtual environment, these are notable considerations for digital twin developers.}

The participating devices in an IoT network usually have resource constraints and the devices are prone to different cyber attacks, leading to the loopholes in the security and authentication. As a revolutionized and innovated technology, blockchain, that is applied in cryptocurrency, market prediction, etc., uses a distributed ledger that records transactions securely and efficiently. To utilize the great potential of blockchain, both industries and academia have paid a significant attention to integrate it with the IoT, as reported by several existing literature. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is able to embed intelligence in a system, and thus the AI can be integrated with IoT devices in order to automatically cope with different environments according to the demands. Furthermore, both blockchain and AI can be integrated with the IoT to design an automated secure and robust IoT model, as mentioned by numerous existing works. In this survey, we present a discussion on the IoT, blockchain, and AI, along with the descriptions of several research works that apply blockchain and AI in the IoT. In this direction, we point out strengths and limitations of the related existing researches. We also discuss different open challenges to exploit the full capacities of blockchain and AI in designing an IoT-based model. Therefore, the highlighted challenging issues can open the door for the development of future IoT models which will be intelligent and secure based on the integration of blockchain and AI with the IoT.}

First, we detail how current requirements for digital twins have to be enriched for supporting adaptivity, autonomy, and context-awareness. Second, we propose a set of reusable design patterns mostly popularized in the field of micro-services allowing engineers to meet these new demanding requirements while keeping complexity and management costs under control.

However, machine learning models have recently been vulnerable to carefully crafted perturbations, so-called adversarial attacks. A capable insider adversary can subvert the machine learning model at either the training or testing phase, causing them to behave differently. The vulnerability of machine learning to adversarial attacks becomes one of the significant risks. Therefore, there is a need to secure machine learning models enabling the safe adoption in malicious insider cases. This paper reviews and organizes the body of knowledge in adversarial attacks and defense presented in IoT literature from an insider adversary point of view. We proposed a taxonomy of adversarial methods against machine learning models that an insider can exploit. Under the taxonomy, we discuss how these methods can be applied in real-life IoT applications. Finally, we explore defensive methods against adversarial attacks. We believe this can draw a comprehensive overview of the scattered research works to raise awareness of the existing insider threats landscape and encourages others to safeguard machine learning models against insider threats in the IoT ecosystem.}

abstract = {In modern networking industrial environments, characterized by the integration of Operation Technology and Information Technology, there is a strong need to ensure both safety and security of operations and communications. In this regard, IEC 62443 zones and conduits represent powerful high-level abstractions stressing the importance of clearly separating machines in relation to safety requirements and of clearly defining inter-machine communication security requirements. However, their actual implementation is still demanded to human-centric error-prone procedures performed by technicians directly on network elements, without any integrated plant-wide point of view. To overcome these issues, first of all we originally state the need of applying the Digital Twin approach to zones and conduits, making easier the definition and management of inter-machine security requirements. For instance, industrial technicians can specify that communication among two zones should always flows through a ciphered conduit with a given algorithm and key length, at the cost of increased latency. Secondly, we state the need of exploiting an intelligent reasoner to monitor the current state of the environment (represented by asset and network Digital Twins), actively reconfiguring them in case desired requirements are not satisfied. Then, the reasoner allows to enforce requirements while also considering the fulfillment of a proper trade-off between security and performance, e.g., by reducing the ciphering complexity to ensure prompt packet dispatching whenever required. Performance results based on our working prototype demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution under stringent requirements typical of industrial environments. In particular, in terms of better flexibility we proved that our orchestrator is able to create a new Digital Twin in less than 2.5 s in a typical edge node with a medium load. In addition, proposed routing policies based on our machine learning reasoner led to the satisfaction of well-defined low latency requirements (250 ms) while avoiding packet dropping.}

The Digital Twin (DT) can virtualize and learn the data of the physical space, and introduce DT into the crowdsourcing logistics. It can iteratively update the crowdsourcing logistics participant strategy by constructing a virtual space, so as to change the corresponding strategy in time. Considering the situation of crowdsourcing logistics workers signing contracts with platforms and colluding with platforms, this paper constructs a four-party evolutionary game model of temporary workers, contract workers, blockchain-based crowdsourcing platforms and task requester, and analyzes the evolution using replication dynamics method stabilization strategy. In the virtual scene of DT, multi-agent reinforcement learning is used to predict the evolution result of the current strategy, and a reward and punishment strategy is given to prevent workers from free-riding and platform false reporting. The simulation results show that the analyzed evolutionary stability strategy can make the crowdsourcing logistics system run continuously and healthily, and the participants can adjust the strategy correctly according to the prediction results of virtual crowdsourcing logistics.}

This review evaluates how lean principles can support Industry 4.0 in pursuit of greater customer value and manufacturing excellence. Leveraging the opportunities that exist within Industry 4.0 umbrella of technologies can help to further reduce the nine wastes of lean. While large corporations have access to extensive capital markets and can capture economies of scale offered by leading edge technologies of Industry 4.0, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with greater capital restraints face the challenge of justifying Industry 4.0 technologies and cannot risk being at the bleeding edge of technology. Using a case study of a small electronics manufacturing firm, the opportunities, challenges, and the implementation strategy for technology are examined. This paper finds that SMEs pursuit of process efficiencies and waste reduction can be best achieved through a focus on foundational digitalization & data management then taking a stepwise approach towards the cyber-physical systems of Industry 4.0.}

This paper presents an inductive study of the “why” and “how” of BC-IoT systems through a Systematic Literature Review of 120 peer-reviewed studies. To capture the diverse nature of BC-IoT integration, we proposed and applied a multi-perspective framework to analyse the existing systems. Regarding their motivations, we studied the improvement objectives and technical problems that drive the integration of BC. Regarding the design, we captured the position of BC within IoT systems as well as the content and processes that IoT systems offload to BC. As these dimensions are not mutually exclusive, they constitute a rich and multi-angle view of BC-IoT integration. Based on these findings, we defined 10 archetypes of BC-IoT systems that embody the core patterns of usage and configuration of BC in IoT systems.}

The common application strategy for the applications of DT in the O&M stage of the AEC industry has not yet been fully understood. So many fresh researchers who want to apply DT to new problems in the field are not clear which technologies should be used and how to organise them together. In this regard, the optional enabling technologies are given based on a bibliometric search, and a complete common strategy for DT application in the O&M stage of the AEC industry is established, which supplements the theory of the AEC field. Meanwhile, the existing gaps and research opportunities at the technical level are secondly identified. To achieve this goal, there are 825 publications related to DT applications in the AEC industry O&M stage are analysed, published between 2016.1.1 and 2023.7.28. The digital twin enabling techniques are summarised from four aspects in the paper. Firstly, the common technologies used in different current research topics are concluded and analysed in the review. Then, the enabling technologies for digital twin are concluded systematically from the perspective of the digital twin five-dimensional model. Thirdly, integrating technologies commonly used for each component based on widely recognised strategies for digital twin applications, a digital twin application technology strategy is finalised for the AEC industry O&M stage. Finally, the future work is concluded at the end of the article.}

These data often contain significant levels of heterogeneity and privacy in accordance with the various requirements of industrial applications, therefore controlling for these data in an intelligent and secure way is still an outstanding problem. Federated edge learning (FEEL), a distributed machine learning paradigm, has become a viable option for developing learning models while maintaining data privacy. In this paper, we concentrate on a semi-decentralized FEEL (SD-FEEL) framework, taking into account the limited training data in a single central cluster, where the shared edge models is trained among devices and edge servers. An edge aggregation optimization problem with joint device association, resource block allocation, and edge server placement is then formulated based on the evaluated upper bound of the convergence performance for SD-FEEL, with the goal of minimizing the training loss while taking into account the cost budget of edge servers. Based on the calculation of training loss degradation, the proposed optimization issue can be transformed into a dynamic optimum problem. A Trilateral Matching-based association (TMA) method is then proposed to discover solutions to the sub-problems of device association and resource block allocation. Additionally, a Tabu Search-based Service location (TSP) method is suggested to optimize the placement of the edge servers. To fully address the optimization problem, a combination iterative approach including the TMA and TSP is proposed. According to simulation data, the proposed algorithm can greatly beat the baselines in terms of test accuracy with limited cost budget.}

With access to data from multiple sources, manufacturers can provide on-demand and customised products. However, existing research of smart customisation has focused on data generated from the physical world, not virtual models. As physical data is constrained by what has already occurred, it is limited in the identification of new areas to improve customer satisfaction. A new technology called digital twin aims to achieve this integration of physical and virtual entities. Incorporation of digital twin into the paradigm of existing data-driven smart customisation will make the process more responsive, adaptable and predictive. This paper presents a new framework of data-driven smart customisation augmented by digital twin. The new framework aims to facilitate improved collaboration of all stakeholders in the customisation process.

abstract = {To ensure the safe operation of industrial digital twins network and avoid the harm to the system caused by hacker invasion, a series of discussions on network security issues are carried out based on game theory. From the perspective of the life cycle of network vulnerabilities, mining and repairing vulnerabilities are analyzed by applying evolutionary game theory. The evolution process of knowledge sharing among white hats under various conditions is simulated, and a game model of the vulnerability patch cooperative development strategy among manufacturers is constructed. On this basis, the differential evolution is introduced into the update mechanism of the Wolf Colony Algorithm (WCA) to produce better replacement individuals with greater probability from the perspective of both attack and defense. Through the simulation experiment, it is found that the convergence speed of the probability (X) of white Hat 1 choosing the knowledge sharing policy is related to the probability (x0) of white Hat 2 choosing the knowledge sharing policy initially, and the probability (y0) of white hat 2 choosing the knowledge sharing policy initially. When y0 = 0.9, X converges rapidly in a relatively short time. When y0 is constant and x0 is small, the probability curve of the “cooperative development” strategy converges to 0. It is concluded that the higher the trust among the white hat members in the temporary team, the stronger their willingness to share knowledge, which is conducive to the mining of loopholes in the system. The greater the probability of a hacker attacking the vulnerability before it is fully disclosed, the lower the willingness of manufacturers to choose the "cooperative development" of vulnerability patches. Applying the improved wolf colony-co-evolution algorithm can obtain the equilibrium solution of the "attack and defense game model", and allocate the security protection resources according to the importance of nodes. This study can provide an effective solution to protect the network security for digital twins in the industry.}

The anticipated growth of smart devices, 5G, edge computing, and artificial intelligence promises to create even more data, connected nodes, and expanded attack surfaces. Despite making significant investments in security organizations continue to struggle with security breaches. It is highly challenging to analyze the data that is flowing into the security operation centers.

However, despite the recent increase of research on UDTs due to its widespread diffusion much more recently, there is a lack of studies examining the existing bottlenecks to its implementation. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic literature review on the key challenges and open issues pertaining to the implementation of an UDT. Results indicate 8 important categories of challenges related to (1) interoperability and semantics; (2) infrastructure, including storage, computation, network; (3) data acquisition and actuation; (4) data quality and harmonization; (5) modeling, simulation and decision-support; (6) data visualization and information display; (7) human and capital resources; and finally (8) governance, organizational and social issues. All topics are significantly raised in the literature, with most emphasis on issues pertaining to data and model semantics, missing data, data quality and modeling. The findings serve to inform practitioners about the bottlenecks delaying the implementation of UDTs.}

Despite the presence of several sensor units, the transmission of precise data to multiple data units is hindered by an increase in time intervals. Therefore, the suggested methodology is specifically developed for the purpose of generating digital replicas for aeronautical applications, wherein an aero transfer function is correlated with the digital twins. Mapping functions are utilized in the monitoring of diverse parameters that are associated with the identification of objects inside data transmission networks, with the aim of minimizing uncertainty. The suggested system model is enhanced by incorporating analytical representations and deep learning methods, resulting in the provision of zero point twin functionalities. The present study investigates the aforementioned integrated procedure through the analysis of four different situations. In these settings, an aero communication tool box is employed to transform the device configuration into simulation outputs. The results obtained from the comparison of these scenarios reveal that the projected model significantly enhances the maintenance period while minimizing data errors.}

However, LoRa-enabled IIoT networks are susceptible to cyberattacks mainly due to their wide transmission window and freely operated frequency band. This has led to several categories of cyberattacks. However, existing anomaly detection systems are inefficient in detecting particularly impersonation attacks due to the dense deployment, heterogeneous IIoT devices and manufacturers involved. In this work, we introduce Hawk, a distributed anomaly detection system for detecting compromised devices in LoRa-enabled IIoT. Hawk first measures a device-type specific physical layer feature, Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and then leverages the CFO for fingerprinting the device, and consequently detecting anomalous deviations in the device’s CFO behavior, potentially caused by adversaries. To aggregate the device-type specific CFO behavior profile efficiently, Hawk uses federated learning, a distributed machine learning approach. To the best of our knowledge, Hawk is the first to utilise a federated learning method for anomaly-based intrusion detection in LoRa-enabled IIoT. We perform extensive experiments on a real-world dataset collected using 60 LoRa devices, primarily to assess the effectiveness of Hawk against emerging new and unknown attacks. The results show that Hawk improves the detection accuracy by more than 8% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Additionally, Hawk reduces the storage overhead by more than 40%, and exhibits significant robustness against cyberattack.}

This article presents the latest advancements in each stage of TCM systems, namely fusion sensors methods, modern data acquisition systems (DAQ), virtual machining, and lightweight TCM models, wherein artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies demonstrate promising operational efficiency and accuracy while showing their potential in practical applications. Moreover, emphasis is paid to the current blank spots and limitations of implementing machine learning, deep learning, and IoT technologies in tool-embedded TCM, namely big data handling, generalization of Machine Learning models, as well as cloud computing latency, which suggests corresponding solutions to enable the practicality of mass implementation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for TCM systems, such as cloud migration, custom TCM network, and shared knowledge databases between multiple factories. In addition to a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art innovations for TCM systems, the future prospects of intelligent TCM systems are also presented for smart manufacturing.}

The number of articles published is large and continues to increase, introducing new issues, concepts, methods, and technologies. Many review articles deal with specific issues and not always with the necessary rigor, making a more general understanding of the subject difficult. Motivated by the large volume of literature, this study makes a tertiary review of Industry 4.0 (i4.0), identifying the main concepts, methods, and technologies. The study is guided by three research questions: What are the literature reviews on i4.0? What are the research questions of these reviews? What are the main results of i4.0 reviews? The reviewed articles are systematic review articles indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. This study presents a descriptive analysis of the review articles (46 articles) and a second descriptive analysis of the references cited in them (1542 articles). In content analysis, we grouped the articles into three classes: conceptual articles, articles on enabling technologies, and articles that address operations management in i4.0. The reviewed articles show the multidisciplinary nature of the topic and the still relative scarcity of studies on its application in companies.}

abstract = {5G core network slicing is an important component of 5G end-to-end slicing, which divides the physical network into multiple logical networks to handle various critical service flows, and brings better cost effectiveness to operators. Due to the variety of services and the limited resources of the core network, slice admission control is particularly important, which can selectively accept or reject the slice request, so as to maximize the operators’ revenue. However, existing works mainly focus on the complete acceptance or rejection of the slice request, and rarely consider the partial admission. In fact, there exists the best-effort slice in the network, which requires relaxed service performance and its resources can be appropriately adjusted. In view of this, we consider partial admission of slice requests under limited resources, introduce slice scaling factor to characterize the resource adjustment threshold, and propose a flexible slice admission control (FSAC) scheme for 5G core network based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the goal of improving slice deployment revenue. In order to avoid the negative impact on real physical network caused by DRL agent’s policy exploration, we also design a digital twin-assisted slice admission control framework. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving slice deployment revenue and acceptance ratio.}

abstract = {The transformation of dynamic supply chains within the realm of offsite manufacturing presents a unique and compelling opportunity to effectively respond to shifts in market demand. However, this paradigm shift also entails novel challenges and prospects for streamlining processes, augmenting efficiency, and ultimately driving success across production workflows and logistical operations. Dynamic supply chains necessitate unimpeded access to high-quality, dependable data to facilitate real-time, data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, owing to their inherently intricate nature, these supply chains are subject to a heightened vulnerability to disruptions and delays, surpassing those encountered in traditional supply chains. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a framework that synthesises the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), and blockchain technology (BCT) into a cohesive and integrated system, thereby optimising the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management operations. The proposed framework takes cognisance of the challenges inherent in ensuring information traceability, mitigating fragmented information, enhancing interoperability, and fortifying reliability throughout the design, production, and implementation phases of assets within dynamic supply chains operating in the offsite manufacturing domain. To illustrate the efficacy of our proposition, we present a framework that exemplifies the seamless integration of a permissioned, open-source distributed ledger, which forms the bedrock of our support infrastructure for IoT and BIM integration. Through rigorous analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of the developed framework in the form of a designed Supply Chain Management Model (SCMM-PDO), which harmonises the physical, digital, and operational layers within a robust system architecture (BCT.IoT-BIM). The integration of these technologies provides a decentralised solution, reinforcing supply chains with improved security, reliability, and quality control mechanisms, thus enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain network. It is anticipated that this transformative integration will yield substantial improvements in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as operational efficiency, cost reduction, and the cultivation of trust and accountability across supply chain activities. The research proposes an IoT and BIM conceptual framework that simulates the dynamic supply chain operations, facilitating real-time analysis and prediction of supply chain participants' behaviours from resources, processes, and assets. Furthermore, the integration of IoT-BIM (digital twinning) with a blockchain-based system, such as Hyperledger Fabric, engenders a secure and transparent framework for the diligent tracking of assets and information throughout the supply chain. The findings of this study offer an all-encompassing conceptual framework for the secure and transparent tracking of asset information by integrating Blockchain-based technologies with IoT and BIM. This research endeavour thus expands the existing body of knowledge, establishing a foundation for future investigations within this proliferating field.}

Consequently, big data-driven product design focuses mostly on physical data analysis instead of virtual models; in other words, there is no frequent convergence between a product’s virtual and physical space. Recently, the interest in developing a digital twin, which interconnects the real and virtual world, has grown rapidly throughout the world. As Industry 4.0 hypes the power of artificial intelligence embedded into “things,” it neglects the role of the human component, which is still essential in many manufacturing activities, such as machine setup or maintenance. A digital twin of service-oriented manufacturing knowledge was developed, which leverages a flexible ontology-based knowledge structure combined with an augmented reality input system for intuitive, hands-on knowledge retrieval. The autonomous and self-optimizing characteristics of intelligent manufacturing suggest new demands, including learning and cognitive capabilities. Intelligent manufacturing offers enhanced quality, high productivity, low costs, and great flexibility for manufacturers. Intelligent manufacturing utilizes digital twins to monitor the status of their systems in real time and predict failures before they happen. In this chapter, the main focus is on reviewing and discussing the existing literature to convey the concept, operation, and application of digital twin manufacturing.}

HDTs are digital representations of humans, aiming to change the practice of human-system integration by coupling humans’ characteristics directly to the system design and its performance. In-depth analysis, critical insights, and application guidelines of HDT are essential to realize the concept of Industry 5.0 in practice and evolve the smart manufacturing paradigm in modern factories. However, the investigation on the development of HDT to evolve humans’ roles and develop humans to their full potential is limited to date. Recent studies are rarely geared towards designing a standardized framework and architecture of HDT for diverse real-world applications. Thus, this work aims to close this research gap by carrying out a comprehensive survey on HDT in the context of Industry 5.0, summarizing the ongoing evolution, and proposing a proper connotation of HDT, before discussing the conceptual framework and system architecture of HDT and analyzing enabling technologies and industrial applications. This work provides guidance on possible avenues as well as challenges for the further development of HDT and its related concepts, allowing humans to reach their potential and accommodating their diverse needs in the futuristic smart manufacturing systems shaped by Industry 5.0.}

Current methods and data infrastructures for industrial energy savings were comprehensively reviewed to showcase the potential for a more accurate and effective digital twin-based infrastructure for the industry. With a few more development in enabling technologies such as 5G developments, Internet of Things (IoT) standardization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain 3.0 utilization, it is but a matter of time that the industry will transition towards the digital twin-based approach. Global government efforts and policies are already inclining towards leveraging better industrial energy efficiencies and energy savings. This provides a promising future for the development of a digital twin-based energy-saving system in the industry.

The use of real-time information systems in logistics operations generates an enormous amount of data, nowadays used mainly for the purpose of monitoring and control of large flows of goods. At the same time, urban planners, business stakeholders, and city administrators are in need of adaptive, data-driven decision support solutions to address today's urban logistics problems. Recently, digital twins have received a lot of attention to support advanced experimentation, simulation and decision-making for on-demand logistics operations. Questions still remain on how to realize these for urban logistics management in a mixed public-private stakeholder context. We argue that this lack of a specific framework for city logistics with a model library for data mergers, linking physical and virtual data exchange, can compromise the timely adoption of digital twin technology. We contribute to filling this gap by presenting a systematic review of the literature, proposing a conceptual framework for digital twin applications in urban logistics, and providing use case scenarios for their demonstration. Together, these should advance the technical implementation of digital twins in a sustainable city logistics context.}

As typical IIoT systems, industrial robots are suffering from lots of threats involving control, communication, and computing, which are difficult to detect IIoT attacks accurately in real-time due to resource constraints. How to efficiently and accurately identify IoT attacks on industrial robots is challenging. To address this, we propose a trustworthy security model (TSM) with a fusion design that integrates an improved deep Q-network (IDQN) and a control model, thus accelerating the model training process by reducing the network traversal space and improving detection accuracy by establishing a prejudgment mechanism. We initially provide a detailed overview of existing methods for robot security and derive a robot control model consisting of kinematics and kinetic. Then, a 17-labeled dataset named iRobot security dataset is established to train the TSM. Moreover, we established a robot physical platform to evaluate the performance of TSM, and five cyber security indicators are employed to quantify the performance. Experimental results show that TSM detects attacks at an average rate of 98.7 % and a 0.01 s latency, which demonstrates the excellent performance in detection accuracy and detection efficiency, and provides an idea for solving these issues.}

In this article, we introduce a novel security framework that centres on deep learning and is tailored to support the particular risks posed by IoT channels and 5G networks. Deep neural networks are used in our proposed framework to effectively analyze network activity patterns and recognize any possible breaches in real-time communication. Deep learning autonomously learns complicated features and patterns, facilitating the proposed model's adaptability to changing threat vectors and traffic features. This research proposed a Hybrid model using enhanced light-weight CNNs architecture (MobileNetV3-SVM) and Transfer learning (TL) for intrusion detection in 5G communication. The proposed model utilizes the advantages of a multi-layered structure, which enables it to acquire knowledge from raw network information hierarchically. It provides the ability to distinguish between authentic and malicious behaviour efficiently. We have implemented several cutting-edge strategies to maximize the effectiveness of intrusion detection in environments characterized by limited availability of resources, such as those associated with the IoT and high-speed 5G networks. The proposed hybrid model processes network packets in real-time using light-weight MobileNet, reducing the computational overhead and making it suitable for IoT and 5G edge devices. In the proposed model, a MobileNetV3-SVM auto-classifies the network's intrusion images, enhancing the overall accuracy. In addition, to address the issue of limited labelled data in dynamic and constantly changing systems, we use a transfer learning strategy to deal with this issue. The proposed hybrid model and existing CNN- architectures, i.e., VGG-16, VGG-19, Efficient-Net and Inception-Net, are tested on CICIDS-2017, 2018 and UNSW-NB15 IoT 5G security datasets. During the experimental assessment, we demonstrated the strength of the proposed model by simulating a wide range of network settings and intrusion scenarios. Experimental findings show considerable improvements by the proposed hybrid model in accuracy, precision, false positive rates, Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and AUC-ROC over existing approaches.}

We followed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies, which begins with an extensive literature review to establish a theoretical foundation & identify key concepts. The qualitative component involves in-depth interviews with experts the responses evaluated through ISM-MICMAC-DEMATEL analysis with Python programming. The findings are three folds; first, we explored the enablers of DT and LSS approaches and provided a comprehensive analysis on literature. Secondly, we prioritized the DT enablers for LSS practitioners by providing prominence casual values. It suggests that, among the identified enablers, real-time simulation was the most significant reason for DT implementation in LSS practices, followed by edge computing and Interoperability Standards. Additionally, results will help policymakers to faster DT implementation, ensuring LSS practices. This study explored the fact of limited attention on DTs-LSS in previous studies.

abstract = {In the Oil and Gas industry, minor accidents can negatively affect people, the environment, and the enterprise on a grand scale. For this type of business, it is crucial to have adequate monitoring and maintenance operational routines. The concept of digital twins has been widely discussed as an industrial solution capable of monitoring objects in real-time, predicting their state, integrity, and safety conditions, and providing user feedback. This analysis can also perform predictive maintenance and estimate efficiency levels. This paper follows a systematic approach and inspects the current state of digital twin adoption by the Oil and Gas industry, along with cloud and edge utilization in both scenarios. The survey was conducted by filtering and selecting articles published in three different queries regarding digital twins in the Oil and Gas industry, cloud and edge usage in digital twins, and cloud and edge usage in the Oil and Gas industry. The selected articles were classified and reviewed to present an overview of the current literature regarding digital twins in the oil and gas industry and evaluate cloud-based solutions for digital twins in this context. This review found that cloud and edge adoption in the Oil and Gas industry was late compared to other industries, mainly because of security and data privacy concerns. Digital twin adoption across all industries is still in its infancy, as most of the current works are theoretical or present partial implementations, which often follow different digital twin definitions. Cloud and edge computing grant access to increased storage and computational capabilities and decouple the necessity of relying on a robust local IT infrastructure, being critical enabling factors for digital twin implementation.}

abstract = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time monitoring, simulation, optimisation and accurate forecasting. However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions, and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice of DT and its allied technologies.}

Often, sensory equipment cannot capture all relevant information easily or at all. Digital Twins close this gap with virtual probes in real-time simulations, synchronized with the process. This paper proposes a physics-based, data-driven Digital Twin framework for autonomous food processing. We suggest a lean Digital Twin concept that is executable at the device level, entailing minimal computational load, data storage, and sensor data requirements. This study focuses on a parsimonious experimental design for training non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) of a thermal process. A correlation (R =  − 0.76) between a high standard deviation of the surface temperatures in the training data and a low root mean square error in ROM testing enables efficient selection of training data. The mean test root mean square error of the best ROM is less than 1 Kelvin (0.2% mean average percentage error) on representative test sets. Simulation speed-ups of Sp ≈ 1.8 × 104 allow on-device model predictive control.
Industrial relevance
The proposed Digital Twin framework is designed to be applicable within the industry. Typically, non-intrusive reduced-order modeling is required as soon as the modeling of the process is performed in software, where root-level access to the solver is not provided, such as commercial simulation software. The data-driven training of the reduced-order model is achieved with only one data set, as correlations are utilized to predict the training success a priori.}

Due to the advancement of I-4.0, researchers worldwide have been investigating whether there is any complementary effect of Lean and I-4.0 on operational performance, developing a strategic framework to integrate both paradigms successfully. In this context, this study was conducted using a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to review the synergistic relationship between Lean and I-4.0, their integration framework, and the critical factors behind the sustainability of that integration. This study reviewed 41 journal articles and conference proceedings that met the SLR criteria. These articles were available in ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, and Emerald Insight databases and were published between 2011 and 2022. The number of publications from 2019 to 2022 follows an upward tendency, referring to an emerging research field of integrating I-4.0 into the LP system. The primary contribution of this study is investigating the relationship and integration framework of Lean and I-4.0 and the successful driving factors of integrating I-4.0 into the LP system.}

This shift towards digitalization involves the manufacturing system and allows for a shift towards a digitalized, interconnected, and integrated manufacturing process. Smart manufacturing is the application of Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing field, allowing the use of pillar technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Big Data, 3D Printing, Simulation and Robotics to improve the flexibility, efficiency, and customization of manufacturing processes in the smart factory. This results to the rise of the smart factories, which are capable of meeting dynamic customer demands with high variability in small lot sizes while incorporating human ingenuity and automation. To support the manufacturing industry in this transitioning phase and enhance global competitiveness, policy makers in several countries have established research and technology transfer schemes. Most prominently, Germany introduced its Industrie 4.0 program, which is increasingly affecting European manufacturing policy, while the United States focuses on smart manufacturing, which is defined as fully integrated, collaborative manufacturing systems that respond in real time to changing demands and conditions in the smart factory, supply network, and customer requirements. Furthermore, CPS enabled new services that have the potential to replace traditional business models based solely on product sales. The goal of this chapter is to present an overview of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing business models, to analyze the key enabling technologies in smart factories as well as to present current and future research issues towards Industry 5.0.}

Based on 5Gcommunication, the deep learning (DL) algorithm is introduced to construct the UAV Digital Twins (DTs) communication channel model based on DL. The Coordinated Multi-point Transmission (COMP) technology is adopted to study the interference suppression of UAVs. The key algorithm in the physical layer security is employed to ensure information communication security. Finally, the model constructed is simulated and analyzed. The transmission error rates and transmission estimation accuracy of several algorithms, including the proposed algorithm and ordinary Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), are compared under different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Results find that the convergence speed and convergence effect of the proposed algorithm has prominent advantages, presenting strong robustness; the proposed algorithm's estimation accuracy is about 150 times higher than the traditional algorithms. Further analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm's accuracy reaches 82.39%, which increases by at least 3.2% than other classic machine algorithms. The indicators of Precision, Recall, and F1 are compared as well. Apparently, the Precision, Recall, and F1 values of the proposed algorithm are the highest, while the transmission delay is the smallest. Therefore, the constructed UAV DTs wireless communication channel model has strong robustness and further reduces UAV limitations, providing a reference for improving UAV system performance in the later stage.}

Predictive maintenance using the IoT in smart factories can also be used to prevent machine failures, reduce downtime, and extend the lifespan of equipment. To monitor and optimize energy usage during part manufacturing, manufacturers can obtain real-time insights into energy consumption patterns by deploying IoT sensors in smart factories. Also, IoT can provide a more comprehensive view of the factory environment to enhance workplace safety by identifying potential hazards and alerting workers to potential dangers. Suppliers can use IoT-enabled tracking devices to monitor shipments and provide real-time updates on delivery times and locations in order to analyze and optimize the supply chain in smart factories. Moreover, IoT is a powerful technology which can optimize inventory management in smart factories to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and provide real-time visibility into inventory levels and movements. To analyze and enhance the impact of internet of thing in smart factories of industry 4.0, a review is presented. Applications of internet of things in smart factories such as predictive maintenance, asset tracking, inventory management, quality control, production process monitoring, energy efficiency and supply chain optimization are reviewed.

abstract = {In crowdsourcing systems, a challenge arises in efficiently recruiting workers with unknown execution speed to complete tasks with precedence constraints within the shortest possible time. Recent research either only studies recruiting unknown workers or focuses on assigning tasks with precedence constraints, but few works consider both these factors. This paper aims to address this challenge considering all these factors by proposing a digital twin-assisted Combinatorial Multi-arm bandit based multi-round work Recruitment and task Scheduling (CMRS) scheme. Firstly, with the help of digital twin technology, we build digital twin models for crowdsourcing tasks and workers in digital twin layer of platform. And we formulate a Multi-round Workers recruitment and Task scheduling with Precedence constraints (MWTP) problem with the object of minimizing task completion time (makespan) to model the above challenging issue in crowdsourcing computing. The MWTP problem can be divided into two sub-problems, the task scheduling sub-problem and the worker recruitment sub-problem. Secondly, in the CMRS scheme, the differential evolution based task scheduling (DETS) algorithm and CUCB-based worker recruitment (CWR) method are proposed to solve them, respectively. Specifically, for the task scheduling sub-problem, we first propose a priority-driven based task scheduling (PDTS) approximation algorithm to produce a primary solution with an explicit approximation ratio. Then a DETS algorithm is proposed to use the solution of PDTS for initialization and generate a better solution that further improves the performance. For the unknown workers recruitment sub-problem, we use the Combinatorial Multi-Arm Bandit framework to model this, and propose CWR method to learn the computational capabilities of workers while maintaining good performance during multiple rounds of worker recruitment by adding a tuning term to balanced exploration and exploitation. Finally, verified by extensive comparison experiments, the CMRS scheme can achieve the best performance of makespan compared with the baselines in most cases.}

With the evolution of Industry 4.0, the integration of digital informatics and decisions is crucial for smart manufacturing, Logistics 4.0, and supply chain digitization. However, much of digital content lacks interconnection. As such, the Digital Twin (DT) was proposed to promote the integration of physical machines and devices with the digital space. Augmented reality (AR) usually works in conjunction with the DT network to collect and provide real-time data. In fact, most of the AR devices are not fully connected in DT as the decision support from AI is disconnected. On the other hand, human-machines and object interactions are still complicated in AR, thus limiting applications. In order to achieve digital twinning for object recognition and human-machine interaction, we proposed a DT architecture for integrating the latest Mixed Reality (MR) device for real-time data streaming. Object recognition is empowered by the AI algorithm in the backend cloud computing and database. The entire system integrates the informatics between physical machines and devices and the digital content using an AI algorithm. Our proposed method achieved real-time informatics integration of MR and AI, while the warehouse is used as a case scenario with simulations. Industrial informatics integration can be applied for smart manufacturing, smart warehouse, and many Industry 4.0 applications.}

The method employs an abstract model called Tiny Twin, which is built at design time and is used at runtime to detect inconsistencies. Tiny Twin is a state transition system that represents the observable behavior of the system from the monitor point of view. We model the behavior of the system in the Rebeca modeling language and use Afra model checker to generate the state space. The Tiny Twin is built automatically, by abstracting the state space while keeping the observable actions and preserving the trace equivalence. For doing that we had to solve the complexities in the state space introduced by time-shifts, nondeterministic assignments and abstraction of internal actions. We formally define the state space as Concise Rebeca Timed Transition System (CRTTS), and then map CRTTS to an LTS. The LTS is then fed to a tool to abstract away the non-observable actions.}

IoT may allow reduced human intervention in decision-making processes through controlling, optimizing, planning, and monitoring of the supply chain virtually. This chapter provides an overview of IoT and investigates IoT applications and challenges in the context of supply chains. Different IoT technologies are being actively trialed in a wide range of supply chain applications including cold chains, perishable products, agriculture and crops, and some manufacturing supply chains. However, the application of IoT technologies in supply chains is challenging. Security and data privacy, standards and naming services, technology adoption, and big data generation are some of the critical issues. We present a framework—the IoT Adopter—for organizations to critically assess IoT adoption and implementation in supply chain applications. The framework identifies four fundamental stages that should be considered in deploying IoT across a supply chain: adoption rate calculation, profitability computation, architecture design, and continuous improvement.}

The data gathered typically describe the operating state of the equipment, such as a machine tool, and can be provided using standard protocols. One such protocol, known as MTConnect, is becoming increasingly popular to collect data from machine tools. Other useful data can be collected from production personnel using a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to monitor process output, consumable usage, and operator productivity. However, MTConnect data and MES data usually reside in separate systems that may be proprietary and expensive. This paper describes the development and implementation of a new MES, powered by Android devices and cloud computing tools, that combines MTConnect data with production data collected from operators; the proposed MES is particularly suitable for small manufacturing enterprises, as it is low-cost and easily implementable. A case study using the MES to track a production run of titanium parts is presented, and data from the MES are correlated with MTConnect data from a machine tool. This work is integral to realizing a complete digital model of the shop floor, known as the Shop Floor Digital Twin, that can be used for production control and optimization.}

This article reviews the literature and patents in four closely related fields and aims to provide a holistic view of how they are related and their integrability in relation to smart energy management strategies. Artificial intelligence models forecast energy use and load profiles as well as schedule resources to ensure reliable performance and effective utilization of energy resources. Training artificial intelligence models requires immense volumes of data. Utilizing big data systems and data mining enables the discovery of new functions and relationships, which determines the performance of artificial intelligence. Data mining also refines the information; thus, artificial intelligence is trained iteratively with more accurate data. Smart energy management can be further enhanced through advanced digital technologies like Internet of Things and blockchain. An Internet of Things platform containing edge, fog and cloud layers helps connect artificial intelligence to other hardware and software devices and systems. Furthermore, an Internet of Things platform efficiently transmits and stores data, improving access and availability to stakeholders for data mining. Emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency facilitate energy trading and can be designed in the cloud layer of an Internet of Things platform to supplement data storage.

Nevertheless, the increased connectivity in terms of both wired and wireless links and associated attack surfaces that comes along, requires higher security for safeguarding critical industrial systems and manufacturing lines from cyberattacks. In this rapidly evolving ecosystem, security testbeds have emerged as a versatile, cost-effective solution for investigating potential attack vectors and devising appropriate countermeasures, without putting the real system at risk. The present work seeks to address a prominent literature gap, namely, the lack of a systematic review regarding the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS. We contribute an overarching, manifold review on this topic from 2016 onward, examining the various literature works from diverse angles, namely, the wireless technologies used, the implemented attacks, the employed security controls, and more. The analysis is done on a per-sector basis, including water and wastewater systems, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, energy, maritime, unmanned aircraft systems, and others. Finally yet importantly, we discuss key takeaways, open issues, and challenges. The key observations of our analysis, including almost 50 articles, can be wrapped up into two salient points: on the one hand, wireless technologies are increasingly penetrating into the CPS domain as an orthogonal, versatile solution to their wired counterparts, but on the other, they widen the window of opportunity for threat actors targeting wireless links. In this context, testbed thoroughness and security as a trade-off seem to be of major importance, alongside a modular, possibly sector-neutral reference architecture that overarches the peculiarities of CPS. Overall, to our knowledge, this work provides the first full-fledged survey on the use of wireless-oriented security testbeds in CPS, and it is therefore anticipated to serve as a groundwork and touchstone for several stakeholders at different levels.}

Comprehensive simulation platforms can be presented using digital twins to simulate and evaluate product performances in terms of analysis and modification of produced parts. Commissioning time of a factory can also be significantly reduced by developing and optimizing the factory layout using the digital twin. Also, the productivity of part manufacturing can be enhanced by providing the predictive maintenance and data-driven root-cause analysis during part production process. In this paper, application of digital twin in smart manufacturing systems is reviewed to analyze and discuss the advantages and challenges of part production modification using the digital twin. So, the research field can advance by reading and evaluating previous papers in order to propose fresh concepts and approaches by using digital twins in smart manufacturing systems.}

abstract = {Now a day's manufacturing has become more intelligent and data-driven. A smart production unit can be thought of as a powerful connected industrial system with materials, parts, equipment, tools, inventory, and logistics that can transmit data and communicate with one another in the age of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This IIoT refers to linked devices, sensors, and other equipment that may be networked in the industrial environment to provide remote access, effective monitoring, better data collecting, analysis, & exchange etc. In Industry 4.0, IIoT is fundamental to transforming cyber-physical systems and production processes through big data and analytics. This paper provides an overview of the IIoT and the technologies that underpin it. The primary benefits and features of IIoT in manufacturing are discussed in detail. Smart Transformations made into the manufacturing field through IIoT Culture are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, twenty-nine significant applications of IIoT in the field of manufacturing are identified and discussed. IIoT can monitor the transport, supply of the goods, consult details on things in warehouses, and check the conditions related to product storage and delivery and allow all dispersed and outsourced operations to be monitored. Therefore, the industry is being revolutionised by IIoT, altering the way industrial enterprises function daily to improve efficiency and performance levels.}

abstract = {Combining the metaverse and the Internet of Things (IoT) will lead to the development of diverse, virtual, and more advanced networks in the future. The integration of IoT networks with the metaverse will enable more meaningful connections between the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds, allowing for real-time data analysis, access, and processing. However, these metaverse-IoT networks will face numerous security and privacy threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer an effective means of early detection for such attacks. Nevertheless, the metaverse generates substantial volumes of data due to its interactive nature and the multitude of user interactions within virtual environments, posing a computational challenge for building an intrusion detection system. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection system model based on deep learning. This model aims to detect most attacks targeting metaverse-IoT communications and combines two techniques: KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis which was used for attack feature extraction and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks for attack recognition and classification. The efficiency of this proposed IDS model is assessed using two widely recognized benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT, which contain various IoT attacks potentially targeting IoT communications. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed IDS model in identifying 12 classes of attacks relevant to metaverse-IoT, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.8% and a False Negative Rate FNR less than 0.2. Furthermore, when compared with other models in the literature, our IDS model demonstrates superior performance in attack detection accuracy.}
