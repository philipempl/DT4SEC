Also, how the next-generation data analytics can be smartly accomplished through cloud platforms and infrastructures is also explained in detail. We are to describe some of the impactful developments and technological advancements brewing in the IT space, how the tremendous amount of data getting produced and processed through cloud systems is to impact the IT and business domains, and how next-generation IT infrastructures are accordingly getting refactored, remedied and readied for the impending big data-induced challenges, how likely the move of the data analytics discipline toward fulfilling the digital universe requirements of extracting and extrapolating actionable insights for the knowledge-parched is, and finally for the establishment and sustenance of the dreamt smarter planet. In short, the uninhibited explosion of digitized systems and connected devices pour out a tremendous amount of multi-structured data and the impending challenge is to make sense out of the data heaps. Data analytics is the way to go and in the recent past, the overwhelming trend is to empower our everyday systems with machine and deep learning algorithms to automatically learn out of data heaps and streams in order to be distinctively intelligent in their actions and reactions. This chapter is specially prepared to put a stimulating foundation for explaining the nitty-gritty of the Digital Twin paradigm.}

In order to clarify its scope, we propose not only a global definition, but also a complete, usage-driven classification methodology. This enables to integrate data and models as well as applications in a generic overview. Moreover, the usage-driven deployment of the Digital Twin allows to be user-centric, in order to foster acceptance. We give various examples of the interest of this classification to support the deployment of the Digital Twin in all industrial applications.}

abstract = {With the increase in sophistication and connectedness of the healthcare networks, their attack surfaces and vulnerabilities increase significantly. Malicious agents threaten patients’ health and life by stealing or altering data as it flows among the multiple domains of healthcare networks. The problem is likely to exacerbate with the increasing use of IoT devices, edge, and core clouds in the next generation healthcare networks. Presented in this paper is MUSE, a system of deep hierarchical stacked neural networks for timely and accurate detection of malicious activity that leads to alteration of meta-information or payload of the dataflow between the IoT gateway, edge and core clouds. Smaller models at the edge clouds take substantially less time to train as compared to the large models in the core cloud. To improve the speed of training and accuracy of detection of large core cloud models, the MUSE system uses a novel method of merging and aggregating layers of trained edge cloud models to construct a partly pre-trained core cloud model. As a result, the model in the core cloud takes substantially smaller number of epochs (6 to 8) and, consequently, less time, compared to those in the edge clouds, training of which take 35 to 40 epochs to converge. With the help of extensive evaluations, it is shown that with the MUSE system, large, merged models can be trained in significantly less time than the unmerged models that are created independently in the core cloud. Through several runs it is seen that the merged models give on an average 26.2% reduction in training times. From the experimental evaluation we demonstrate that along with fast training speeds the merged MUSE model gives high training and test accuracies, ranging from 95% to 100%, in detection of unknown attacks on dataflows. The merged model thus generalizes very well on the test data. This is a marked improvement when compared with the accuracy given by un-merged model as well as accuracy reported by other researchers with newer datasets.}

keywords = {Safety, Security, Cybersecurity, Integrated management, Sociotechnical, Seveso},
abstract = {The call for integrated management of safety and security (IMSS) derives from intensification of digitalisation development and the increased reliance on information communication technologies (ICT) in high-risk industries, such as the chemical and process industry. This development means tightened interconnectedness between industrial automation and control and information technology systems. As a result, the risk landscape is changed towards a stronger interconnectedness of safety, physical and (cyber)security risks, which may lead to major accidents. The objective of this paper is to examine the motivations for IMSS, the current state of IMSS, the cybersecurity-induced risks, including the actualisation of interconnected risks and some sociotechnical tools for IMSS in Seveso plants. They are plants where certain quantities of dangerous substances are present, which are subject to the requirements of the Seveso III Directive (2012/18/EU). The data considered is open source and related to cyber and physical security-induced accidents; interviews with the representatives of Seveso sites and regulators; and literature. The method is qualitative content analysis. The results show that, despite the ongoing development in IMSS at the Seveso sites, IMSS is still in its infancy. Indeed, cybersecurity is often handled in a separate IT department, and the communication with process-safety experts is often inadequate. Furthermore, safety and security risk identification and assessment are essentially undertaken separately. To achieve a real IMSS, we argue that the co-existence of technical and organisational, including structural, functional and cultural development is a fundamental aspect. The combination of such complementary aspects represents the main novelty of this study.}

Nevertheless, few studies empirically analyse how it acts as a binding force of both business practices. This study examines 1501 sustainability reports using a mixed human-artificial intelligence method based on Python's text mining libraries. This method takes advantage of AI's capabilities to extract information from large samples of data and of human critical thinking to find patterns in those data. Specifically, the method is used to evaluate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, analyse how they are deployed worldwide, and investigate their sustainability outcomes. In terms of overall frequency, robots and cybersecurity are the most often reported technologies. Broken down by the firm's region, Asian firms have the highest rate of adoption, while African firms are lagging. Regarding the themes, Industry 4.0 is mainly adopted to improve production processes and customer experience. A small percentage of firms, particularly in Europe and North America, utilize Industry 4.0 to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations. Furthermore, results indicate that Industry 4.0 and sustainability are following two routes. Some firms have massively adopted Industry 4.0 to increase operational efficiency and reaped environmental gains as an indirect consequence of improved operations. Others have chosen to balance the adoption of technologies aimed to increase productivity with innovations whose explicit aim is the reduction of their operations' environmental footprint, such as additive manufacturing. Eastern firms tend to follow the first route while western firms the second. African and South American firms are still at a very early stage in their Industry 4.0 and sustainability journey. At the global level, Industry 4.0 is still far from being utilized as a catalyst to develop sustainability-driven business models.}

abstract = {The application of intelligence to manufacturing has emerged as a compelling topic for researchers and industries around the world. However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keyword frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.}

Specifically, the cyber resilience of multiple power electronics devices in power generation (photovoltaic and wind), power transmission (high-voltage direct-current), power prosumption (electric vehicle, smart building, microgrid), power storage, and grid-tied converters, are addressed, respectively. In addition, this review thoroughly investigates the representative cyber-attack events, cyber-defense threats, cybersecurity regulations, and graphical cyber–physical architectures of the power electronics-enabled power system. As a result, this review proposes a general cybersecurity paradigm of power electronics closed-loop controllers. Therein, the cyber timescale, stealthiness, and threat between power electronics closed-loop controllers and power grid open-loop applications are investigated, respectively.}

The most effective way to acquire necessary skills is a “learning by doing” way in industrial projects and processes. The learning factory FleXtory was designed and produced in this objective and at the crossroad of the academic and the industrial environment. It allows running combinations of theoretical and applied tools in the context of industry 4.0. This is based on interactive loops between the real and the virtual world passing through the digital twin of the learning factory. The pedagogical modules developed within this learning factory address the evolution of professional competencies and skills in according to the transition to industry 4.0. This transformation supposes the development of the ability for professionals to work within a digital environment. In this paper we propose an architecture model of FleXtory favoring the return on experience/information loop within the digital transformation of the learning factory. The originality of our work is to consider this architecture from the point of view of the pedagogical specifications of the proposed learning models and the future perspective of their use.}

The progressive introduction of connected satellite systems and associated mission concepts is stimulating the development of intelligent CPS (iCPS) architectures, which can support high levels of flexibility and resilience in an increasingly congested near-Earth space environment. The need for higher levels of automation and autonomy in satellite operations has stimulated numerous research initiatives in recent years, focusing on the progressive enhancement of systemic performance (e.g., addressing safety, integrity and cyber-physical security metrics) and associated monitoring/augmentation approaches that can support Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operations (TASO). Despite these advances, in most contemporary satellite platforms, autonomy is restricted to a specific set of rules and cases, while the transition to TASO requires a paradigm shift in the design of both space vehicles and ground-based systems. In particular, the use of AI is seen as an essential enabler for TASO as it enhances system performance/adaptability and supports both predictive and reactive integrity augmentation capabilities, especially in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). This article provides a critical review of AI for satellite operations, with a special focus on current and likely future DSS architectures for communication, navigation and remote sensing missions. The aim is to identify key contemporary challenges and opportunities associated with space iCPS design methodologies to enhance the performance and resilience of satellite systems, supporting the progressive transition to TASO. A comprehensive review of relevant AI techniques is presented to critically assess the potential benefits and challenges of each method for different space applications. After describing the specificities of DSS and the opportunities offered by iCPS architectures, the co-evolution of space and control (ground and on-board) segments is highlighted as an essential next step towards enabling TASO. As an integral part of this evolutionary approach, the most important legal and regulatory challenges associated with the adoption of AI in TASO are also discussed.}

This paper proposes a decision-making framework for a multi-product hybrid layout production system under stochastic disruptions using a simulation model. The simulation model will act as a digital twin of the physical system, which helps to proactively visualize and analyze several key performance parameters of the system and make informed decisions. The objective of this paper is to identify the best sequence from predefined sequences for jobs, which maximize profit, throughput, and minimize cost, and make-span. Several experimentation cases are developed to analyze the performance of the system under different scenarios of disruptions and make strategic decisions such as investing in new machines, prioritizing products, and rescheduling of products.}

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to explore the role of the safe and optimal scheduling of thermal energy storage systems in intelligent buildings in promoting sustainable economic development under Digital Twins (DTs) technology. Phase Change Material (PCM) has high energy density, constant temperature storage, small footprint, and long service life. Here, PCM is first placed in the indoor building structure, and the DTs technology is introduced. In the development of intelligent buildings, the data generated by the energy storage system of intelligent buildings in the real space can be mapped to the virtual space in real time for simultaneous analysis. In addition, the PCM wall structure and thermal network DTs model are designed for the intelligent building. In addition, the PCW structure is used to build a thermal energy storage and dispatch model of the smart thermoelectric building based on DTs. Finally, the model is evaluated and analyzed experimentally. The analysis of system optimization power under different schemes indicates that the scheduling operation strategy of thermal energy storage of building walls can avoid overcharging or over-discharging batteries in the microgrid and reduce battery power consumption. Besides, the building wall energy storage capacity is always in the range of 0.2 ∼ 0.8 on the all-weather scale. Moreover, the model constructed here achieves significantly lower economic costs, environmental costs, and energy costs and a better energy-saving effect than the existing model. The model built here can serve as experimental reference for further digital energy storage in intelligent buildings and comprehensive energy utilization because of its superior safety performance and lower consumption.}

abstract = {The endeavour towards making power distribution systems (PDSs) smarter has made the interdependence on communication network indispensable. Further, prospective high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources in the form of distributed energy resources (DERs) has resulted in the necessity for smart controllers on such DERs. Inverters are employed for the purpose of DC to AC power conversion in the distribution network where the present standards require these inverters to be smart. In general, distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) calculate and send set points/operating points to these smart inverters using protocols such as smart energy profile (SEP) 2.0. Given the nature of sites at which such DERs are installed i.e., home area networks with a pool of IoT(Internet-of-Things) devices, the opportunity for a malicious actor to sabotage the operation is typically higher than that for a transmission system. National Electric Sector Cyber-security Organization Resource (NESCOR) has described several failure scenarios and impact analyses in case of cyber attacks on DERs. One such failure scenario concerns attacks on real/reactive power control commands. In this paper, it is demonstrated that physical invariant based security on the edge devices, i.e. smart controllers deployed in DER inverters, is an effective approach to minimize the impact of cyber attacks targeting reactive power control in DER inverters. The proposed defense is generic and can also be extended to attacks on real-power control. The proposed defense is validated on a co-simulation platform (OpenDSS and MATLAB/SIMULINK).}

Manufacturers need to make sure that the systems function in the intended way and according to specifications. This is not a trivial task as system complexity rises dramatically the more integrated and interconnected these systems become with the addition of automated functionality and features to them. This effort translates into an overhead on the V&V (verification and validation) process making it time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present VALU3S, an ECSEL JU (joint undertaking) project that aims to evaluate the state-of-the-art V&V methods and tools, and design a multi-domain framework to create a clear structure around the components and elements needed to conduct the V&V process. The main expected benefit of the framework is to reduce time and cost needed to verify and validate automated systems with respect to safety, cyber-security, and privacy requirements. This is done through identification and classification of evaluation methods, tools, environments and concepts for V&V of automated systems with respect to the mentioned requirements. VALU3S will provide guidelines to the V&V community including engineers and researchers on how the V&V of automated systems could be improved considering the cost, time and effort of conducting V&V processes. To this end, VALU3S brings together a consortium with partners from 10 different countries, amounting to a mix of 25 industrial partners, 6 leading research institutes, and 10 universities to reach the project goal.}

Even though the integration of intelligent technologies offers unlimited potential in precision commercial agriculture, optimal resource management remains a challenge considering that IoT infrastructure is unevenly distributed across the world and concentrated in high-income countries. The utilization of IoT technologies in smart greenhouses often involves a tradeoff between the cost of agricultural production, environmental conservation, ecological degradation, and sustainability. The installation of IoT infrastructure is capital-intensive and often translates to higher energy demand, that elevates the risk for climate change. The widespread use of IoT sensors and networks also increases new challenges in the management of electronic waste, depletion of finite resources, and destruction of fragile ecosystems, resulting in climate change. the integration of IoT systems in greenhouses would be augmented by the global deployment of advanced 5G technology and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation broadband internet with low latency and high speeds. Intelligent application of agrochemicals could yield significant savings ($500/acre or more), while need-based irrigation and fertilizer application would help improve crop yields. Globally, the deployment of IoT infrastructure would yield about $500 billion of added value to the GDP by 2030. The forecasted economic benefits affirm that the applications of IoT for optimized greenhouse environment and resources management were sustainable, and any potential risks are incomparable to the long-term benefits in commercial agriculture. The review article contributes new insights on the role of IoT in agriculture 4.0, the challenges, and future prospects for developing nations, which lacked the resources to invest in precision agriculture technologies.}

abstract = {In recent years, organizations have developed new cybersecurity solutions, such as policies, procedures, techniques, and frameworks, to help mitigate long-term threats, risks, and potential vulnerabilities aimed at their organizational network systems. Customizing existing cybersecurity policies, processes, and standards ensures that organizations adopt and align their technology capabilities to address insider and external cyber threats. This chapter discusses Zero Trust and Internet of Things device security, protection, and interoperability. It outlines how Zero Trust concepts and methods focus on the security issues related to IoT systems. Zero Trust capability delivers security solutions for enterprise applications and endpoints. Zero Trust diverges from the traditional network perimeter, where the access request is granted without identifying and validating the requestor's message. Improved cybersecurity frameworks and tools are designed to streamline the time and resources allocated to perform IoT platforms' cybersecurity risk assessments and management frameworks. Zero Trust Network Architecture implementation focuses on robust device identity verification, compliance, and validation. This security policy is based on granted and least privileged access to only explicitly authorized resources. Continuous implementation of the Zero Trust Architecture is based on a traditional method, such as limited trust in devices connected to the organization's perimeter network infrastructure. Standardized Zero Trust policies and solutions must minimize and mitigate current and future threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Organizations must develop and implement security best practices to ensure continuous platform federations among IoT devices/objects. Developing and implementing security best practices to ensure continuous platform federations among IoT devices/objects is key to the organization's operational functions and productivity. This chapter also discusses details about current Zero Trust solutions for IoT security. It recommends future solutions, policies, and frameworks. Zero Trust capability is innovative and advanced security architecture involving products, infrastructure, framework, strategies, vendors, and customers. Organizations are responsible for defining, enforcing, and standardizing their Zero Trust policies. This process enables monitoring and terminating the users' access and connections established between the user and enterprise resource. To adequately enforce policy, evaluating all access requests that are multi-factor authenticated is key to ensuring that proper security controls are applied. Such a process often includes all access requests submitted from an unexpected location.}

abstract = {A digital twin (DT) is an exact digital replica of a physical world object or asset that aids in managing, controlling, or monitoring the real object. The current systems used for managing DTs are centralized and not easily accessible. Typically, a DT is built by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and becomes hard to access and manage once its physical asset is transported or sold to a new owner. Moreover, a physical asset or object is typically comprised of many other physical sub-components. This translates to having one DT comprised of other sub-DTs. In this paper, we show how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be used to manage ownership of DTs and to provide proof of delivery (PoD) of their associated physical assets in a decentralized, secure, traceable, and transparent manner. Specifically, we propose, implement, and evaluate a solution to manage DTs and their sub-DTs using NFTs and sub-NFTs. The DTs and their sub-DTs are represented in a hierarchical way, whereby a sub-NFT maps to a sub-DT along with its physical object. We present the system architecture and design, as well as the implementation of algorithms and smart contracts along with thorough testing and validation details. We present the security analysis as well as discuss the generalization aspect of the proposed solution. All developed smart contract codes are made publicly available on GitHub.}

It emerges from the confluence of operational technologies (OT) and information technologies (IT), which allows for higher flexibility and manufacturing of unique custom products to suit individual customer requirements. To assure quality, embracing digital transformation of non-destructive evaluation is essential. It can be an integral part of the cyber-controlled production and asset life-cycle maintenance. These two value propositions covering the asset life cycle, require digitally controlled NDE procedures and qualitative data to support automated decision making, for most known situations. With that scenario, NDE must be considered in conjunction with other engineering disciplines. Reliability assessments become a necessary prerequisite for the use of NDE data. In addition, the approach to inspector certification and experience needs to be revised. The digital technologies that are being deployed to enhance production under industry 4.0 can very well be the enablers of digitalized NDE and their integration with the asset and its owner. Model-based definition, smart robots, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and digital twins can all be used to enhance NDE inspections to a new level of performance in quality and safety assurance. These new NDE trends are summarized under the term “NDE 4.0” to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. The present review paper is aimed at capturing recent advances in digital technologies for non-destructive inspections, examples of their use, and other aspects that must be addressed to shift the paradigm. The paper also highlights the global collaboration and current trends, with an intent to inspire industry professionals to engage with NDE 4.0 – a must for Industry 4.0.}

This work proposes a data-driven approach to utilize digital transformation methods to automate smart manufacturing systems. This is fundamentally enabled by using a digital twin to represent manufacturing cells, simulate system behaviors, predict process faults, and adaptively control manipulated variables. First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a network of interfaces between the environments is designed and implemented to enable communication between the digital world and physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel combination between data science and manufacturing industries.}

In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyber–physical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.}

Inspired by the need to better understand their idiosyncrasies, particular needs and implications, this paper aims to scrutinise current issues and concerns about digital transformation in the remanufacturing systems. In particular, the paper reviews the extant literature to observe: (1) how the I4.0 technologies have so far been used in remanufacturing and (2) the benefits and risks that need to be considered by remanufacturers when adopting the I4.0 technologies. We have elucidated the significance of our findings and subsequently synthesised our thoughts into eight propositions that demystify the mechanisms of how the I4.0 technologies can bring potential benefits when used by remanufacturers to accomplish a portfolio of remanufacturing tasks, and the risks they need to be aware of. This articulation represents contributions to knowledge as it will set out the underpinning of the future human-technology collaboration, which is key in the I4.0 realm.}

abstract = {The Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS) is a new type of system in which the traditional energy system is integrated into the information network with control systems, communication networks, and computational units. CPPS is the foundation of a long-term transformation of energy management that will fundamentally alter the perspective and application pattern of traditional energy research. The strong interactions between systems in a CPPS introduce new challenges in maintaining high supply security, as new factors can affect the overall security of the power system. Such factors include cybersecurity, the behaviour and constraints of neighbouring energy systems, and the dynamics of interactions between the various systems. Integrating computing, communications, and control at all levels of electrical energy generation, transmission, distribution, utilisation, and storage in CPPS increases vulnerabilities and complicates security. Security studies must reflect the characteristics of the CPPS infrastructure in actual testing environments that support the interfacing of real-world hardware devices. CPPS testbeds are effective in this context because they provide testing capabilities for evaluating the synergistic relationship between physical and virtual components in controlled environments. Security-oriented CPPS testbeds are invaluable for performing cybersecurity and cyberattack analyses, identifying system threats and vulnerabilities in various layers of CPPS, implementing intrusion detection and prevention algorithms, and evaluating the efficacy of mitigation techniques without imposing excessive economic burdens or posing safety risks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CPPS testbeds from the standpoint of the physical power system layer, cyber system layer, and cyber-physical fusion layer. Following a brief description of the importance of testbeds for cybersecurity research in CPPS, and a brief classification of existing CPPS testbeds for cyberattacks, and cybersecurity analysis in CPPS is presented. A detailed overview of the outlook for future CPPS testbeds in terms of communication, control, computing, and educational perspective is provided. Finally, the work is concluded with future research directions for developing a secure electric power grid.}

Adapting DTs to serve cities, the question arises of what an urban digital twin should contain and how it should be orchestrated to serve a city’s dynamical ecosystem, along with how to enhance the efficiency of the city. We are aligning with the commonplace idea that the main advantage of using DTs is economical as, for example, DTs can improve the planning of activities thus saving money and time. But how can they be useful for a city? Instead of looking at the DTs as solutions in search of problems to be solved, we start from city needs. Our approach is two-fold. We start by briefly reviewing existing possibilities for meeting some specific needs, but keep the focus on identifying and attempting to close the gap between the needs arising from everyday city functions and the latest DT techniques useful for meeting those needs. DTs are technically different and serve different applications, yet they share a common identity and name, as well as several technical similarities. Adopting computer science terminology, we see a back-end city DT as the container of all information, while any single front-end, visualized or used either by humans or robots, offers a limited but meaningful representation of the DT for a specific application. Alas, there are multiple open questions regarding the realization and benefits of such back-end DT. Nevertheless, we discuss how the back-end DT (or any specific DT) could be updated autonomously from sensor data using artificial intelligence techniques, and how the front-ends could be used for large benefits to the entire city ecosystem.}

abstract = {Context:
Cyber–physical systems (CPS) are increasingly self-adaptive, i.e. they have the ability to introspect and change their behavior. This self-adaptation process must be considered when modeling the safety and security aspects of the system.
Objective:
This study collects and compares security attacks and safety hazards on self-adaptive systems (SAS) described in the literature. In addition, mitigation and treatment strategies, as well as the modeling and analysis approaches, are investigated.
Method:
We conducted a systematic literature review on 21 selected papers. The selection process included a database search on four scientific databases using a common search string (1430 papers), forward and backward snowballing (1402 papers), and filtering the results based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The coding scheme to analyze the content of the papers was obtained through research questions, existing domain-specific taxonomies, and open coding.
Results:
Safety and security are not jointly modeled in the context of self-adaptive systems. The adaptation process is often not considered in the attack and hazard analysis due to naïve assumptions and modeling. The proposed approaches are mostly verified and validated through simulation often using simple use cases and scenarios.
Conclusion:
A thorough and joint modeling approach for safety and security in self-adaptive systems is still an open challenge that needs to be addressed. Further work is needed to address the gap between safety and security modeling in self-adaptive systems. Editor’s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.}

This distributed management mode has two disadvantages: (1) The gateway control is adopted by the IIoT cloud platform for the device command operation. Once having the command rights on the IIoT cloud platform, users can operate the devices without restrictions; (2) The IIoT cloud platform records the log of the user’s device command operation behavior through a database or file, which is vulnerable to tampering. Therefore, a blockchain-enabled device command operation security scheme for the IIoT cloud platform is proposed, which adds a flexible control factor – command asset quota – to control the number of command operations, and added the allocation and recycling of the command asset quotas based on blockchain transactions, as well as the storage and recording of the command operation behavior logs. In the paper, the classification, value calculation, asset model and quota allocation and recycling mechanism of device commands are descripted in detail, and the reference implementation project is carried out. Finally, this scheme prototype is implemented based on the IIoT platform Jetlinks, OceanConnect and the alliance chain Fisco Bcos. Experiments show that this scheme not only solves the above two problems, but also is feasible, security, efficient and resilient.}

Combined with cybersecurity, they become fundamental elements for creating intelligence in an industrial system that can increase the flexibility of production in addition to allocating resources more efficiently. In order to successfully transition to ecosystem 4.0, the industry must examine the new skills that are required and the need for qualified personnel. The fourth industrial revolution corresponds to the widespread use of sensors and intelligent agents to connect machines, components, processes and operators. This is generally called the digital factory or industry 4.0. It suggests a global system of effective communication between the modules of decision-making. World 4.0 will allow interaction between products, machines and even between machines (M2M). The product will also be able to communicate with machines in the production phase. This is called intelligent production, which will allow the modification and customization of products in their production phase. In this article, we present a communication model based on Modbus and multiband communication using NB-IOT, this communication model allows data to be exchanged between different industrial equipment (PLCs, SCADA systems, etc.) via MODBUS RTU and ASCII, via RS485, or via analog and digital inputs for sensors and actuators.}

abstract = {Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) struggle with the uptake of industrial data in their business. SMEs have expressed interests to integrate physical legacy machines in factories and uptake Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for data-driven industrial processes. A widely recognizable aids for companies are testbeds or test-before-invest environments where companies can familiarize themselves with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. In this paper, an easily scalable approach to collect industrial data is presented. The environment can be used by SMEs to benchmark the developed solutions using affordable licenses and test aspects of the industrial data best suitable for their purposes before making investments. In TAMK FieldLab I4.0 pilot trial, horizontal integration is done in between 14.0 field and control layer to integrate different machines' data to common database and common format to be used for visualization and later for data analysis. The focus of the paper is on data connectivity capabilities. The trial utilize data from different machines. First phase includes exporting data from different machines to same data table with time stamps, to enable comparison of data with same time base. With common time base it's possible to produce synchronized timeseries data visualization from all TAMK FieldLab's machines. Used common database is PostgreSQL, where data from all machines is stored. For horizontal field level integration minimum amount APIs and protocols is used. For common API protocol MQTT was chosen as it's lightweight and supported widely. ABB robot data is taken trough OPC/UA and MQTT. From Omron mobile robot data is transferred trough ARCL. The paper will identify gap areas of the implementation in comparison with I4.0 and when appropriate, RAM 4.0 framework. Finally, the next steps that will be taken in near future regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and upgrading the IIoT system to match with RAMI 4.0 framework will be presented.}

This concept aims at creating systems that improve the vertical and horizontal integration of production through (i) comprehensive and intelligent automation of industrial processes, (ii) informed and decentralized real-time decision making, and (iii) stringent quality requirements that can be monitored at any time. The I4.0 infrastructure, supported in many cases by robots, sensors, and algorithms, demands highly skilled workers able to continuously monitor the quality of both the items to be produced and the underlying production processes. While the first attempts to develop smart factories and enhance the digital transformation of companies are under way, we need adequate methods to support the identification and specification of quality attributes that are relevant to I4.0 systems. Our main contribution is to provide a refined version of the ISO 25010 quality model specifically tailored to those qualities demanded by I4.0 needs. This model aims to provide actionable support for I4.0 software engineers that are concerned with quality issues. We developed our model based on an exhaustive analysis of similar proposals using the design science method as well as expertise from seasoned engineers in the domain. We further evaluate our model by applying it to two important I4.0 reference architectures further clarifying its application.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.}

The framework enables reliable and effective cybersecurity testing of industrial infrastructures, with the ultimate goal of improving the resilience of critical processes to cyber-physical attacks. It takes a cue from the TIBER-EU initiative, of which it extends the core penetration testing phases to “hybrid”–meaning consisting of a mix of real and simulated components–setups. By doing so, it relieves operators from their main concern, i.e., the risk of compromising the normal functioning of control systems when performing key security testing activities, such as gathering information on cyber-threats and/or trying out alternative response strategies. InfraStress-EU was implemented and evaluated in close cooperation with five operators, who contributed the requirements of real setups in their respective industrial sectors.}

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), or Industry 4.0, is the industrial application of IoT. Industry 4.0 transforms production equipment into IoTs, which in turn transmit production-related data or their operational status to other connected devices or servers for rapid storage or processing. The results of the processing are used in real-time for the control and supervision of the production system. With the time constraints related to the availability of the processing results, companies have more and more computing servers. These IoT application computing servers are the fog. While processing IoT application data, fog servers require cloud intervention to offload tasks to free them up and provide data storage. Edge computing joins the game when connected objects are themselves computing resources. One of the main challenges of these technologies is the scheduling of dependent/independent tasks. Scheduling IoT workflows in the fog to optimize quality of service (QoS) metrics often requires offloading some tasks to the cloud in order to meet customer satisfaction and service level agreement (SLA) constraints. Therefore, many algorithms have been developed to schedule workflows in the cloud-fog environment. To organize this research, we present a literature review on scheduling workflows in cloud, fog, and edge environments. We outline a taxonomy that systematically classifies existing approaches. Finally, we identify challenges for future work.}

abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, machines and devices are increasingly getting connected. These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices’ known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.}

In this regard, the paper aims to provide a framework with the potentials for sustainability for farmers derived from five pillars and their modelling on a digital twin model with simulation capabilities. The goal is to develop an approach and a tool that would enhance the capabilities of smallholders to face any disruption by supporting them in all their management and control activities. Thus, the model aims to analyze the effects of risks as well as the policies that can prevent them, act to reduce their impacts, or react against any internal or external risks in three levels: farmer´s organization, supply chain, and the related environment based on the Corporate Social Sustainability. The purpose is to increase the resilience of smallholders through the improvement and optimization of the agro-food supply chain and related environment of any smallholder organization considering all related stakeholders. As a result, the final goal of the model is the development of recommendations for enhancing future capabilities to secure viability in the long-term.}

This article provides overview of these concerns, highlighting the various ways in which smart city technologies can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other security threats. Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply. Further research is required to better understand the potential risks associated with smart city technologies and develop new solutions to address them.

The virtual representation of the several IIoT departments, such as manufacturing process, packaging, warehousing, and logistics enables predictive maintenance for optimizing local material resources for manufacturing and packaging, improved warehouse space allocation, and delivery schedule optimization. The high volume of data generated from IoT devices are exposed to cyber-attacks using modern attack vectors and thus threaten both physical IIoT environment and its digital twins. Existing intrusion detection systems focus on identifying anomalous traffic using obsolete knowledge of cyber-attack patterns for several attacks, such as ARP poisoning man-in-the-middle attacks, SSL-based attacks using encrypted traffic, and DNS flood-based DDoS traffic. A lack of focus on security using updated and comprehensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) threatens the security of the IIoT environment. In this paper, we present a Federated Learning based CTI framework based on Information Fusion (FL-CTIF) for securing IIoT environments. We design a comprehensive cyberattack dataset with updated feature selection using Information Fusion to improve the accuracy in identifying cyber-attacks. A federated learning-based ANN model is designed to reduce the model training rounds based on satisfaction level and measure the absence of improvement in each attack vector's average accuracy. The model is evaluated based on model aggregation performance and demonstrates an improved F1 score based on reduced training rounds and reduced CPU consumption. The federated learning model improves accuracy and reduces the false positive rate using the newly merged dataset compared to existing research.}

However, there is no empirical evidence of the extent of applications and the permeability level in ensuring the three resources’ security. This study explored the relationship of the fourth industrial revolution technologies and the water, energy, and food nexus by evaluating the applications of the various technologies of 4IR on WEF nexus and examined the effect of 4IR on WEF nexus. The objectives were achieved using the qualitative methodology and bibliometric analysis of content analysis. The result showed that most fourth industrial revolution technologies had not been integrated with the WEF nexus. The result showed that only the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics had permeated the nexus, which shows that data of the resources will be the foundation of the nexus. The systematic collection, accuracy of data, and empirical analysis of data will determine the level of security of WEF nexus. The qualitative results show that there are applications of the fourth industrial revolution technologies to the individual sectors of the nexus, birthing Water 4.0, Energy 4.0, and Food 4.0. The Bibliometric analysis result shows that the integration of the fourth industrial revolution with the WEF nexus will lead to cleaner production practices relating to the technological processes of water, energy, and food resources. These practices will ensure the environment's safety from WEF wastes and the water, energy, and food security in production processes. The empirical research and bibliometric analysis result, rooted in the concept of cleaner production, shows that the fourth industrial revolution affected the WEF nexus. The effects are; the birth of clean technologies & industrial applications, the catalyst for sustainability security of WEF nexus leveraging on life cycle thinking, enablement of technological transfer, enhancement of economic growth, and urban planning. The study concludes that the fourth industrial revolution technologies affect WEF nexus, ensuring the popularization of cleaner production strategies and processes of the resources during trade-offs and synergies. The study recommends the integration of a cleaner production concept in WEF processing. It should follow the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and Technology acceptance theory (TAM) when applying 4IR technologies to the nexus of water, energy, and food resources, for their sustainable security.}

A unified namespace for machines in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network is only reliable when machine assets can trust and verify the identity of assets connected to the IIoT system. Current methods of asset authentication do not consider physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and can easily be spoofed or misused. Our work proposes using PUFs for industrial equipment such as CNC machines, robots, and 3D printers for identifying machines on a network and providing authentication procedures. In this work, we chose to use the vibration associated with machines and its embedded moving parts as a means to identify machine assets on a network. It is hypothesized that the vibrations associated with specific machine movements will be unique to each machine even when machines look exactly the same. The moving parts within a machine may produce a unique vibration pattern that can be used for machine identification throughout the working cycle. Our method requires light computing and relatively cheap measuring devices to capture the ‘fingerprints’ of machines and verify the signal's integrity. An adequate number of equipment has been tested for the worst-case scenario, i.e. when two machines look exactly the same with the same moving parts and produce exactly similar motion to generate the vibration signal. Data preprocessing and standard machine learning techniques like RF, LASSO, and SVM show great performance on raw time series data, enabling 100% TPR and more than 94% TNR in detecting the false class of the machines.}

This increasing complexity can only be faced with the advanced autonomy of production systems, supporting in running, analyzing, and optimizing the equipment. A critical enabler to achieving this is modeling the system's state and executed process. However, this modeling requires extensive manual effort and expert knowledge. Automated process discovery approaches from the domain of process mining (PM) seem promising in reducing this effort, however, utilizing the low-level machine controller events results in models too complex for human interpretation. Therefore, we introduce an approach capable of clustering low-level events from I/O signals of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to higher-level system states to automatically discover human-understandable process models of manufacturing systems, supporting analysis and optimization}

abstract = {Almost a decade ago, the research community embarked on a journey to realize the old vision of Industry 4.0. Part of this vision was to digitize design and manufacturing systems and processes, aimed at advancing their vertical and horizontal integration into decentralized ecosystems across the entire product development value chain. This process was to include the provision of new data-driven operation and business models, advances in cybersecurity, and the development of a bespoke Industry 4.0 workforce. In this paper, the authors review the state-of-the-art in regard to the progress made to date, from initial vision towards implementation in industry. They identify critical research challenges and gaps that need to be addressed to further advance this transition. The paper closes with a strategic perspective on how the authors anticipate Industry 4.0 to evolve over the next 5 years.}

A DT has been used to assess the effect of different design parameters on several performance measure. The quantitative evaluation of the effects of the multiple design parameters on the multiple performance measures is achieved by using the DOE being validated by means of the analysis of variance (ANOVA).

abstract = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has resulted in a proliferation of connected devices and their applications. Autonomous IoT (AIoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that operate without human intervention, making decisions and performing tasks autonomously. Traditional methods of provisioning IoT devices, such as manual configuration and over-the-air updates, are error-prone and insecure. The emergence of eSIMs (embedded SIMs) provides a viable solution for secure and flexible identity management in IoT devices. This work implements a low-cost, zero-touch remote provisioning system using GSMA standard Over-The-Air (OTA) IoT-SAFE protocol. This research predicts that future IoT devices will be eSIM-enabled, which are simple to configure, provision, validate profiles, and check security policies remotely. IoT onboarding processes are designed where blockchains are used to verify immutable repositories to store this network manifests, verifiable by Ethereum smart contracts. The integrated framework combines blockchain contracts, eSIM-based remote SIM provisioning through IoT-SAFE protocol, and SDN to manage IoT ecosystems' security. The proposed solution is evaluated using simulations and security analysis, and it demonstrates its feasibility at scale and resilience to attacks even under insecure environments. When compared with the baseline IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, our SDN-based Remote-SIM provisioning system (SIeSIM) reduces overhead to about 240 ms Time-To-Provision (TTP), outperforming manual provisioning by nearly 320 % and 210 % compared to expert provisioning in terms of TTP performances, respectively.}

In particular, the use of tele-remote systems, as SCADA, allows the collection of data and the control of hydraulic devices. Today, by benefiting from the power of computers and servers, the digital twins of hydrographical networks can be designed. A digital twin aims to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a canal.

In particular, maintenance is one of the most researched applications, as the impact of the execution of maintenance task may have a great impact in the business of the companies. For example, in sector such as energy or manufacturing, a maintenance activity can cause the shutdown of an entire production line, or in the case of a wind turbine inspection, may face the safety of an operator to measure a simple indicator. Hence, the application of more intelligent maintenance strategies can offer huge benefits. In this context, this paper focuses on the review of DT applications for maintenance, as no previous work has been found with this aim. For instance, both “Digital Twin” and “maintenance” concepts and strategies are described in detail, and then a literature review is carried out where these two concepts are involved. In addition to identifying and analyzing how DTs are currently being applied for maintenance, this paper also highlights future research lines and open issues.}

As digitally enabled manufacturing machines continue to grow exponentially, it becomes imperative to uniquely and securely identify them in the cyber-physical world, particularly in defense, biomedical, energy and aerospace manufacturing. Research about threats originating from internal adversaries’ i.e the machine/organization owner within a tiered digitally connected supply chain is scarce. This paper introduces a machine fingerprinting scheme named as the ‘Witness Box Protocol’ (WBP) that exploits the physical properties of manufacturing machines (legacy or smart) and their surroundings to create a unique biometric like fingerprint. WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. In this research, fingerprints were randomly generated from the statistical features of signals from 3D printers and CNC machine in a production-like lab environment. Using k-means clustering and Jaccard similarity index, these fingerprints are shown to identify the source equipment with 95 % accuracy.}

abstract = {Globally, the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry has seen a rise in the adoption of digital twin (DT) technologies due to their potential to enhance collaboration and information communication throughout the project lifecycle from the design to operation and maintenance (O&M) phase. However, empirical evidence on such adoption is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities during the O&M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O&M phase using four geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM activities by providing real-time status of the building assets. However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O&M phase of buildings. As such, this paper’s contribution is twofold: (1) it provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities during the O&M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM decision-making processes.}

Despite limitations in transitioning from tangible human presence to the digital realm in cyberspace, extensive efforts are underway to harness emotional, visual, and oral responses, thereby enhancing the reasoning and predictive capabilities of digital twins. These advancements aim to elevate real-time human interactions with physical and virtual systems by integrating intelligent AI algorithms and cognitive computing systems into digital twins. This paper meticulously analyses recent trends in digital twins, tracing their evolution from traditional concepts and applications to a nuanced digital triplet hierarchy that incorporates human intuition, knowledge, and creativity within cyberspace. we delve into the hierarchical framework of the digital triplet, resonating with maturity, domination, and volition levels, enhances cognitive and perceptual capabilities in cyberspace. The study provides a systematic overview of the development of ultra-realistic digital models, incorporating real-time data-driven artefacts that integrate intelligent activities with multidomain, multiphysics, and multiscale simulations. The research scope is focused on augmenting the perceptive and heuristic capabilities of the digital triplet framework by utilizing AI in data analytics, retrieving heterogeneous data from virtual entities using semantic artificial intelligence technologies, and amalgamating AI and machine learning with human insight and perceptual knowledge. The proposed digital triplet hierarchy aims to enhance cyberspace's capacity for learning, cognitive skills, and knowledge transfer. It can be a guideline for the researcher to promote cognitive augmentation of the human brain through brain-machine/computer interface, virtual, augmented, and extended reality, fostering a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines in the industrial metaverse and industry 5.0.

The analysis highlights that MESs should interconnect all components of cyber-physical systems in a seamless, secure, and trustworthy manner to enable high-level automated smart solutions and that semantic metadata can provide contextual information to support interoperability and modular development.

Going beyond simply the automation of manufacturing systems, Industry 4.0 involves the convergence of information and automation technology to create cyber-physical systems which virtualize and optimise the manufacturing process on a global scale. The traditional unidisciplinary or multidisciplinary engineering approach has been extremely successful for the provision of Mechatronics Engineers for Industry 3.0 over the past decades. But the complexities of the cyber physical systems which must be implemented as part of Industry 4.0 require a much more comprehensive systems engineering approach. This has resulted in the requirement for the new occupation of Equipment Systems Engineers (ESE) who have been introduced to, and are capable of utilizing an interdisciplinary or even anti-disciplinary approach. This paper describes the development and implementation of an Industry-Led Masters programme at the University of Limerick which was designed specifically to meet the unique skillset required for this rapidly developing field. The development of a unique Industry 4.0 teaching space is described as well as the creation of three manufacturing cells and their ‘digital twins’ which recreate the environment found in the field. They allow Virtual and Augmented Reality technologies to be used to interact remotely with the equipment. Close collaboration with Industry Experts is a strong feature of the design and delivery of the programme. The teaching methods were also novel and an implementation of the CDIO method is described.

Typically, such systems are created based on images captured during printing or sensor data for tracking the extruder’s movement. This work presents a novel approach to sensor data-driven fault diagnosis, utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to investigate the temperature imbalance in the extruder and printing surface. First, a Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (LCNN) is proposed to detect faults from sensory data. The model’s architecture concatenates the CNN layer to extract additional features, improving the model’s performance while maintaining a lightweight configuration suitable for real-time monitoring systems. Second, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) technology for FDM 3D printer fault detection is introduced. The DT creates a virtual representation of a physical object, and its functionality is validated by examining the network’s latency and System Overhead (SO) as the number of clients increases. The simulation results show that the proposed LCNN with a DT environment can effectively monitor, detect, and control the physical workplace with an F1-Score of 0.9981 and an average latency of 995.4253ms.

The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed ‘Paludiculture’) present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing ‘green’ eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from ‘brown to green’ must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the ‘Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution’. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.}

abstract = {Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.}

Even though numerous procedures are in place to increase the security and dependability of data in IoT applications, the majority of outside users can decode any transferred data at any time. Therefore, it is essential to include data blocks that, under any circumstance, other external users cannot understand. The major significance of proposed method is to incorporate an offloading technique for data processing that is carried out by using block chain technique where complete security is assured for each data. Since a problem methodology is designed with respect to clusters a load balancing technique is incorporated with data weights where parametric evaluations are made in real time to determine the consistency of each data that is monitored with IoT. The examined outcomes with five scenarios process that projected model on offloading analysis with block chain proves to be more secured thereby increasing the accuracy of data processing for each IoT applications to 89%.}

We apply topic modeling and sentiment analysis on the textual corpora. Our analysis shows that certain topics related to applications, simulation, and enabling technologies for Digital Twin find greater coverage and generate higher positivity over time. We ascertain the coevolution and divergence in the number and sentiment of topics through curve matching metrics and determine whether they can rouse consumer interest, captured through online search trends. Our regression analysis shows that news on applications of Digital Twin and research on process evaluation through real-time simulation significantly impact the search frequency of consumers.

In respect to its practical world applications, the IoT has the prospect of entirely transforming the pharma industry by facilitating and mechanizing the isolated nursing of patients, the innovation of different types of drugs, their admittance, and much more. The combination of the IoT with the growing digitization of figures in the pharma segment has led to a new direction and opened the floodgates for enormous changes and industrial scale innovations. While striving for ingenious inventions, the software needs to keep pace. As previously observed, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are providing tremendous opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry. Similarly, the IoT offers pharma production with an assortment of innovative prospects, such as an improved mechanism for drug trade and better analytical tools. Now the question is how can the IoT be used to benefit the pharmaceutical industry? The answer is that IoT sensors and detectors can help in enabling the optimal circumstances for supervising different styles of biomaterials and chemicals, detecting tool flaws, and it can be also used to assist in the prevention of fraudulent drug activities. People who are involved in industries like pharmaceuticals work in a risk-prone industry where they must avoid asset failures at any cost, as making mistakes is unacceptable because quality control has a direct impact on the health of the consumer and there should be no opportunities for errors to be made. There are a variety of problems that may arise in plants during the manufacture of drugs, such as wear and tear of equipment with time, corrosion, excessive voltage, and destruction caused by the chemicals used. Keeping a proper track of all these risks is crucial to meet the desired quality of the drug, hence a number of sensors are used for the assimilation of enormous amounts of data from different departments that help in managing, controlling, and supervising everything that takes place, initiating a sequence response for better efficacy and control, which will eventually reduce the production cost, minimize waste, and allow for better control.}

While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.}

To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities.}

Industry 4.0 is becoming recognised as a unique industrial paradigm. It is predicated on the widespread adoption of communication and information technology, which would lead to improved organisational performance and flexibility. The incorporation of Industry 4.0 is the true game-changer in terms of flexibility and customisation. Manufacturers may utilise this technology to build digital twins of items used by consumers in the real world. The digital twin gets real-time information from sensors on the actual objects. Manufacturers benefit from digital twin and simulation technology, including predictive maintenance and making errors easier and faster to rectify. This paper discusses Industry 4.0 and its Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) capability. Different dimensions and technologies of Industry 4.0 Practices for improving FMS performance are studied,d and then discusses several flexible approaches using Industry 4.0 technologies are. One of the most significant benefits of adopting virtual infrastructure maintained by a service provider is improved flexibility. Cloud services allow auto-scaling, which means that the underlying computer resources automatically adjust to changing utilisation rates. Industry 4.0 increases production flexibility, allowing a facility to respond to market changes quickly. A plant control system automatically varies output depending on shifting utility rates, lowering production costs. Industry 4.0 offers some incredible benefits and has gone a long way in the last several years.}

abstract = {Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the largest electronics market for hardware production due to its fast evolving application space. However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing.}

abstract = {The implementation of Industry 4.0 is usually built around core technologies that integrate different complementary hardware and software to coordinate activities within and across the company's borders. These technologies can operate as platforms, becoming the base of technology integration in the digital transformation journey. However, the specialized literature has not yet addressed Industry 4.0 technologies from a system view by considering the types of platforms involved. Rather, most Industry 4.0 technologies are considered singular entities of digital transformation. Thus, we aim to define which and how Industry 4.0 technologies can operate as platforms. We propose four types of platforms that support Industry 4.0 features: (i) Networked Manufacturing Operations platforms; (ii) Vertical Integration platforms; (iii) End-to-End Engineering platforms; (vi) Horizontal Integration platforms. We adopt a Boundary-Spanning (BS) perspective to analyze technologies as Industry 4.0 platforms using four BS activities: information collection and processing, external representation; task coordination; and knowledge transformation. We employ a multiple-case approach by scrutinizing 40 cases and selecting seven in which Industry 4.0 technologies are used as platforms. Although only the internet of things and cloud-based systems are conceived as technology platforms in practice, we show that Industry 4.0 can embrace other technologies as platforms that contribute to building cyber-physical systems. We suggest that some of these technologies can operate either as stand-alone or platforms, depending on how their use is designed in the digital transformation process for Industry 4.0 implementation. We provide a framework explaining platform layering as a value chain for these technologies.}

abstract = {Ensuring privacy and security in the aerospace industry's digital twin (DT) applications is of utmost importance, particularly when sensitive data collected by aerospace assets is shared with remote servers for simulation purposes. Moreover, protecting the security of DT data retrieved from cloud servers in response to data user requests presents a significant challenge. Existing literature proposes various authentication schemes; however, their high communication and computation overhead make them impractical for providing efficient security. To address these concerns, we introduce BPDATA (an improved version of Son et al.'s and Thakur et al.'s scheme), a secure authentication scheme for cloud-based DT platforms, leveraging blockchain technology to preserve privacy. BPDATA facilitates the secure sharing of sensitive data through cloud computing while ensuring data verifiability and integrity through blockchain integration. We use BAN logic and informal security analysis to demonstrate BPDATA's resilience against discrete attacks, outperforming contemporary schemes with lower computation and communication costs. Compared to the scheme proposed by Son et al., BPADTA demonstrated superior performance in terms of computation cost, requiring only 178.297 ms, and communication cost, amounting to 5184 bits. Additionally, BPADTA effectively countered attacks targeting stolen smart devices, anonymity, and untraceability. Furthermore, we employ Raspberry Pi to evaluate the performance of BPDATA, validating its efficiency and suitability for real-world implementation in the aerospace industry.}

abstract = {This article presents an overview and analysis of the key cybersecurity problems, challenges and requirements to be addressed in the future, which we derived through 63 interviews with European stakeholders from security-critical sectors including Open Banking, Supply Chain, Privacy-preserving Identity Management, Security Incident Reporting, Maritime Transport, Medical Data Exchange, and Smart Cities. We show that common problems, challenges and requirements across these sectors exist in relation to building trust, implementing privacy and identity management including secure and useable authentication, building resilient systems, standardisation and certification, achieving security and privacy by design, secure and privacy-compliant data and information sharing, and government regulations. Our results also indicate cybersecurity trends and allow to derive directions for future research and innovation activities that will be of high importance for Europe.}
