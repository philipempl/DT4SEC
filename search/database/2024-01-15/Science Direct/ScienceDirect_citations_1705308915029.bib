abstract = {This article presents a systematic review that assesses the implication of Construction 4.0 from both a narrow perspective centred on technology adaptation, and a broader perspective that includes the implications of Construction 4.0 on society, environment, governance, and technology itself (referred to as ‘SEGT dimensions’). The review draws on a systematic selection and analysis of 131 primary sources, including peer-reviewed articles, books, and chapters published between 2016 and 2023. The analysis of the literature consistently reveals a discernible pattern: (i) a notable gap between theoretical propositions and practical implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies, processes, and strategies; (ii) a range of barriers hindering the effective adoption of this transformative paradigm such as significant upfront costs associated with integrating Construction 4.0 technologies, a shortage of skilled personnel adept in utilizing these technologies, inadequate regulatory frameworks, hesitancy among construction leadership, and a deep-seated aversion to change within the industry; and, (iii) a lack of understanding in the policy and scholarly community about the impact of Construction 4.0 on the SEGT dimensions. The article warns for unfounded technocratic optimism about Construction 4.0; calls for a holistic application of this ‘new’ paradigm and refrain from cherry-picking ‘cheap and easy’ technologies and applications; and suggests that the construction industry may be able to leapfrog the ‘4.0’ revolution and directly embrace a ‘5.0’ approach by incorporating a human-centric perspective and focusing on how technology and automation can help address the central challenges of the 21st century.}

Its service-based approach enables collaboration and data exchange on higher level, with better efficiency and parallel decreasing costs. Also manufacturing environments can benefit from cloud technology and better fulfill fast changes in market demands, by applying diverse cloud deployment models and by virtualizing manufacturing processes and assets into services. As cloud becomes the basis of most innovative manufacturing IT systems, its future role in Cyber-physical Production Systems has to be properly investigated, as their interoperability will play a role of vital importance. In this paper, after a brief introduction to cloud criticality and cloud-based manufacturing, the mutual conceptual similarities in modelling distributed industrial services of two of the major standardization frameworks for industrial Internet architectures are presented: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) and the Reference Architectural Model Industrie (RAMI 4.0). It is also introduced how their integration feasibility finds a strong affinity in specifications of the Open Connectivity Unified Architecture, a service-oriented architecture candidate to the standardization of Industrial Internet of Things based manufacturing platforms. Finally, the preliminary architecture of a prototype Smart Factory is presented as a case study.}

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on decision-making and how it must be adapted in order to truly benefit from the advantages brought by these technologies. This paper is thus intended to give more enlightenment on the subject, with evidence brought from the textile and clothing industry. Following this objective, a systematic literature review of research articles associated with decision-making in the Industry 4.0 era is performed with a focus on the textile and clothing industry. Articles were retrieved from the Scopus database, and the selection procedure resulted in 61 research papers. Moreover, a content analysis was performed using tables and graphs featuring quantitative results which are grounded on the proposed taxonomy. This study permits to identify some decision-making trends such as data-driven, real-time, decentralized, integrated, and sustainable decision-making. Following these decision-making trends and technologies brought by Industry 4.0, we discuss the keys for a competitive textile and clothing industry of the future. Finally, challenges facing the industry are presented following two aspects including digitalization and Industry 4.0 technologies implementation as well as environmental and social responsibility.}

In the existing literature, scholars focus on a local dot, such as: technology, function, elements and application based on IIP. However, there is a lack of an overall framework to study the top-level planning of IIP implementation from a systematic perspective. Moreover, there are few studies on the detailed path and steps of IIP implementation in a specific industry. The research objective is to study the general model, reference architecture, service evaluation index system, implementation path, application verification, etc. for IIP which meets the needs of industry on the basis of existing theory and industrial practice, and to provide reference for government and industry planning, design, implementation and promotion of IIP. From a case study, the comprehensive performance rate of comprehensive ability for IIP in a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry enterprise is calculated. It can reflect the comprehensive ability for IIP in enterprise from the ability of the IIP’s resource management, platform technology, industrial application, and etc. In addition, the general model, reference architecture, implementation path and service evaluation system of IIP can improve the enterprise's resource management ability, platform service ability, industrial application ability, and enhance the core value of the enterprise and increase benefits.}

abstract = {The goal of managing smart cities and societies is to maximize the efficient use of finite resources while enhancing the quality of life. To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion. The goal of this research is to offer a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of smart city and society management, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that require further investigation and consideration. IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, IoD, IoV, and hybrid models are the seven key emerging developments in information technology that, in this paper, are considered to categorize the state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the Conventional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are the most commonly used ML method in the publications. According to research, the majority of papers are about smart cities' power and energy management. Furthermore, most papers have concentrated on improving only one parameter, where the accuracy parameter obtains the most attention. In addition, Python is the most frequently used language, which was used in 69.8% of the papers.}

Since many business areas can benefit from it, Big Data Analytics as a research topic faces multiple challenges. These ones are: fundamental understanding of models, architectures, security, privacy, but also data science and mentality to accommodate big data-driven decisions. This is argued by a series of facts such as: inference from multiple data sources, observation measuring, missing events and surrogate variables, incomplete information. Thus, this chapter aims to present a broad overview of the most common methods and techniques, including processing data platforms, used for analytics applied to large volume of unstructured, semistructured, and structured data coming with high velocity. Moreover, the tutorial character of this material helps to develop some capabilities in analyzing small data, to be followed up with massive amounts of data.}

Shared mobility is changing the way we choose our travel mode, from just owning a car to e-hailing, car-sharing, and other relevant mobility solutions. There is a growing interest of car manufacturers (original equipment manufacturers or OEMs) in car-sharing as an expansion strategy. Similarly, blockchain technology is seen as another disruptive technology, which can potentially change how the data is stored and accessible via its immutable, transparent, and trustworthy features. Motivated by these two current trends, this paper aims to explore how blockchain and IoT technologies together can drive shared mobility forward. We have presented a high-level architecture for a blockchain-IoT-based platform for promoting shared mobility combining car-sharing and car-leasing. We also demonstrated a prototype implemented from the OEM’s point of view by developing a blockchain-IoT-based platform streamlining car-sharing and leasing processes by taking into consideration of primary stakeholders (such as OEMs, a peer-to-peer car-sharing provider, leasing company and insurance provider as well as public authorities). This work also demonstrates that the design of such an integrated platform depends on the right balance between the key design principles (such as security and privacy, authenticity, traceability and reliability, scalability, and interoperability) in the context of car-sharing platforms.}

Increasing demand for high-quality, innovative texture-building foods, consumer requirements for customized products (i.e., fat, sugar, and micronutrient content), and the limited availability of ingredients and services are pressuring the business industry to use innovative technology to allow a more sustainable food supply. People need a successful approach for potential industrial technologies, and one of the key elements of the industry is Sustainable Food Smart Manufacturing Technology (SFIMT). Advanced methods and techniques are needed to select the appropriate alternate for SFIMT technologies. This paper summarizes technology in food processing and presents a modern framework to guide potential assessments. An innovative empirical evaluation method is proposed to provide several criteria for recognizing the suitability of different food technology for future SFIMT systems.

How can we change the current curriculum to reflect these technological innovations? How can we help the new generation to develop not only left-brain skills but also right-brain skills? The Netherlands is the second largest food exporter in the world after the United States and the agricultural related exports generated €45 Billion in 2018 for the economy. R&D in Dutch companies and innovation in universities in the Netherlands play an important and active role in this context. In this paper, we provide a general framework for supporting education in the context of Industry 4.0. We adopt the case study of Wageningen University at which we were actively involved in designing and customizing academic courses related to Industry 4.0. Wageningen University, which has the highest rank in the field of Agriculture & Forestry according to influential university rankings and has a rank 59 according to Times Higher Education, is traditionally a life science university but has taken also an active strategy for aligning with the developments in IT and Artificial Intelligence. Apart from the content-wise shift, skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving are addressed by applying project-based evaluations.

For example, how does an AI-capable adversary impact the cyber kill chain? Does AI benefit the attacker more than the defender? What are the most significant AI threats facing organizations today and what will be their impact on the future? In this study, we explore the threat of offensive AI on organizations. First, we present the background and discuss how AI changes the adversary’s methods, strategies, goals, and overall attack model.

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) based techniques are playing a major role in effective utilization of the computing resources and offering Quality of Service (QoS). Based on the customer’s application requirements, several cloud computing-based paradigms i.e., edge computing, fog computing, mist computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), cybertwin, and industry 4.0 have been evolved. These paradigms collaborate to offer customer-centric services with the backend of cloud server/data center. In brief, cloud computing has been emerged with respect to the above-mentioned paradigms to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) for the users. In particular, ML techniques are the motivating factor to backend the cloud for emerging paradigms, and ML techniques are essentially enhancing the usages of these paradigms by solving several problems of scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, load balancing, Virtual Machine (VM) migration, offloading, VM mapping, energy optimization, workload prediction, device monitoring, etc. However, a comprehensive survey focusing on multi-paradigm integrated architectures, technical and analytical aspects of these paradigms, and the role of ML techniques in emerging cloud computing paradigms are still missing, and this domain needs to be explored. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first survey that investigates the emerging cloud computing paradigms integration considering the most dominating problem-solving technology i.e., ML. This survey article provides a comprehensive summary and structured layout for the vast research on ML techniques in the emerging cloud computing paradigm. This research presents a detailed literature review of emerging cloud computing paradigms: cloud, edge, fog, mist, IoT, SDN, cybertwin, and industry 4.0 (IIoT) along with their integration using ML. To carry out this study, majorly, the last five years (2017-21) articles are explored and analyzed thoroughly to understand the emerging integrated architectures, the comparative study on several attributes, and recent trends. Based on this, research gaps, challenges, and future trends are revealed.}

CPSs can be defined as systems which collect the information from the physical environment using sensors and communication channels, analyze it using controllers and affect the physical environment and relevant processes through actuators to achieve specific goal during their operation. Compared with the mechatronic systems, CPSs consist of integrated components/subsystems and can be also interconnected with other CPSs. In oil and gas engineering system, transformative technologies have been used for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational capabilities. The acceleration of the construction of intelligent pipeline systems has triggered an upsurge of research on information security issues of key infrastructures, also poses higher challenges to inherently safer design based on information security risks. Based on bibliometric and knowledge map, the existing “Information Physics” crossed domain security threats are analyzed, and seven new security threat models are systematically summarized for information security risk-based safety design. However, there are few researches at present on how to establish inherent safety principles for a CPS system. The result of the paper is increased awareness of new security-related risks that threaten oil and gas infrastructures and of the growing importance of considering safety-security interdependencies.}

This paper explores a novel method of bringing the factory floor data into an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment and visualizing real-time machine analytics through Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) based smart devices. The factory floor data from selective machines at a Volvo Group plant was integrated with IIoT and visualized in real-time through the use of AR-enabled devices such as an iPad and a HoloLens headset. The configuration process for the server and IIoT environment was automated through a software solution, and the performance and feasibility of spatial anchors were evaluated by testing accuracy, triggering times, and latency of data. The results displayed promising applications of AR/MR on factory floors for real-time machine data visualization and associated troubleshooting.}

It is also evident that AI has a huge role to play in emerging and future applications and will be increasingly used in mission-critical and time-sensitive applications such as remote surgeries, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. To satisfy the latency, security and privacy requirements that such applications require, AI which has gained its merit by utilising resource-heavy cloud infrastructure, needs to perform well in resource-constrained environments at the network edge. To address this need, this paper characterises the cloud-to-thing continuum and provides an architecture for enabling AI in fully edge-based scenarios. In addition, the paper provides strategies to tackle the communication inefficiencies that arise from the distributed nature of fully edge-based scenarios. Performance improvements exhibited by these strategies in state-of-the art research is presented, as well as directions where further advancements can be made.

Increased connectivity of Operational Technology (OT) exacerbates cyber risks because Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are becoming exposed to the Internet. These exposures are often done inadvertently through misconfigurations as additional network devices come online. Attack surface management (ASM) platforms can be used to identify vulnerabilities by performing external network discovery over the Internet using web spiders. These web spiders enable big data analytics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as identifiable information of Internet-exposed equipment are archived in searchable databases that are made publicly available. There are a multitude of ASM service providers on the market. This study was conducted to evaluate several commonly known tools to determine the aggregate attack surface of control systems. Queries were crafted by targeting commonly known manufacturers and communication protocols found in OT networks. Identified devices were that categorized based on technology types. Each query was replicated between several tools to target identical ICS equipment. Findings in this paper suggested a significant variance in the exposures discovered by each tool, but unique contributions were identified for each tool when a merged attack surface was derived. Therefore, all tools should be used in aggregate.}

Authentication mechanisms between 6LoWPAN-based constrained devices are an important criterion for establishing secure connections against potential attacks, regardless of the size and capabilities of these devices. Therefore, developing authentication protocols that match the capabilities of 6LoWPAN devices is urgently needed. There is a conspicuous gap in the comprehensive 6LoWPAN Authentication and Key Agreement protocols (AKA) survey, encompassing End-to-End and Machine-to-Machine authentication paradigms. This study provides an innovative perspective that distinguishes it from existing authentication studies to fill this gap and comprehensively analyze AKA-based 6LoWPAN protocols to shed light on the field. A comprehensive survey of AKA protocols for 6LoWPAN examined their suitability within wireless sensor networks and the broader IoT context. This comparative assessment is based on critical factors such as lightweight cryptography solutions, threats, countermeasures, formal and informal security verification techniques and operating systems, and simulations. Additionally, a framework is introduced to facilitate the design of AKA protocols to provide a foundation for new researchers in the field while highlighting key open issues and proposing future research endeavors. Our survey aims to provide benchmark references to help researchers and application developers conduct further research.}

We analyse a sample of 174 manufacturing SMEs operating in Italy. Our results illustrate the distinguishing traits of the knowledge search paths required to implement Industry 4.0 technologies in an SME manufacturing setting. In particular, they indicate that the recognition of digital opportunities in both product design and manufacturing processes require a depth of collaboration in the innovation process to capture firm and industry-specific company needs and to create mutual trust among the parties. Conversely, digital opportunities in the realm of product/service platforms require a breadth of search for SMEs to invest in different information technology layers to support the digitalisation of a product. We also find that all three groups of digital opportunities positively influence the extent of adoption of information and digital technologies (e.g., IoT, big data analytics, simulation). Our findings bring finer-grained evidence on how digital opportunities are linked with the adoption of the different types of Industry 4.0 technologies, reflecting the peculiar traits of manufacturing SMEs. Moreover, they show managers how to set specific collaboration strategies with the ecosystem according to the digital opportunities they are willing to pursue.}

This paper aims at providing non-iterative and scalable decentralized energy management for multi-integrated natural gas-electricity systems with uncertain wind power. An operation space projection transformation method is proposed to reformulate the electricity and natural gas system operation problems for constructing equivalent feasible operation space with the optimality information contained. Accordingly, the proposed decentralized management is privacy-preserving, low-complex, and globally optimal. Moreover, the mathematical proof of the optimality of the reformulated problem is provided. In addition to privacy protection, trust issues are taken into account. Blockchain is applied to safeguard the proposed decentralized management against potential malicious behaviours. We introduce how the proposed decentralized management is embedded in the consensus process of the blockchain. The potential of the projection transformation method in the digital twin application is analyzed. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized energy management method. The synergistic effect and robustness of the proposed operation model are embodied, while the computational accuracy and performance of the non-iterative solution technique are validated.}

abstract = {Urbanisation is leading to a concentration of growing city populations that contribute significantly to economic growth, while becoming epicentres of waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and food consumption. Nutrient smart city circular economy is currently an understudied intersection of growing city populations of food consumers, nutrient recovery technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), and agriculture. Meanwhile, machine learning has exploded with popularity over the years, with many circular economy literatures examining its usefulness in its predictive qualities to support management, optimisation, and recovery of useful resources from organic waste. This review paper examines advancements in machine learning for macronutrient recovery in city organic waste systems for a circular economy. The use of ML will greatly improve the scalability, transparency, productivity and accuracy of nutrient: recovery technologies, logistics, dissemination, and reuse. ML can also be combined with hardware to automate tedious waste separation, recovery and agricultural tasks using drones, hydroponics and satellites. Meanwhile, crop yields, nutrient demand-supply efficiencies, food security, environmental soil monitoring, and prosumer involvement could all increase. However, ML applications for urine, anaerobic digestion and prosumer economics are lacking.}

Industry 4.0 is, however, still in the state of infancy and conceptual state wherein it is not clear as to how to incorporate many dynamic technological concepts in different sectors. Previous studies have conceptually delineated the benefits, challenges, and CSFs of Industry 4.0, however, there is yet to be an empirical study that critically examines the differences in benefits, challenges, and critical success factors (CSFs) of Industry 4.0 in both manufacturing and service industries and rank them. This study through an online survey captures the view of senior management professionals who have experience in Industry 4.0 implementation in major companies in Asia, Europe, and North America. 96 senior management professionals participated in this study through an online survey. The qualitative data on benefits and challenges were analysed using thematic analyses. The quantitative data on critical success factors were ranked using the normalisation of the mean to find the most important factors. Further agreement analysis was conducted in the manufacturing and service sectors for the CSFs. This study identifies the top five benefits and challenges in the manufacturing and service industries. The CSFs for Industry 4.0 was put forward and ranked in both the manufacturing and service industries.}

To ensure business survivability during the current and post-COVID-19 era, it is crucial to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to renovate traditional manufacturing activities. The fifth industrial revolution, Industry 5.0 (I5.0), and artificial intelligence (AI) offer the overwhelming potential to build an inclusive digital future by ensuring supply chain (SC) resiliency and sustainability. Accordingly, this research aims to identify, assess, and prioritize the AI-based imperatives of I5.0 to improve SC resiliency. An integrated and intelligent approach consisting of Pareto analysis, the Bayesian approach, and the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was developed to fulfill the objectives. Based on the literature review and expert opinions, nine AI-based imperatives were identified and analyzed using Bayesian-BWM to evaluate their potential applicability. The findings reveal that real-time tracking of SC activities using the Internet of Things (IoT) is the most crucial AI-based imperative to improving a manufacturing SC’s survivability. The research insights can assist industry leaders, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders in dealing with the impacts of large-scale SC disruptions in the post-COVID-19 era.}

Nowadays, IoT is assimilated into various medical devices and equipment, leading to the progression of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Therefore, various IoMT-based healthcare applications are deployed and used in the day-to-day scenario. Traditionally, machine learning (ML) models use centralized data compilation and learning that is impractical in pragmatic healthcare frameworks due to rising privacy and data security issues. Federated Learning (FL) has been observed as a developing distributed collective paradigm, the most appropriate for modern healthcare framework, that manages various stakeholders (e.g., patients, hospitals, laboratories, etc.) to carry out training of the models without the actual exchange of sensitive medical data. Consequently, in this work, the authors present an exhaustive survey on the security of FL-based IoMT applications in smart healthcare frameworks. First, the authors introduced IoMT devices, their types, applications, datasets, and the IoMT security framework in detail. Subsequently, the concept of FL, its application domains, and various tools used to develop FL applications are discussed. The significant contribution of FL in deploying secure IoMT systems is presented by focusing on FL-based IoMT applications, patents, real-world FL-based healthcare projects, and datasets. A comparison of FL-based security techniques with other schemes in the smart healthcare ecosystem is also presented. Finally, the authors discussed the challenges faced and potential future research recommendations to deploy secure FL-based IoMT applications in smart healthcare frameworks.}

Within all areas of robotics, the demand for collaborative and more flexible systems is rising as well. The level of desired collaboration and increased flexibility will only be reached if the systems are developed as a whole, e.g. perception, reasoning and physical manipulation. The rising need for collaborative robots in the automation industry is acting as a driver for this market and is expected to serve as a market opportunity for future growth. However, at the same time especially smaller companies have difficulties to formulate a concrete vision and strategies for the uptake of robotics, finding skilled workforce to develop and deploy the robot systems and/or work in the manufacturing industry. A number of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) have been developed to enhance the knowledge and technology transfer from laboratories to factory floors, mitigating the skills gap and supporting the formulation of innovation ecosystems with the specific focus on small and medium-sized companies around Europe. The main aim of this paper is to introduce the concept and approach taken in H2020 TRINITY-project that aims to develop a Robotics Innovation Hub focused on Agile Production.

abstract = {Modern business is increasingly adopting fully-digital workflows composed of complementary services (in terms of infrastructures, software, networks, data and devices) from different domains, hence giving rise to complex and heterogeneous digital chains. The substantial fragmentation in service operation and ownership between these domains impacts cybersecurity operations, by hindering a coherent and cooperative defense strategy for the entire chain. As a result, this situation gives attackers more opportunity to move laterally within the chain once they have found and compromised the weakest link. A ground-breaking evolution of legacy cybersecurity processes is necessary towards collaborative and adaptive models that fit the dynamic, agile, and heterogeneous nature of federated environments. In this paper, we elaborate on the necessary convergence between complementary workflows for response, analysis, and intelligence, by considering the peculiarity of these operations and the relevant threat scenario. Our analysis points out the main research challenges to fill the existing gap between management and protection practice for digital service chains. Moreover, we outline a reference architecture that combines such workflows. The objective is to foster researchers to broaden the scope of their work, in order to address open security issues for modern business and computing paradigms.}

Industry 4.0 readiness models are worthy methods to aid manufacturing organizations in tracking the development of their businesses and operations. Nevertheless, there are different Industry 4.0 readiness models; no work has yet analyzed Industry 4.0 readiness degree and causal effects relationships using fuzzy cognitive maps. This paper proposes an Industry 4.0 readiness model that consists of readiness requirements obtained from the literature and validated through a mixed-method approach, including literature reviews and questionnaires. To validate the proposed Industry 4.0 readiness model, the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis methods are used. Fuzzy Cognitive Map is utilized to assess readiness, identify relevant concepts to improve readiness degree, implement Industry 4.0, and analyze causal relationships among concepts and dimensions. Through this model and the FCM method, managers can recognize relevant concepts and predict complicated cause-effect relationships among concepts in two states of static and dynamic analyses to increase readiness degree. The paper concludes by emphasizing managerial implications for successful applications in practice as well as future research suggestions on developing the Industry 4.0 readiness model.}

The value of simulation is evident, especially in today’s volatile manufacturing environment, which is influenced by globalization and ever-increasing demands for higher levels of product customization and personalization. Moreover, a significant manufacturing issue is the interoperability and communication among the several simulation tools. To that end, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) framework for simulation and visualization of selected monitored values based on Mixed Reality (MR) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in a cloud-computing environment for intuitive data visualization on smart devices is presented in this paper. As such, in light of the possibilities offered by digital technologies such as CFD simulation, smart factories can gain a competitive advantage because of the low cost, low risk, and the provided useful insights. The range of CFD applications encountered in process manufacturing and engineering varies greatly depending on the industry. Summarizing, this review paper identifies the gaps in current practices, and future trends and challenges to be met on the field are outlined.

The Internet of Things (IoT), sensor-based, is one of the most current advanced tools that can handle appropriate measures to control data operations across manufacturing industries. The demand for predictive machine reliability and quality drives the development of intelligent manufacturing technologies. To this goal, a variety of machine learning algorithms are being studied. Data protection and monitoring is also another concern that is a critical component of the organization. To overcome these issues, the proposed method uses Blockchain Technology (BCT) and Machine Learning to secure the information operations and manage a dataset. Significant data approaches were employed to organize and evaluate the obtained dataset. BCT allows collecting sensor user access data, whereas ML classifiers distinguish between normal and malicious behavior to detect attacks. DoS, DDoS, intrusion, a man in the middle (MitM), brute force, cross-site scripting (XSS), and searching are the attacks detected by BCT. Furthermore, the hybrid prediction technique assessed the fault detection prediction component. The program's quality control was set using non-linear machine learning techniques that represented the complicated world and determined the actual positive rate of the standard control methodology used by the platform. The experimental result shows that the proposed method outperforms empirical metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and response time. The proposed method efficiently provides security between innovative manufacturing transactions.}

One of the aspects of increased requirements for the reliable and safe operation of NPP process control systems is perfecting human-operator information decision support systems. In the paper, an approach is considered in which the operator support information system kernel is a flexible modeling program complex, which, depending on the tasks being solved, can be used as a digital twin or a digital shadow. The digital twin furnishes the past state of the product, the current state, and probable future states, which is especially significant for its use. The paper also discusses methods for assessing the proximity of a physical object and its digital twin based on a consistent and normalized measure of dependence of random vectors.}

I4.0 involves the digital turn of manufacturing companies, changing the way they operate, their business models, and by extension, their interaction with digital players. Nonetheless, the future of I4.0 regarding its interaction with digital players and the phenomenon of uberization has scarcely been examined. Thus, this research adopts a participatory and systemic foresight approach to explore the trajectories of I4.0 in the face of uberization. The study was conducted with a working group of 22 members from academia and practice. Four scenarios and related action plans were produced. The results emphasize that uberization is not necessarily a process to be endured by manufacturers, but it could be chosen or even co-constructed with different actors if manufacturers address key challenges such as rethinking their business models and adapting their factors of production. The scenarios indicate the dynamics of uberization as contingent on technological developments and on industrial policy choices, changes in consumer behavior, and access to multiple funding sources. Finally, the study provides practical implications regarding the dynamics of collaboration between SMEs and large groups, on one hand, and between manufacturing companies and digital players, on the other hand.}

These are seemingly independent technologies, each of them advancing rapidly and impacting the way we live. Can these technologies join forces to bring more to humans? Until now, these technologies have been considered mostly separately, each playing a role in its own field. We also find some research that combines a couple of them like for example multimedia content with networking, leaving out security. Alternatively, research uses security with networking, without giving much consideration to the content. Additionally, multimedia interaction is repeatedly neglected, and multimedia artificial intelligence is considered from a completely different perspective. Our vision is that all of these five technologies are interconnected, and we work with the convergence of all five of them rather than using each independently. When these five technologies converge together, they create what we consider the Digital Twin as we will discuss in this chapter.}

As labor and suppliers shift to digital platforms, interconnection, information transparency, and decentralized choices become ubiquitous. In this sense, Industry 4.0 enables "smart digitalization" in these environments. Many applications exist in two distinct but interrelated areas related to shipbuilding design and shipyard operational performance. New digital tools, such as virtual prototypes and augmented reality, begin to be used in the design phases, during the commissioning/quality control activities, and for training workers and crews. An application relates to using Virtual Prototypes and Augmented Reality during all the design and construction phases. Another application relates to the cybersecurity protection of operational networks that support shipbuilding supply chains that ensures the flow of material and labor to the shipyards. This protection requires a holistic approach to evaluate their vulnerability and understand ripple effects. This paper presents the applications of Industry 4.0 for the areas mentioned above. The first case in shipbuilding design is an example of how the virtual prototype of a ship, together with wearable devices enabling augmented reality, can be used for the quality control of the construction of ship systems. For the second case, we propose developing an artificial intelligence-based cybersecurity supply network framework that characterizes and monitors shipbuilding supply networks and determines ripple effects from disruptions caused by cyberattacks. This framework extends a novel risk management framework developed by Diaz and Smith and Smith and Diaz that considers complex tiered networks.}

Such teams require a dynamic decision framework to allow ICS operators to maintain services during the recovery of full operating capability. There is empirical evidence that static incident response playbooks do not provide enough flexibility in their definition to support situations outside of the scope of their initial definition, and that they have been ignored when cyber incidents have occurred. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with ICS incident response professional identified three main areas of concern: communication, information sharing between knowledge areas, and achieving external buy-in. The Agile Incident Response for Industrial Control Systems (AIR4ICS) framework has been developed to integrate Agile techniques into the Cyber Security domain of incident response. AIR4ICS provides a dynamic approach to improve situational awareness, information sharing, collective decision-making and response flexibility within the unique context of ICS. The techniques used in AIR4ICS were initially shaped by interviews with professionals with experience of protecting ICS, structured using the Scrum methodology, and refined through a series of Cyber Incident Response exercises with Incident Response professionals facing-off against specialist ICS Red Teams. AIR4ICS has resulted in a framework that provides a modular approach that can be adapted to fit the working practices, skillsets and priorities of individual organisations. The framework improves communication, promotes information sharing between knowledge areas, and increases external buy-in. Ultimately, AIR4ICS provides a dynamic decision framework that allows Incident Response Teams to manage uncertainty and unpredictability to reduce the time taken to restore normal operations.}

Given the societal and practical importance of CE and digitalisation, last decade has witnessed a significant increase in academic publication on these topics. Therefore, this study aims to capture the essence of the scholarly work at the intersection of the CE and digital technologies. A detailed analysis of the literature based on emerging themes was conducted with a focus on illuminating the path of CE implementation. The results reveal that IoT and AI play a key role in the transition towards the CE. A multitude of studies focus on barriers to digitalisation-led CE transition and highlight policy-related issues, the lack of predictability, psychological issues and information vulnerability as some important barriers. In addition, product-service system (PSS) has been acknowledged as an important business model innovation for achieving the digitalisation enabled CE. Through a detailed assessment of the existing literature, a viable systems-based framework for digitalisation enabled CE has been developed which show the literature linkages amongst the emerging research streams and provide novel insights regarding the realisation of CE benefits.}

These technologies facilitate working personnel and make it more appealing to complete their duties efficiently and accurately. The main aim of this paper is to understand the concept of Management 4.0, its technologies and applications for proper management systems. As Management 4.0 enhances process control, the chance of human error is reduced, leading to increased efficiency. It enables rapid and intelligent decision-making, reduces costs, accelerates growth, and raises profitability. Management 4.0 technologies and advanced data analytics are helpful to make smart supply chain management well suited to fulfil industry 4.0. Thus, to overcome various obstacles and effectively deploy Management 4.0 technologies in manufacturing industries, top management must establish a clear asset performance management plan with the help of process engineers familiar with industrial system failure occurrences and what operators need to improve. Management 4.0 involves advanced technologies, system connectivity, data collection & analysis at the organisation level. Management 4.0 is expected to be a critical component in the long-term survival of any business, either manufacturing or service-providing organisations. This paper explores the development of Management 4.0 and its dimensions and transformations through Management 4.0 perspectives. Finally, the significant role of Management 4.0 for appropriate private management system in manufacturing industries are identified. Organisations require a system that seamlessly meets the company's expectations, consumers, investors, and other stakeholders to remain competitive, and Management 4.0 will enable this. Many businesses strive to integrate technologies and upskill their personnel to adapt to the new job duties and attract more workers with the necessary abilities.}

Urban sensors with different uses vary greatly in hardware structure, communication protocols, data formats, interaction modes, sampling frequencies, data accuracy and service quality, thus posing an enormous challenge to the unified integration and sharing of massive sensor information resources. Consequently, access and data management methods for these multisource heterogeneous urban sensors are extremely important. Additionally, multisource heterogeneous urban sensor access and data management technologies provide strong support for intelligent perception and scientific management at the city scale and can accelerate the construction of smart cities or digital twin cities with virtual reality features. We systematically summarize the related research on these technologies. First, we present a summary of the concepts and applications of urban sensors. Then, the research progress on multisource heterogeneous urban sensor access technologies is analysed in relation to communication protocols, data transmission formats, access standards, access technologies and data transmission technologies. Subsequently, the data management technologies for urban sensors are reviewed from the perspectives of data cleaning, data compression, data storage, data indexing and data querying. In addition, the challenges faced by the technologies above and corresponding feasible solutions are discussed from three aspects, namely, the integration of massive Internet of Things (IoT), computational burden and energy consumption and cybersecurity.

This paper describes the implementation of a smart-factory at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI) aiming at filling the gap in I4.0 related skills development thorough a learning by doing approach, and providing a research platform that could foster collaboration of practitioners and academia on the development and testing of new technologies. The developed factory integrates different production technologies such as additive manufacturing, laser processing and milling, in order to produce a highly customizable item consisting in a TANGRAM game-set, packaged into personalized boxes. The entire factory is coupled with its digital twin, which is fed by an exhaustive monitoring infrastructure composed by vision systems and high precision measurement instruments, allowing to track in real time plant processes. The design has been carried out in order to make the smart factory serving as a mean to face both educational and research challenges at many different levels. As an educational mean, students and professionals have the chance to dive into manufacturing history experiencing both classical automation topics (PLC, MES and SCADA programming, precision axes control and pneumatics), as well as more advanced technologies, typical of the most advanced smart-factories (IoT, vision systems, simulation and digital twin, advanced measuring methods and smart production management systems).

abstract = {Considering the increasing introduction of cyber-physical systems in modern industrial plants, the analysis of systems’ performance pushes for developing a cyber resilience perspective to complement a traditional physical resilience assessment. This point of view becomes central for critical infrastructures, considering the potential societal and economic consequences a disruption may have. This work provides a cyber-resilience simulation-based assessment for a seawater desalination plant and its connected distribution system. For this purpose, a digital twin has been developed. It integrates a MATLAB/Simulink model of the reverse osmosis treatment plant with a georeferenced water distribution network designed in EPANET. Four stochastic cyber resilience metrics have been proposed and computed to assess the impact of a successful replay cyber attack. The results exemplify the benefits of cyber-physical simulations to understand the behavior of modern water treatment plants, to identify system's criticalities, and eventually to support decision making by identifying hotspots and prioritizing mitigating actions.}

Nevertheless, the unique features of IoT devices, such as their limited energy capacity, large-scale deployment, and prospective mobility, introduce new challenges and constraints, resulting in unoptimized data gathering. Therefore, as a forthcoming solution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be dispatched as auxiliary devices, and the benefits of their potential are fully exploited, such as movement flexibility, mitigation of IoT communication burden, minimization of data collection (DC) delay, powering IoT devices, and efficient delivery of collected data. The current state-of-the-art has a noticeable gap that hinders the systematic reviews of UAV-based DC schemes. To bridge this gap, this survey provides an extensive analysis of UAV-based DC schemes to light up the topic. We first outline the main characteristics of UAV networks, which have to be considered when designing an efficient UAV-based DC scheme. Also, we highlight the main challenges that, if considered during the data gathering process, can significantly enhance the assistance of UAVs to IoT devices. We then describe various UAV-based DC applications with their key features. Next, our paper comprehensively discusses UAV-based DC schemes according to a proposed taxonomy. Finally, we discuss current problems, difficulties, and potential future directions for UAV-based DC research.}

Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes. Finally, the scope of future research is discussed in detail.}

Although many studies related to this subject were published, including several literature reviews, there is no consensual definition of I4.0. Consequently, there is not a clear understanding of the underlying enabling technologies required to implement it. That makes it more difficult for players to plan a migration strategy. This paper proposes a technological pathway infrastructure from Industry 3.0 (I3.0) to I4.0, based on the analysis of research and academic involvement in this transition process. A bibliometric study was directed to academic work, while field research addressed industry practitioners. The purpose of field research is to understand the impact of the knowledge about the transition from I3.0 up to I4.0. The contribution of this study includes a construct showing the fundamental technology infrastructure to pave the way from I3.0 up to I4.0. Furthermore, it reveals the transition of manufacturing paradigm from I3.0 complex, centralized, monolithic architecture and physical Supply Chain to a modular, distributed, collaborative, and product-service-oriented I4.0 architecture.}

For the past decade, Industry 4.0 has become the basis for building competitive advantage for business operations. The key technologies of Industry 4.0 are implemented in enterprises of various industries. This paper focuses on presenting the results of research on the influence of the Industry 4.0 concept on the operations of enterprises that are implementing smart manufacturing (SM) projects. The paper analyses the following areas of influence of projects on the enterprises’ operations: productivity, agility and speed, quality, competitiveness and enterprise value, profitability, staff reduction, delivery improvements, vertical and horizontal integration, resource savings, reduction of operating costs, technology adaptability and quality of machine operations. The paper belongs to the research paper category. The research tool was a questionnaire. The research was carried out in the segment of steel enterprises in Poland. The results of the presented research belong to pilot research of a segment of steel industry in Poland. The main conclusion of the study is that implementation of Industry 4.0 in the Polish steel sector had a positive influence on many factors strictly connected with the innovativeness of the company. Especially, the implementation of this conception in the steel sector leads to an increase in the quality of the product and the possibility to achieve a good level of customization of the product. Those factors are very important for the steel sector potential to succeed on the competitive market. The individual SM projects that were evaluated were a form of case study. The participants of the research were employees in managerial positions and operating technological installations in steel sector enterprises. In the opinion of the surveyed (79 people), depending on the type and scope of changes implemented in the company in the direction of Industry 4.0, decision-makers expect a higher quality of processes and products, the ability to meet customer requirements—the direction of the personalization of products and services, agility and flexibility of performed operations with the use of smart technology and accuracy and precision of performance higher than in the case of manual human activities.}

It has shown great potential in some application areas and we are witnessing evidence of new approaches where millions or even billions of IoT devices can contribute collectively to achieve a common goal of machine learning through federation. However, existing approaches are primarily suitable for single-task learning with a single objective in a single task owner where it is assumed that the majority of devices contributing to federated learning have a similar design or device type and restrictions. We argue that the true potential of federated learning can only be realised if we have a dynamic and open ecosystem where devices, industrial units, machine manufacturers, non-governmental agencies, and governmental entities can contribute toward learning for multiple tasks and objectives in a crowdsourced manner. In this article, we propose a multi-level framework that shows how federated learning, IoT, and crowdsourcing can come hand-in-hand with each other to make a robust ecosystem of multi-level federated learning for Industry 4.0. This helps build future intelligent applications for Industry 4.0 such as predictive maintenance and fault detection for systems in smart manufacturing units. In addition, we also highlight several use-cases of multi-level federated learning where this approach can be implemented in Industry 4.0. Moreover, if the approach is implemented successfully, besides enhancement in performance it will also help towards a greater common goal e.g. UN Sustainable Goal No 13 i.e. reduction in carbon footprint.}

Most often, these systems have hard-coded cases to achieve a specific set of actions -or to assure the safety of the operations. The hard-coding makes the use complicated to re-deploy a system for different tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to have a flexible framework, which can generate a plan based on an intuitive description with system constraints, while satisfying all safety conditions. In this work, we propose Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)-based autonomy framework for smart-manufacturing systems. Specifically, we describe a general technique for formulating problems using LTL specifications. The use of LTL enables us to specify a manufacturing scenario (e.g. assembly), along with system constraints, as well as assured autonomy. Based on the given LTL formulation, a safe solution satisfying all constraints can be generated using a satisfiability solver. To eliminate the exhaustive and exponential nature of the solver, we reduced the exploration space with a divide and conquer approach in a receding horizon, which brings dramatic improvements in time and enables our solution for real-world applications. Our experimental evaluations indicated that our solution scales linearly as the problem complexity increases. We showcased the feasibility of our approach by integrating TLbased autonomy with the simulations of Gantry robot in Siemens NX Mechatronics Concept Designer and TIA Portal (PLCSIM Advanced) for Siemens S7-1500 TCPU connected to Sinamics drives.}

Second, the prototype of a Service-oriented Digital Twin, which leverage on a flexible ontology-oriented knowledge structure and on augmented reality combined to a vocal interaction system for an intuitive knowledge retrieval and fruition, has been designed and developed to deliver this manufacturing knowledge. Two test-beds, complimentary for the problems in practice (the former on the maintenance-production interface in a large enterprise, the latter majorly focused in production and setups in a small and medium enterprise), show the significant benefits in terms of time, costs and process quality, thus validating the approach proposed.

CTDE empowers sharing knowledge from agents in different environments for updating a shared model. A wide range of applications is supported through CTDE in MARL, such as self-driving vehicle coordination, traffic lights synchronization, or cooperation in various aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT), including resource management. Despite the drawbacks of relying on a central authority for handling model updates, incorporating multiple sources of data raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the process. For instance, participating agents could provide data in the favor of their experiences to shift the model towards certain behaviors. Similarly, sending falsified data for updates could lead to adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to integrate the Ethereum Blockchain technology to handle model updates in the CTDE paradigm by achieving decentralized storage and consensus mechanism for model updates. In the literature, there exist multiple efforts that propose using reinforcement learning (RL) on Blockchain; however, none of them have considered updating MARL of CTDE on-chain, allowing transparent and auditable record of the training process. Therefore, we propose LearnChain, a framework that offers an integration between the CTDE mechanism and a Consortium Blockchain built between authorized participants, thus avoiding gas costs. At the core of LearnChain, RL is integrated with Quorum, offering separate smart contracts for deployment, data handling with incentive mechanisms, training, target update, and inference. Based on a real use-case entailing management of Vehicular Edge Computing tasks through multi-agent synchronization, we implement LearnChain and evaluate its performance and cost in different settings. Our results show the ability to improve learning from shared experiences and to adapt to environment changes on the Quorum BlockChain.}

Safety-critical systems, such as planes, are at risk because cyber-information cannot be provably tied to a specific physical part instance (e.g., impeller). This paper presents promising initial work showing that using piezoelectric sensors to measure impedance identities of parts may serve as a physically unclonable function that can produce unclonable part instance identities. When one of these impedance identities is combined with cyber-information and signed using existing public key infrastructure approaches, it creates a provable binding of cyber-information to a specific part instance. Our initial results from experimentation with traditionally and additively manufactured parts indicate that it will be extremely expensive and improbable for an attacker to counterfeit a part that replicates the impedance signature of a legitimate part.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is a technology-driven digital transformation to enable data-driven decision-making based on real-time data to enhance the competitiveness of traditional manufacturing. Moving forward, adopting Industry 4.0 is an evident requirement for manufacturers to remain competitive. Currently, in the early stages of adoption in most industries and countries, there is an evident lack of foundational Industry 4.0 knowledge among decision-makers. There are few studies on the adoption of Industry 4.0; however, they focus on specific domains like cloud computing, virtual reality, IoT, etc., and are primarily set in developed countries. This research proposes a multi-stage hybrid analytic approach whereby the research model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The SEM results were used as inputs for the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine significant predictors for the adoption of Industry 4.0 in Indian manufacturing industries. A comprehensive sample of 350 responses from various Indian manufacturers was collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the factors viz. Software Infrastructure (SI), System Flexibility (SF), Operational Accuracy (OA), and the Technical Capabilities (TC) play a dominant role in the successful adoption intentions of Industry 4.0 in India. Manufacturers from India and other emerging economies will benefit from the findings of this study by concentrating and improving on the dominant adoption factors of Industry 4.0. Concluding, we discuss the study’s results and derive lessons learned for stakeholders, including managers, consultants, policymakers, and regulatory authorities.}

abstract = {The digital transformation of design and construction has been chaotic and ad-hoc. This has necessitated the need for clear guidelines and strategic frameworks to guide designers and builders. This paper aims to develop a strategic framework for assessing the digital maturity of design and construction in the Australian context. This research is conducted in three phases using a bottom-up approach. The early, transition and mature stage characteristics of digital maturity are first identified using a systematic literature review. Subsequently, the characteristics are mapped to the New South Wales (NSW) Government's ten-point commitment to the construction sector to propose a conceptual framework, which is then applied to understand the current digital maturity of design and construction in NSW through an industry-wide questionnaire survey. The paper reveals a lack of clear understanding of the stages of digital maturity and proposes a strategic framework for digitalisation of design and construction (SFDDC) to guide systematic improvement. The SFDDC is a decadal framework that considers feasible levels of digitalisation of design and construction and is characterised by a series of baseline technologies and minimum targets at each stage. It is expected to be a catalyst towards digitally driven processes and integrated functional digital twins.}

As a result, some Industry 3.0 technologies are identified as prerequisites for the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Taking into account this information, a previously proposed Key Performance Indicator is enhanced to better assessing the degree of automation and digitalization of a company, and it is proposed as a novel diagnostic tool for measuring the degree of readiness to implement Industry 4.0. A real-world case study of a metal-mechanical industry company is shown as an application of the proposed diagnostic tool. Additionally, a methodology for implementation of Industry 4.0 in, principally, small and medium-sized enterprises is proposed.}

Industry 5.0 is one of the recent terms to describe this phenomenon, defined as a humanized vision of technological transformations in industry, balancing the current and future needs of the workers and society with the sustainable optimization of energy consumption, materials processing, and product lifecycles. This paper presents a tertiary study of thirty-two literature reviews on Industry 5.0, supported by a bibliometric analysis in the Scopus database. The results show three stages of Industry 5.0 research since 2018, starting with the Industry 4.0 separation. The latest priority is to deploy circular manufacturing strategies supported by human-friendly digitalization capable of anticipating and acting proactively on impacts. Therefore, Industry 5.0 is future-oriented and cross-sectoral, (interactively) diverging from the original configuration of Industry 4.0. For theory, we highlight the findings of recent literature reviews, clarifying the landscape of Industry 5.0 research and suggesting future developments. For practice, this paper presents examples of societal priorities that industries should consider in their digital transformation investments, as crucial as improving economic competitiveness.}

These are continuing to increase in line with urbanisation and climate change, leading to a recognition that the historic paradigm of passive management using centralised infrastructure is insufficient to manage future hazards to our society, environment, and economy. The cross-sector Internet of Things revolution has inspired a new generation of smart stormwater management systems which offer an effective, cost beneficial and adaptive solution to enhance network capacities and reduce hazards. However, despite growing prominence within research, this technology remains under-utilised, in a large part due to fragmented and inconsistent alignment and terminology, obscuring the strategic co-ordination of research. We respond to this through systematically reviewing the terminology, practice and trajectory for smart stormwater management and developing a framework which can be applied to both coordinate and understand the existing research landscape, as well as identifying key research gaps for future development. We find that literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is, or will be, beneficial to stormwater management and that technology has reached partial maturity in terms of quantity management, although this has not yet transferred to water quality. However, research is dominated by proof-of-concept modelling studies, with limited practical application beyond real time control of large assets, individual pilot studies and monitoring. We recommend that future research explores and evidences the substantial benefits likely through expanding current implementation towards a coordinated, decentralised, and optimised catchment-scale approach.}

One consequence of this is that engineering work is becoming open-ended, requiring a new kind of collaboration between engineers and technology. The present chapter argues that this will be based on “capability-focused technology fluency” (CFTF). Technology fluency (TF) requires domain-specific expertise; capability focus (CF), by contrast, involves a general (i.e., not engineering-specific) mindset based on two “metacompetencies”: willingness and ability to update your own knowledge, on the one hand, and willingness and ability to use this knowledge to work effectively with rapid change, novelty and uncertainty, on the other. Developing an understanding of this capability focus is the task of “cyber-psychology” and supporting a “dual-track” approach, which encompasses the growth of not only (technology fluency) TF but of (capability focus) CF as well, is now an important task for engineering organizations preparing for the future of work.}

The purpose is to enable Just-in-Time material transfer on the production shop-floor during manufacturing. A decentralized multi-robot path planning adopts graph neural networks (GNN) in the new proposed CPRMFS. We compare multiple classification algorithms for the mobile robots' action prediction, including proposing a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GNN) under these circumstances. We also extend the research with the enhanced conflict-based search path planning algorithm. Compared with the existing literature, ST-GNN, under the enhanced conflict-based search, could obtain higher accuracy with an average value of 90% under different scenarios. The practical applicability of the proposed system with the further consideration of ST-GNN is further explained as a reference for manufacturing practitioners who looked out on a confrontation of introducing the mobile robot solutions in their manufacturing site with the goal of enhancing the operation processes.}

Recently, unobservable physiological signals (e.g., Electroencephalogram, Photoplethysmogram, Electrocardiogram) as biometrics offer a potential remedy to this problem. In particular, Photoplethysmogram (PPG) measures the change in blood flow of the human body by an optical method. Clinically, researchers commonly use PPG signals to obtain patients' blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and other information to assist in diagnosing heart-related diseases. Since PPG signals contain a wealth of individual cardiac information, researchers have begun to explore their potential in cyber security applications. The unique advantages (simple acquisition, difficult to steal, and live detection) of the PPG signal allow it to improve the security and usability of the authentication in various aspects. However, the research on PPG-based authentication is still in its infancy. The lack of systematization hinders new research in this field. We conduct a comprehensive study of PPG-based authentication and discuss these applications' limitations before pointing out future research directions.}

Interfaces to digital twins are projected to go beyond physical representations to become blueprints for the actual “objects” and an active dashboard for their control. The role and importance of real-time interactive animations presented in an Extended Reality (XR) format will be explored. The need for using game engines, particularly their physics engines and AI within interactive simulated Extended Reality is expanded on. Importing and scanning real-world environments is assumed to become more efficient when using AR. Exporting to VR and AR is recommended to be a default feature. A technology framework for the next generation simulators is presented along with a proposed set of implementation guidelines. The need for more human centric technology approaches, nascent in Industry 4.0, are now central to the emerging Industry 5.0 paradigm; an agenda that is discussed in this research as part of a human in the loop future, supported by DES. The potential role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence is also explored along with an audit trail approach to provide a justification of complex and automated decision-making systems with relation to DES. A technology framework is proposed, which brings the above together and can serve as a guide for the next generation of holistic simulators for manufacturing.}

The present study examines the resilience characteristics at the equipment area of the diverse control methods and their effect on the outage severity of the smart grid using digital twins (DT) simulation technology. The paper presents a machine learning based metric for measuring the resilience of cyber-physical features that considers device-level characteristics, vulnerabilities, and system models.
