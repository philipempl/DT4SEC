abstract = {Industry 4.0 is collaborating directly for the technological revolution. Both machines and managers are daily confronted with decision making involving a massive input of data and customization in the manufacturing process. The ability to predict the need for maintenance of assets at a specific future moment is one of the main challenges in this scope. The possibility of performing predictive maintenance contributes to enhancing machine downtime, costs, control, and quality of production. We observed that surveys and tutorials about Industry 4.0 focus mainly on addressing data analytics and machine learning methods to change production procedures, so not comprising predictive maintenance methods and their organization. In this context, this article presents a systematic literature review of initiatives of predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0, identifying and cataloging methods, standards, and applications. As the main contributions, this survey discusses the current challenges and limitations in predictive maintenance, in addition to proposing a novel taxonomy to classify this research area considering the needs of the Industry 4.0. We concluded that computer science, including artificial intelligence and distributed computing fields, is more and more present in an area where engineering was the dominant expertise, so detaching the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to address Industry 4.0 effectively.}

The pandemic with its travel constraints, price hikes, and economic troubles, reinforced by changing energy markets due to the war in Ukraine is threatening global economic stability. This overall situation has introduced a dramatic step change to the conduct of operations for many manufacturers. On top of that comes the threat of climate change and the ongoing energy and digitalization adjustments that industry will have to make to improve socially responsible and to remain competitive in the face of changing expectations. These Industry 4.0 adjustments introduce a great challenge for the management of multinational companies given the greater range of expectations in its operational jurisdictions. Leadership needs to take stock, re-evaluate their business processes and engage resources not tapped in the past to establish a new foundation on which to remain competitive in the future. Within a rather turbulent world, retirement of experienced staff, the multiplicity of several generations working together with their different attitudes and life styles, posed an additional challenge: the need for skilled and motivated staff to overcome the hurdles. This paper frames these current and future challenges and provides guidance to industry leadership and management to assist in their struggle to meet demands and maintain competitive operations.}

Resilience is the ability of CMS to perform its intended goals in the presence of a deliberate disruptions—cyber-attacks. A more resilient CMS would show reduced failure probability, less disastrous consequences, and a faster recovery from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks. The goal of the work presented in this paper is to identify resilience-increasing mechanisms and provide a framework for their classification. A resilience-increasing mechanism is defined as an action implemented in CMS, aimed to a) reduce the probability of a successful cyber-attack, b) reduce the time to detection of a cyber-attack, c) reduce the adverse effects of a successful cyber-attack, or d) reduce the time to recover from a cyber-attack. A non-exhaustive list of resilience-increasing mechanisms is provided that had been published on peer reviewed publication and applied to the specific context of cyber-manufacturing.}

Smart grid technologies possess innovative tools and frameworks to model the dynamic behaviour of microgrids regardless of their types, structures, etc. Various control and estimation technologies are reviewed for developing dynamic models of smart microgrids. The hierarchical system of a microgrid control consists of three architectural layers, primary, secondary and tertiary, which need to be supported by real-time monitoring and measurement environment of the system variables and parameters. Various control and estimation schemes have been devised to handle the dynamic performance of microgrids in the function of control layers requirement. Firstly, control schemes in the innovative grid environment are evaluated to understand the dynamics of the developed technologies. Six control technologies, linear, non-linear, robust, predictive, intelligent and adaptive, are mainly used to model the control design within the layer(s) regardless of the types of microgrids. Secondly, the estimation technologies are evaluated based on the state of variables, locations and modelling of microgrids that can efficiently support the performance of the controllers and operating microgrids. Finally, a future vision for designing hierarchical and architectural control techniques for the optimal operation of intelligent microgrids is also provided. Therefore, this study will serve as a fundamental conceptual framework to select a perfect optimal design modelling strategy and policy-making decisions to control, monitor and protect the innovative electrical network.}

abstract = {Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) hold a significant proportion in the economy and more than half of employment worldwide. Nowadays, many SMEs are embarking on a digital transformation journey by embracing and deploying the Fourth Industrial Revolution (a.k.a. Industry 4.0) technologies with a vision of the “Factory of the Future”. Factory of the future aims to enhance production by making improvements in three dimensions: plant structure, plant digitization, and plant processes, which cut across many key function areas of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) such as management of product definitions, resource scheduling, order execution and dispatch, production analysis, product quality, and materials track and trace. The technological shift with the Factory of the Future, e.g., the adoption of information, communication, and networking technologies in the form of the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in order to manage interoperability at the factory’s functional levels in real-time, demands a fresh look at the functional aspects of MES as well as the interplays between MES and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and a process control system (e.g., SCADA). The Factory of the Future may lead to hierarchical changes in MES byways of redesigning the value chain for dynamic production and mass personalization scenarios. Deployment of the responsive and adaptive value chain in MES is still state-of-art-issue. The authors will address dynamic interoperability between modular functionalities for end-to-end integration and consider microservices scenarios to form a service-oriented architecture that supports the part of MES in the responsive and adaptive industrial value chain. Primary modules of the manufacturing execution system have been identified from ISA-95 standards and demonstration of end-to-end integration via OPC-UA server/client and PubSub mechanism contributing to the execution of business and manufacturing functions. Each element or activity runs in its own process and provides a microservice; each microservice communicate with other services and form a service-oriented architecture for MES. Finally, a universal framework solution has been proposed for dynamic interoperability, which intends to upgrade the value chain and networking of a conventional industry towards a factory of the future.}

This is a strategic priority of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public policies and global initiatives. The operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. Emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. In this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. Nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. In this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. Internet of Things, digital twins, point clouds, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. We show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. In this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. Thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to Net Zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. To achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant SDGs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies.}

Currently companies face two major problems in this transformation of their IT architectures: 1) There are multiple reference architectures for Industrie 4.0, whose suitability has not been evaluated in a straightforward way. 2) There are no maturity models to objectively assess data-driven IT architectures. In this work we address these problems by providing an overview of Industrie 4.0 features in multiple reference architectures and developing a maturity model for IT architectures for data-driven manufacturing. We first give an overview of the current maturity models with aspects of data-driven manufacturing. Based on this overview we survey three reference architectures for Industrie 4.0: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture, the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0, and the Stuttgart IT Architecture for Manufacturing. We analyze and assess each approach and define maturity levels for data-driven manufacturing to guide companies in the adaption process of Industrie 4.0, as well as criteria for meeting these levels.}

The predominated usage of mobile phones, wearable devices and autonomous vehicles are examples of distributed networks which generate huge amount of data each and every day. The computational power of these devices have also seen steady progression which has created the need to transmit information, store data locally and drive network computations towards edge devices. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a significant role in ensuring security and privacy of such devices. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) with Intrusion Detection Systems have gained great momentum due to their achievement of high classification accuracy. However the privacy and security aspects potentially gets jeopardized due to the need of storing and communicating data to centralized server. On the contrary, Federated Learning (FL) fits in appropriately as a privacy-preserving decentralized learning technique that does not transfer data but trains models locally and transfers the parameters to the centralized server. The present paper aims to present an extensive and exhaustive review on the use of FL in intrusion detection system. In order to establish the need for FL, various types of IDS, relevant ML approaches and its associated issues are discussed. The paper presents detailed overview of the implementation of FL in various aspects of anomaly detection. The allied challenges of FL implementations are also identified which provides idea on the scope of future direction of research. The paper finally presents the plausible solutions associated with the identified challenges in FL based intrusion detection system implementation acting as a baseline for prospective research.}

Combined with it, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a comprehensive Digital Transformation tendency to solve the problems Cloud computing faces. However, the fundamental challenges of energy and latency make deploying IIoT MEC networks difficult. Accordingly, this paper considers the efficient design of time allocation for successful computation probability (SCP) maximization for multiple energy-constrained mobile devices (MD) and multiple antennas access point (AP) in uplink radio frequency energy harvesting (RF EH) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) IIoT network. Specifically, multiple MDs need to receive the energy and compute support of a MEC server placed in a multiple antenna wireless AP to complete the task immediately. Accordingly, a four-phase communication protocol is proposed to ensure system performance. The system follows the cluster head (CH) scheme based on the channel state information (CSI) to harvest RF energy from the AP. To ensure the highest system performance, we propose two algorithms for determining the optimal EH time for two CHs: SCPM-GSS and SCPM-GA. In addition, we derive the closed-form expressions for the SCP of the system and each CH. Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the results of the analysis. The numerical results demonstrate the effects of crucial system parameters of our proposed NOMA scheme with those of conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes. Furthermore, the proposed optimization algorithms allow the system to avoid outages like the random parameters setting approach and improve the SCP by 3 to 30% compared to the fixed parameters set when the transmit power is low and medium.}

abstract = {In the era of industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) may potentially be used to provide reasoning and decision support on engineering and technical challenges. The role of AI in industrial design, which is the practice of improving the function, value and aesthetics of products to optimise customer satisfaction, has not yet been extensively explored. To effectively synthesise the existing literature, an unsupervised learning-enabled review methodology is proposed in this study. Important journals and articles are identified by using k-means clustering, and the relevant articles are analysed by using co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence analyses. Six clusters of the body of knowledge are then extracted, and naming of the clusters is assisted by using document summarisation and evaluation. Consequently, six intellectual cores related to AI in industrial design are formulated: (i) supply chain perspectives on product design and innovation, (ii) manufacturability and performance of new product development, (iii) intelligent tools and systems for industrial design and engineering, (iv) applied intelligence for product and service innovation, (v) industry 4.0 technologies for design and manufacturing, and (vi) blockchain-enabled artificial intelligence in industry 4.0. Future research trends on sustainable design, trust in AI, and emerging technology integration towards the next-generation AI in industrial design are discussed.}

The extensive use of physical and information digitalization called by ambitious revolution to redesign process plants significantly transforms the process safety landscape in the process industries. Digitalization depends on the reliable use of data. This becomes a new focus of process safety in digitalized process systems. Digitalization brings the opportunity to generate and collect digital operational data and reduce human operation for effective process monitoring and control for safety assurance. The system's capability of processing massive data becomes essential for process safety. Meanwhile, digitalization increases the complexity of human-computer interaction and consequently leads to new research and practical problems. With standalone processes connected to the Internet of Things, process plants become more attractive to terrorists. This inevitably invites cybersecurity concerns to process safety solutions. This chapter provides a brief overview of these benefits and issues.}

From implanted medical devices to motion-activated surveillance cameras and from driverless smart cars to voice-operated home management systems, IoT devices continue to permeate further and deeper into our lives. However, this widespread adoption of IoT devices has also given rise to a wide range of security, privacy and trust issues that are unique to the IoT ecosystem. Conventional solutions are ill-suited for the IoT domain due to limited resources, network dynamics, and evolving trust boundaries. Hence, novel mechanisms are needed to address the specific challenges of the IoT landscape. To this end, we propose a user-centric cloud-based service that allows device owners to have fine-grained control over what kind and how much data is shared through their IoT devices. Our scheme builds on top of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to instantiate secure virtual clones (shadows) of actual devices in the cloud, substantially reducing the attack surface for IoT networks. Furthermore, a scalable infrastructure in the cloud allows us to deploy sophisticated policy enforcement and data scrubbing mechanisms on a per application basis giving users explicit control over data sharing. The presented approach requires little effort on part of device vendors and users as the service provider handles the bulk of the work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically by implementing the service on SGX hardware and deploying advanced data cleansing policies on device-generated data.}

At present, these controls are prescriptive and pre-determined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic, possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics, data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted building management. This paper presents an integration technique for mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the end-user to select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through the spatio-temporal building performance data.}

While the research community has provided significant effort in either BC or I4.0 research domains, the complex implications of the adoption of BC technologies in this specific context are not analyzed in depth. This is a serious drawback because of the multiple and heterogeneous interactions between participants in the production network. In fact, researchers and practitioners involved in planning and deployment of I4.0 solutions may still face questions related to the needs solved by BC, the I4.0-related adoption scenarios explored, and the Key Performance Indicators to assess the effectiveness of these technologies. In this paper, we survey the existing literature to identify shared definitions and drivers that lead to the adoption of BC technologies in I4.0. Then, we analyze several practical use cases—under the umbrella (smart) contexts of Factory, Healthcare, and Energy—highlighting the need for comprehensive analysis including not only functional and architectural characteristics but also performance. We collect a number of Key Performance Indicators and organize the dozen aliases and variants, explaining their relationships and pointing at the relevant studies. Finally, we discuss limitations, challenges and future directions related to BC application to I4.0, and the role of performance analysis in this research.}

This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the nature and complexity of the evolution of water utilities, including the existing methodologies to model the changes and the knowledge gaps that must be addressed. This research found that technological, social, environmental, economic, regulatory and operational factors influence water utilities. New challenges are emerging around using legacy IT systems, aging infrastructure, environmental impact and sustainability, data management, data analytics and cybersecurity knowledge and skills, customer and community engagement, government reporting requirements and regulatory compliance. Water utilities are continuing to respond to influencing factors and address emerging challenges, and as a result, system interconnections are increasing, resulting in complexity and uncertainty. Methodological gaps exist in representing water utilities from a broader lens as a CPHS to identify and evaluate multiple influencing factors, their interconnections and impacts and evolving risks for supporting decision-making. Gaps also exist in strategic planning for technology adoption and data management. Future research requires a focus on identifying and mapping increasing system interconnections, modelling their emergent behaviour and understanding the implications of water utilities evolving as CPHSs.}

The systematic review of the available scientific literature revealed limited but rapidly growing coverage of the phenomenon by scientific studies, which have mainly focused on the role of a few digital technologies (above all, the Internet of Things), studied in isolation. The research has mainly adopted an empirical, case-based methodological approach, mostly investigating the industrial equipment, automotive, and IT industries and focusing on the role of digital technologies for the implementation of intermediate and advanced services.

The extant literature lacks the investigation on drivers, enablers, critical barriers, and challenges in adopting disruptive digital technologies along with CE practices in SC. To fill this lacuna, an in-depth state-of-the-art of review of 187 articles has been conducted which resulted in the identification of 49 drivers and enablers, and 25 barriers and challenges. Furthermore, a framework has been proposed to elucidate the connection between disruptive digital technologies and CE performance in SC. Our review reveals that digital technology enabled CE practices helps to improve several performance metrics like resource optimization, waste reduction, product life cycle, occupational health, social performance, product safety and quality, and customer loyalty and satisfaction.

This paper presents a framework of employee skills and competencies useful for developing occupational profiles for employees of companies transitioning towards Industry 4.0. The paper consists of a discussion of the theoretical and practical parts of case studies. The theoretical portion was created on the basis of a review of scientific literature and research studies regarding the competencies and skills of employees in the ongoing fourth industrial revolution. This part focuses on the skills profile of an Industry 4.0 employee and an Operator 4.0 (O4.0) from a creativity and innovativeness point of view. The link between the theoretical part and the case study analysis was a general framework for building the competencies and skills of the steelworker in the emerging fourth industrial revolution. The case study analysis covered the framework of competencies and skills of a metallurgist in smart manufacturing built into the organization of steel mills. Recruitment offers of a steel company implementing smart manufacturing (SM) projects and educational programmes of technical universities in the field of metallurgy were analysed. The aim of the study was to develop a framework for the profile of an employee working in an innovative company transforming to I4.0. The publication posed the following research questions (purposes/hypotheses): P1. To what extent do Polish companies in the metallurgical sector pay attention to creativity and innovation issues when looking for employees? P2. To what extent do the profile (portfolio) of metallurgy graduates of Polish technical universities turn their attention to the issues related to creativity and innovation?}

The integrated nature of modern economic systems requires advanced solutions based on combination of state-of-the-art digital techniques with revised classical managerial, economical and mathematical approaches. The research gap is emphasized with the less of literature sources devoted to practical aspects of such combined tools applications. On this issue the authors suggest the algorithmic framework with analytical model on information control enhancement to transport-related operations within complex transportation systems. The article proposes a model of total transportation time (TTT) estimation considering various restrictions, elasticity coefficient of customer satisfaction, sustainable development and social aspects. As a result of better information control, transportation system becomes more flexible for alternative solutions. It explains the high applied value of the conducted research aimed also on planning improvement through the precise control procedures in transportation systems. Holistic view on the problem of TTT definition through the prism of information integration brings the discussion forward on how many factors should be considered in planning and controlling of integrated transportation systems. The given numerical example for multimodal international conveyance highlights the role of the proposed algorithmic foundations towards information management and control in multi-object systems. Probabilistic estimation of process reliability corresponds to the need of planning agile transportation systems. The purpose of the study is to contribute to the research field of stochastic on-time arrival (SOTA) problem with consideration of many factors influencing on performance in integrated transportation systems. The algorithmic framework proposes a conceptual basis for management, planning and information control. Application of the proposed methodology helps obtaining higher probability of on time arrival and increase reliability of transportation systems.}

The adoption of Smart Manufacturing Systems in manufacturing companies is often seen as a strategy towards achieving improvements in productivity. However, there is little evidence to indicate that UK manufacturing SMEs are prepared for the implementation of such systems. Through the employment of a triangulation research approach involving the detailed examination of 36 UK manufacturing SMEs from three manufacturing sectors, this study investigates the level of awareness and understanding within SMEs of Smart Manufacturing Systems. The development of a profiling tool is shown and is subsequently used to audit company awareness and understanding of the key technologies, collaborative networks and systems of SMS. Further information obtained from semi-structured interviews and observations of manufacturing operations provide further contextual information. The findings indicate that whilst the priority technologies and systems differ between manufacturing sectors, the key issues around the need for developing appropriate collaborative networks and knowledge management systems are common to all sectors.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is a trend related to smart factories, which are cyber-physical spaces populated and controlled by the collective intelligence for the autonomous and highly flexible manufacturing purposes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.}

Preventing eavesdroppers from overhearing and stealing useful information in such high traffic environments is as challenging as eliminating them from the network. The goal of this survey is to present a comprehensive study of the latest PLS works proposed to enhance the security performance in different 5G technologies. The survey starts by first giving a detailed introduction and overview of existing surveys that explicitly or partially discuss PLS in 5G and its emerging technologies. Many researchers have presented a number of PLS schemes, using either a separate technology such as Multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO), Millimeter Wave (mmWave), Radio frequency (RF), Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), Visible light communication (VLC), etc., or a combination of two or more technologies, for securing each field of future 5G networks such as Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), Device-to-Device (D2D), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cognitive radio network (CRN), Unmanned Aerial Network (UAV), etc. After summarizing the existing surveys, we present a detailed overview on the PLS research works performed till now in HetNets, with respect to its different underlaying technologies, as well as in other emerging 5G technologies. Then, optimization ontology is presented that discusses different security metrics used for measuring PLS performance. Different from rest of the surveys, our survey includes a comprehensive discussion regarding the proposed PLS techniques based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, especially highlighting the works performed using reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms, allowing us to understand how artificial intelligence can help to achieve better PLS. Towards the end, we discuss numerous challenges being encountered in practical implementation of PLS techniques, and propose different interesting areas that can be opted as future research direction.}

The project started by considering both countries' national strategies for Industry 4.0 (MAKE-in India and Made Smarter, UK) to identify those areas marked as strategically critical and mapping them onto existing engineering curriculums across undergraduate engineering degrees. Based on local industry partners with clearly defined ‘digitalization’ opportunities, four industrial case studies were selected and reproduced inside both University labs in the form of student projects that were made available to all final year mechanical engineering students at both institutions. The resulting pilot projects exhibited the potential to expose undergraduate students to engineering concepts and techniques not currently covered in the taught curriculums, while offering industry a ‘soft landing’ on the use of Industry 4.0 tools which have not yet been embraced, mainly due to the lack of qualified personnel or access to specific technology skillsets, such as 3D printing, Augmented Reality and Digital Twins.}

abstract = {The provision of water and sanitation services is a key challenge worldwide. The size, complexity, and critical nature of the water and wastewater infrastructure providing such services make the planning and management of these systems extremely difficult. Following the digital revolution in many areas of our lives, the water sector has begun to benefit from digital transformation. Effective utilization of remotely sensed weather and soil moisture data for more efficient irrigation (i.e., for food production), better detection of anomalies and faults in pipe networks using artificial intelligence, the use of nature-inspired optimization to improve the management and planning of systems, and greater use of digital twins and robotics all exhibit great potential to change and improve the ways in which complex water systems are managed. However, there are additional risks associated with these developments, including—but not limited to—cybersecurity, incorrect use, and overconfidence in the capability and accuracy of digital solutions and automation. This paper identifies key advances in digital technology that have found application in the water sector, and applies forensic engineering principles to failures that have been experienced in industries further ahead with automation and digital transformation. By identifying what went wrong with new digital technologies that might have contributed to high-profile accidents in the car and aircraft industries (e.g., Tesla self-driving cars and the Boeing 737 MAX), it is possible to identify similar risks in the water sector, learn from them, and prevent future failures. The key findings show that: ① Automation will require “humans in the loop”; ② human operators must be fully aware of the technology and trained to use it; ③ fallback manual intervention should be available in case of technology malfunctioning; ④ while redundant sensors may be costly, they reduce the risks due to erroneous sensor readings; ⑤ cybersecurity risks must be considered; and ⑥ ethics issues have to be considered, given the increasing automation and interconnectedness of water systems. These findings also point to major research areas related to digital transformation in the water sector.}

Autonomic computing fundamentals have been substantially influenced by those of control theory for closed and open-loop systems. In practice, complex systems may exhibit a number of concurrent and inter-dependent control loops. Despite research into autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g., multiple resources within a data centre), research into integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve resource autonomy and performance at scale continues to be a fundamental challenge. The integration of AI/ML to achieve such autonomic and self-management of systems can be achieved at different levels of granularity, from full to human-in-the-loop automation. In this article, leading academics, researchers, practitioners, engineers, and scientists in the fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, and quantum computing join to discuss current research and potential future directions for these fields. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging AI and ML in next generation computing for emerging computing paradigms, including cloud, fog, edge, serverless and quantum computing environments.}

However, traditional financial audit approaches are less effective in providing ESG assurance due to the difference in the nature of evidence, difficulty in measuring and verifying ESG measures, and ever-changing ESG performance. To increase the effectiveness of ESG audit approaches, this study proposes Audit 4.0-based ESG assurance, which uses Big Data and emerging technologies of Audit 4.0 to capture evidence from the physical world and provide accurate assurance on ESG reports in a timely manner. We further perform a case study as a proof of concept of the proposed approach, which explores the integration of satellite-based methane estimation as ESG audit evidence.

We also present design recommendations for developing next-generation MES/MOM as a strong core to make factories smart and responsive. First, we analyze the architectural design challenges of MES/MOM in IIoT through a selective literature review. We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM. The results from our QFD analysis indicate that interoperability is the most important characteristic when designing a responsive smart factory, with the highest relative importance of 31% of the eight characteristics we studied.}

The results showed that research is recent and of increasing interest among researchers, mostly from Europe. Despite very limited number of empirical studies, the main sectors that apply I4.0 technologies with impacts on OHS were identified. From the analyzed literature, applications of technologies with potential for positive impacts on OHS were identified, (e.g., safer work environment, healthier workers and mitigation of occupational risks), as well as negative effects on OHS (there is evidence of increased stress, fatigue, diseases, musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial risks). The study also shows gaps and opportunities for future research. These results can help managers in planning, designing and managing the application and integration of technologies related to I4.0 in work environments.}

The resulting industrial environments require the development of information systems able to take the specifications of customers and convey them to the production system in such a way as to contribute to the coordination of all the stakeholders and activities required to fulfill the orders of the customers. This is beyond the capabilities of traditional systems based on MRP and ERP, since the information should be managed in a flexible and decentralized way to exploit the Smart Manufacturing facilities of Industry 4.0. Blockchain, instead, is a technology that provides those features constituting a sound information supporting basis for mass customized/personalized production. Consequently, we explore the potential of blockchain as an information technology able to support industries that base their business models on mass customized/personalized production processes. This survey allows us to identify important challenges for further developments, highlighting three issues in the production setting: (i) to deepen the interoperability of systems, (ii) to generate more implementations, and (iii) to develop efficient consensus protocols. As a response to these insights we provide a conceptual design of how blockchain contributes to managing efficiently mass customized production systems. In our design the information of customer specifications can be fused with data from the production process to generate a plan to fulfill the demand. This design arises as a solution approach to three stated problem, which are faced by mass customized production systems.}

abstract = {The ability to move production between different geographical locations has recently become more important, due to the increasing need for sustainability and faster response times, complying with local regulations, and dealing with brittle international supply chains. To this end, the movable factory concept has been put forward, which is defined as mobile production units that can be installed near the customer’s location. Unfortunately, industrial paradigms such as Industry 4.0 make little if any notice of movable factories but instead focus on the digitalization of their fixed counterparts. In the form of a systematic literature review, this paper breaks down the concept of the movable factory, relates it to the state-of-the-art, and summarizes its main use cases, requirements, research gaps, and opportunities. The review covers over 100 relevant articles published in the past two decades. Compared to existing surveys, we have not only focused on the motivations for movable factories, but also identified research gaps and discuss the impact of modern technologies such as Internet-of-Things, digital twins, and modeling and simulation in fulfilling these gaps. The result is a survey of the state-of-the-art and a list of domains for potential future research on different aspects of movable factories.}

In this paper, data-driven FDD is defined as those that are built or trained from data via machine learning or multivariate statistical analysis methods. Following this definition, this paper reviews and summarizes the literature on data-driven FDD from three aspects: process, systems studied (including the systems being investigated, the faults being identified, and the associated data sources), and evaluation metrics. A data-driven FDD process is further divided into the following steps: data collection, data cleansing, data preprocessing, baseline establishment, fault detection, fault diagnostics, and potential fault prognostics. Literature reported data-driven methods used in each step of an FDD process are firstly discussed. Applications of data-driven FDD in various HVAC systems/components and commonly used data source for FDD development are reviewed secondly, followed by a summary of typical metrics for evaluating FDD methods. Finally, this literature review concludes that despite the promising performance reported in the literature, data-driven FDD methods still face many challenges, such as real-building deployment, performance evaluation and benchmarking, scalability and transferability, interpretability, cyber security and data privacy, user experience, etc. Addressing these challenges is critical for a broad real-building adoption of data-driven FDD.}

However, technological advancements have led to industry 5.0 (i5.0), which present multiple favorable opportunities for manufacturing organizations in Africa. Technology adoption was identified as a key accelerator towards sustainable manufacturing and successful implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper aims to conscientise on the future of the manufacturing industry for an African digital economy. Adoption of new manufacturing technologies is disrupting traditional business models and creating new business models which are collaborative, and technology centered. A system of systems methodology was used to address multiple challenges affecting advancing technologies in the transport manufacturing industry in Africa. The result is a strategic system mapping for developing a cognitive manufacturing system for the transport manufacturing system.}

This study aims to identify the current energy management trends and their impact on ports and analyse the resulting scenarios. A literature review on energy management trends and ports' value chains was used to develop a conceptual framework, from which a Delphi questionnaire was created. The questionnaire was administered in two rounds, during which experts assessed the probability, impacts and desirability of energy sources, renewable energy, cold ironing, equipment, alternative fuels, energy digitalisation, human resources, emergencies and security. The results are clustered to depict the following port's energy management scenarios: most critical (related to digitalisation, cybersecurity, installation of renewable energy in small ports and electrification of docks and vehicles), most uncertain (concerning inland and/or offshore expansion of renewable energy production, use of autonomous vehicles and energy self-sufficiency of large ports) and most desired (involving investments on cold-ironing, alternatively powered cranes and cost reduction for photovoltaics and wind power). The research implications include conceptual actions to be considered and introduced in a generic European port plan and provide strategy recommendations to foster future ports.}

The potential applications of 6G wireless networks for faster data processing in RES include P2P energy trade market, vehicular network, wireless energy transfer, energy management system, smart grid, self-healing, smart batteries and AI-based weather forecasting. This paper also lists the advantages and challenges of 6G in RES sectors, the practical implementations and the potential applications. It was found out that although the 6G is a visionary application in the RES sector to improve the security, connectivity, integration and sensory data processing of RES, 6G still possesses various technical limitations, including incompatibility issues of older devices, higher power consumption and higher operating cost. Future research should focus on the improvements of 6G in RES in terms of cost-effectiveness, compatibility issues and power consumption to balance between the advancement and limitations. This review serves as a visionary for 6G wireless communication to be applied in the RES sector in the near future. 6G in the RES sector encountered several critical limitations needing an intensive development, including still the issues of security and privacy, prone to hacking or data bleaching, required advanced hardware support and requirements for ultra-fast communications with low latency.}

The pharmaceutical supply chain processes are considered as the mediators and the emerging technology adoption barriers are proposed as the moderators. The study is evaluated using a survey of pharmaceutical companies in India. The findings indicate that manufacturing, distribution and consumption processes in the supply chain mediate the effects of emerging technologies on supply chain performance; however, mediating effects are weakened due to the presence of intricate barriers.

Smart buildings (SB) use resources efficiently, save energy, and provide services to the community more easily for their occupants while reducing their environmental footprint. Smart cities have benefited from this growth in terms of smart buildings. Maximum accuracy and reduced latency are both required for smart building monitoring systems. Poor scheduling rules can lead to network congestion and latency that is too high for real-time monitoring on construction sites, which have restricted computing and networking capabilities. These devices can collect the data on on-site actions, achievements, and circumstances and send it back to the central dashboard for analysis. Model predictive control and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have significant drawbacks, and DRL addresses some drawbacks. Researchers are intrigued by DRL, a brand-new approach to quality control. The most important considerations for developing smart power grid systems are energy conservation, renewable energy integration, and a streamlined control system. Experiments have shown that the new video surveillance has a low loss rate and a consistent latency. The DRL-SB-IoT technique can successfully track multiple cameras in a wide monitoring situation. This technique results in excellent tracking performance and meets the criteria for developing an intelligent campus in the best way possible. Researchers analyzed studies using supervised learning to solve common building issues, such as health monitoring, security on building sites, accommodation modeling, and energy consumption prediction. Reinforcement learning has been used to solve these issues. The proposed method advances the smart gateway channel of 97.5%, the energy storage ratio of 96.9%, and the overall surveillance performance ratio of 98.6%.}

The European Commission (EC) has launched the European Green Deal communication, setting out the path for a fundamental transformation of Europe. Key element in this policy is a fully sustainable food system outlined in the farm-to-fork strategy. Such strategy requires a systems approach in which all aspects related to the production and consumption of sufficient and healthy food are considered, including economic, environmental (climate, ecosystems) and social aspects.
Scope and approach
Here, we present the systems approach concept for food production, following the farm-to-fork principle as embraced by the EC, and elaborate on how digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can solve the challenges that a sustainable food system imposes.
Key findings and conclusions
We present a number of research and innovation challenges and illustrate these by some specific examples. It is concluded that AI and digitalisation show great potential to support the transition towards a sustainable food system. This development will impact the roles and interactions of the actors in the entire value chain from farmers to consumers. Policy recommendations are made for a successful future implementation of AI in sustainable food production.}

abstract = {Despite the significant fluctuations in global trend due to the rising trade friction and the COVID19 pandemic, the container terminals are continuously working in three technology areas including automation, electrification and digitalization. This study reviewed recent technology trends as well as relevant research topics related to the container terminals, and investigated how the trends and topics would facilitate the terminals to achieve their strategic objectives. We also studied the trends in the container terminal industry before and after the pandemic outbreak. Recent progress shows that generally the long-term plans remain unchanged while there are some changes in timeline and priorities. The findings suggest that despite the common interest in long-term plans, gaps are still identified between academia and industry interests. Future directions are discussed for these technology areas, particularly in the context of the post-pandemic world, where the limited resources should be invested to the most urgent areas.}

Network managers can easily manage and regulate the entire network using its programmable central controller architecture. This central controller serves as the focal point for numerous attack vectors due to its centralized structure. However, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against the SDN is the most prominent. The goal of this project is to use a machine learning method to categorize SDN traffic as either attack or normal traffic. Next, the Feature Selection method, such as the Filter-based Fisher score method, Wrapper-based method, and analysis of variables (ANOVA) f-test, is used for finely-granulated detection. Then, a rule-based detection method using the Renyi joint entropy algorithm is employed to detect DDoS attacks on SDN controllers. We manage a public "DDoS attack SDN Dataset" with 23 attributes overall. The dataset includes normal and attack traffic for the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Except for attributes that specify the target and source machines, the dataset, which contains more than 100,000 recordings, has statistical features such as byte count, duration sec, packet rate, and packet per flow. In the classification process, many classifiers such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) were used. The test results demonstrated the efficacy and efficiency of the suggested strategy using the analysis of variables (ANOVA), which performed better than competing methods across a range of evaluation parameters.}

However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.}

Further, it delineates the usage of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), and internet of things (IoT) to bring on solutions/approaches to evolving to pandemic-constrained manufacturing. An overall of twelve key factors is determined from extensive literature reviews which are categorized into challenges and solutions. Here, ISM methodology has been used to establish the interrelationship among identified twelve challenges and solutions. Further, MICMAC analysis has categorized them according to their driving and dependence power. The consequences display the absence of autonomous factors whilst efficient supply chain, centralized decision making, product diversification, and JIT along with revenue generation turn out to be significant dependant factors. The facilitators like digital technologies are the pre-cursors to the ultimate solution of revenue generation and termed preliminary solutions. The outcomes of this research will suggest eventual policy recommendations for industry leaders to progress manufacturing within Covid-19 constraints. It will offer a sturdy base for manufacturers around the world to tune to the new digital transformation of the production scenario.}

abstract = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

First, device security is designed via the policy engine and policy administrator module using the SCSPN model. SCSPN is performed into IIoT to improve the secure data communication between devices. Next, the device block is sent to receiver for performing decryption and obtaining original device information by such policy and studying communication patterns between devices. Next, data security is presented via a policy enforcement module using Transfer Fuzzy Learning. The results show that the proposed method achieves better data confidentially rate as 8 %, minimal network access time as 28 %, a better data integrity rate as 9 % and a reduced false positive rate as 25 %, as compared to existing techniques.}

The increasing number of mobile devices and the diverse resource requirements of the growing IoV have resulted in a shift from centralized resource management to a decentralized approach. This shift offers improved fault tolerance, scalability, and privacy preservation. However, constructing collaborative awareness and coordination mechanisms between multiple vehicles and edge nodes in a decentralized manner is a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized many-to-many task offloading method that aims to minimize the average task completion latency of vehicles. In this study, we propose a data-sharing mechanism between vehicles and edge servers using the digital twin service, which provides global environmental perceptions to the vehicles by a low-cost approach. Additionally, we develop a mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to generate coordinated task offloading schemes. Instead of interacting with multiple agents, the vehicle only needs to respond to the mean action of the environment. Based on this transition, the agent generates coordinated task offloading decisions in complex scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our method using real urban traffic data. Experiment results verify the efficiency of our proposed method.}

abstract = {Concerns regarding digital transformation have forced manufacturing organizations to rethink their operations and processes to gain a competitive advantage. For several companies, the design and implementation of indicators are deemed crucial for better management and control of emerging concepts and ideas regarding digital technologies. Despite the quick shift towards digital transformation has captured the attention of both the industry and academia, very few efforts have been made to streamline useful indicators able to monitor the implementation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. Owing to these considerations, this paper attempts (i) to design and implement several Key Performance Indicators able to monitor the evolution of core processes that will benefit from the I4.0 technologies, and (ii) to provide an easy-to-use approach that can be implemented in practice to guide decision-makers in the diffusion, adoption, and performance evaluation of I4.0 technologies. The effectiveness and practicality of the methodology are illustrated using a case study concerning an industrial project implemented in a leading international company in the power generation industry.}

abstract = {Transport Mode Detection (TMD) has become a crucial part of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) thanks to the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, which enable the collection and processing of a vast amount of information on how people move and behave over space and time. Since smartphones and smartwatches have enabled people to stay connected to the internet all the time, predicting a person’s mode of transportation has become easier since live location data can be collected easily. Vehicular Edge Networks (VEN) connect all smart vehicular edge devices and global cloud servers collect those devices’ sensory data to try to predict a person’s commute route using Machine Learning models. However, since the data is shared globally, security can be compromised, causing a large section of the population to be unwilling to share their sensory data with global cloud servers. The current state-of-the-art methods have achieved high accuracy in identifying a person’s transportation mode. Nevertheless, most of the approaches do not address the privacy issues of the user data as the methods use centralized training systems. There are also decentralized federated learning systems that address the privacy issues of user data by often sacrificing the performance of the models by training them on a vast amount of decentralized data. In this research, we propose a hybrid Federated Ensemble-Learning (FedEL) model to detect transportation modes in VEN, which improves federated strategies in terms of performance as well. XGBoost, Random Forest, and MLP are trained with data from each local client through an ensemble method. A prediction is then delivered based on a majority vote among the three models, and the most-voted class is considered. Based on extensive testing, the FedEL technique delivers a 95.10% accuracy rate for a first dataset (5-second window) and a 98.61% accuracy rate for another dataset (half-second window) on a TMD dataset available in the literature.}

abstract = {Considering the nascent application of advanced technologies in industry within the context of the new industrial revolution, we propose a methodology for identification and design (ID) of smart operations in manufacturing. The ID study considers the elements of the Industry 4.0 (I4) such as autonomous robots, advanced analytics, systems integration, high-end sensing, big data, internet of things, cloud computing and human-machine interactions. Toward achievable I4-based production, the proposed IDoI4 (ID-of-I4) approach integrates I4 fundamental elements regarding a) modelling and solution algorithms (MSA), b) information and communication technologies (ICT), c) high-performance computing (HPC), and d) mechatronics (MEC). These four groups of the I4 elements are examined in the industrial cases covering from mature industries to laboratory level systems to determine their current technological states and gaps into the I4 stage. The examples highlighted are crushed-ore stockpile level control in the mining field, resin bed cleaning timetabling in water demineralisation treatment, compositional data-driven real-time optimisation of hydrocarbon streams and diverse I4 basics in the next generation of biorefineries. In the main example, supported by a high-end sensing apparatus to measure crushed-ore stockpile levels in real-time (live inventory as a controlled variable by a target), a hybrid dynamic control prescribes (every 4 minutes) discrete positions and time-slots of the shuttle-conveyor tripper car mechatronics that creates the stockpiles. From such IDoI4 methodology, a table on the MSA, ICT, HPC and MEC ground bases summarises how such technologies are integrated to the industrial examples considering research, development and deployment in stable, demanded and highly demanded stages of the technologies into the I4 mandate.}

Different digital technologies (DTs) can be integrated into manufacturing processes and systems aiming at increasing flexibility, product quality or productivity. The type and scope of potential DTs must be carefully selected when planning and improving a manufacturing system. The definition and configuration could be supported by simulation techniques that assess the DTs' impact on the manufacturing system and its final performance. However, parametrizing the DTs into a simulation tool is not straightforward since appropriate models might be challenging to obtain and actual impacts of DTs are uncertain. Against this background, the paper presents methods to enable a simulation-based assessment while considering the impact of not just individual but also a combination of DTs. The paper introduces a framework to define the base characteristics of selected DTs within a manufacturing system and their parameterization into a commercial simulation tool. Furthermore, the usability and expectable results are demonstrated in a case study.}

Based on the sample of analyzed works, the results indicate that industry 4.0 has embraced the use of these technologies. Heterogeneous solution proposals in various fields of application and activities were found. Notwithstanding, the research articles report similar advantages and benefits (e.g., high performance on human tasks or robot collaboration, high-quality rates for specific products, among others). In addition, we present the most widespread equipment and devices that are currently preferred to develop extended reality applications, which allows us to identify hardware patterns commonly shared in a variety of fields. Whilst, with the aid of association rules, we reveal further insights among the items of the proposed taxonomy. Furthermore, we also present a thorough analysis of trends and research directions in the extended reality field for industry 4.0.

It is anticipated that the 6G generation would have even more severe performance criteria than the 5G generation had. New sophisticated technologies and paradigms must be included into 6G network designs and procedures to satisfy the requirements and standards of the sixth generation. As a result, several publications and studies covering the relevant technologies, techniques, algorithms, and architectures have appeared in the recent few years. The current paper fills a gap in the literature by offering informative recommendations for further study of 6G networks. Connectivity targets within 6G are outlined, and the study explains the wireless progression toward 6G networks. The technologies are outlined, as are the obstacles that must be surmounted. This chapter also provides a thorough and up-to-date overview of the state of the art. Additionally, multiple classifications of 6G capabilities and techniques are provided, with an emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of each process.

Implementing big data and the internet of things improves the monitoring and integration of different infrastructure systems in SC and thus makes our cities more efficient, livable, and sustainable. However, big data is more vulnerable to attacks and hacking, posing significant challenges to the SC's privacy and security. Moreover, more regulations and rules about protecting user data are being enforced worldwide. Compared with centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) provides a natural method to protect users' privacy by distributing learning over decentralized data and offers artificial intelligence advantages for sensitive, heterogeneous data domains. Researchers have recently implemented FL, motivated by the improvement in privacy and security of integrated systems in SC. However, many technological problems and risks have been identified. This study provides a comprehensive review of FL's application to improve privacy and security in SC systems (i.e., transportation, healthcare, communication, etc.). The benefits, drawbacks, open research issues and future directions of the implementation of FL in SC are thoroughly discussed. The study concluded that the existing FL systems required comprehensive testing for different types of attacks, further improving the data protection and performance in SC.}

Methodologies for PHM are either model-driven, data-driven or a fusion of both approaches. Data-driven approaches make extensive use of large-scale datasets collected from physical assets to identify underlying failure mechanisms and root causes. In recent years, many data-driven PHM models have been developed to evaluate system’s health conditions using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to condition monitoring data. The field of AI is fast gaining acceptance in various areas of applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and smart devices. With advancements in the use of AI technologies in Industry 4.0, where systems consist of multiple interconnected components in a cyber–physical space, there is increasing pressure on industries to move towards more predictive and proactive maintenance practices. In this paper, a thorough state-of-the-art review of the AI techniques adopted for PHM of engineering systems is conducted. Furthermore, given that the future of inspection and maintenance will be predominantly AI-driven, the paper discusses the soft issues relating to manpower, cyber-security, standards and regulations under such a regime. The review concludes that the current systems and methodologies for maintenance will inevitably become incompatible with future designs and systems; as such, continued research into AI-driven prognostics systems is expedient as it offers the best promise of bridging the potential gap.}

A qualitative analysis using in-depth interviews and multiple case studies identifies prominent barriers and incentives, whilst a quantitative analysis on a representative sample of 500 local manufacturing units in Piedmont (a region of Northern Italy) is undertaken via an OLS regression-based path analysis. The results of the parallel-serial multiple mediation model show that: (1) greater openness to Industry 4.0 is related to better performance; (2) greater openness to Industry 4.0 leads to a higher perception of barriers; (3) greater knowledge-related and economic and financial barriers improve performance, abstracting from the adoption of incentives; and (4) greater openness to Industry 4.0 drives the adoption of incentives. However, perceived economic and financial barriers are found not to drive firms to adopt more incentives. The study contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying previously unidentified strengths and weaknesses to barriers and incentives, and highlights the necessity of policies that reflect real firms’ needs.}
