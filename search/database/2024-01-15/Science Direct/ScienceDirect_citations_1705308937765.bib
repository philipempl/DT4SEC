abstract = {Safety education has found a place in the chemical engineering curriculum. However, its complete impact is yet to be realized. A part of this delay may be attributed to the gap between the concepts traditionally taught in engineering education and the tools required for the practice of engineering in the process industry. This gulf is only exacerbated by the advent of Industry 4.0, which relies heavily on emerging technologies, such as big data, automation, and machine learning. Therefore, a fundamental aspect that educators of process safety need to readdress is the following: “How can safety knowledge and competence among engineering graduates be enhanced for them to have a sustained impact on the safe design and operation of chemical processes during industrial practice?” In this context, the present work investigates the status of safety knowledge development and transfer from education to practice. A detailed analysis of demographic and temporal evaluation of safety education in specific engineering disciplines, and the shortcomings of the current curricula in imparting safety concepts to the students, are also discussed in detail. This perspective attempts to bridge the gap between academic training and the job requirements of process safety engineers through a concept titled ‘Safety Education 4.0’. In the proposed Safety Education 4.0 methodology, academics and industry personnel collaborate in teaching students safety principles through project-based learning (PBL). The compact modular format of PBL makes it flexible to be updatable on-demand process safety education.}

abstract = {Machine tool controllers (MTCs) are evolving rapidly in response to the growing precision requirements, industry-wide thrusts to integrate cloud applications, external sensors and other data sources, as well to assure cybersecurity. However, most of the MTCs have closed architecture. This severely impedes the innovations to enhance their performance as well as assure their safety and security. Digital emulators, as alternatives to real closed architecture MTCs, are considered essential to assess the performance of the closed MTCs and various innovations therein. We present a machine learning method to create digital emulators that can mimic the dynamics of closed architecture MTCs. The proposed method is based on interrogating the controller using a set of production recipes (e.g., G-codes) and employing the response of the controller to learn a low-dimensional parameterization of the underlying architecture. The low-dimensional base model captures the key aspects of the structure and dynamic connectivity among the various components of an MTC. The parameters of the base model are tuned based on the outputs of an MTC gathered using standard data exchange protocols (e.g. OPC UA, MTConnect). We applied the proposed approach to develop emulators for a SIEMENS controller that mimics X–Y motion of their 2-axis motion control systems. The current implementation of the emulator can track the measured path trajectories up to 0.23 mm accuracy for various geometries tested. Our approach can be used to generalize emulator development for different types of real world MTCs.}

abstract = {The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.}

abstract = {Deciding the correct offensive security strategy for safeguarding the electrical physical infrastructures of smart grids is a challenging task. The offensive security training against various cyber-attacks focuses on a multitude of electrical subsystems and measurement systems like the Load Frequency Control(LFC) system. Primarily, the principal challenge is to categorize and parameterize the various possible cyber-attacks on electrical infrastructures. This is done by specifying and selecting cyber-attacks considering various main and subsystem blocks of the power structural system within each area of major installations. In this research investigation, formal modeling of security strategy is proposed using Lambda calculus with both classical and quantum perspectives. Furthermore, using a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) technique, the procedure for correct vulnerability prediction, exploitation, and execution strategy is presented with an approximated likelihood of attack and its mode. The local and non-local interactions are introduced as quantum threats and entanglement threats similar to False Data Injection (FDI) methods to induce the attack and counter-attack events through quantum causality connections. Finally, the Quirk simulator is used to validate the proposed quantum design of offensive and defensive attack models considering scenarios of exogenous and scaling attacks on the LFC systems that support the feasibility of the present research work to address the issue of cyber-attacks on the power system networks.}

Each TC brings its own vision and puts forward trends and issues important and relevant for future research. The analysis is performed on the enterprise-level topics with an interface too other relevant systems (e.g., supply chains). The vision developed might lead to the identification of new scientific control directions such as Industry 4.0 technology-enabled new production strategies that require highly customised supply network control, the creation of resilient enterprise to cope with risks, developments in management decision-support systems for the design, and scheduling and control of resilient and digital manufacturing networks, and collaborative control. Cobots, augmented reality and adaptable workstations are a few examples of how production and logistic systems are changing supporting the operator 4.0. Sustainable manufacturing techniques, such closed-loop supply chains, is another trend in this area. Due to increasing number of elements and systems, complex and heterogeneous enterprise systems need to be considered (e.g., for decision-making). These systems are heterogeneous and build by different stakeholders. To make use of these, an environment is needed that allows the integration of the systems forming a System-of-Systems (SoS). The changing environment requires models which adapt over time. Some of the adaptation is due to learning, other mechanisms include self-organisation by intelligent agents. In general, models and systems need to be modular and support modification and (self-)adaptation. An infrastructure is needed that supports loose coupling and evolving systems of systems. The vision of the overall contribution from the research community in manufacturing and logistics systems, over the next few years is to bring together researchers and practitioners presenting and discussing topics in modern manufacturing modelling, management and control in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-based resilient and innovative production SoS and supply networks.}

The Singapore government has realized the enormous potential of smart FM in developing a sustainable city and has implemented several initiatives to promote its adoption. However, the adoption of smart FM in the built environment industry is still in its early stage. Therefore, this study aims to (1) investigate drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM; and (2) explore whether there are significant differences in the perceived importance of the drivers, barriers, and strategies by designations and years of experience. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted to identify 6 drivers, 13 barriers, and 10 strategies. A survey questionnaire was designed and then validated by pilot interviews to collect data from practitioners in the built environment industry. Post-survey interviews were also carried out to validate the analysis results from the questionnaire survey. The study identified that increased energy savings, improved sustainability, and reduced downtime are the three most important drivers. Poor data management, high initial cost, and high cybersecurity risks are the three most important barriers. Development of technology selection mechanisms, improvement of smart FM system, and increased amount of funding are the three most effective strategies to address the challenges. Designations and years of experience have been proved to affect the perceptions of the importance of drivers, barriers, and strategies. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM, offering a starting point for organizations to consider its adoption. This study also enriches the knowledge of smart FM in the built environment industry with the expectations of facilitating the digital transformation and sustainable development of the built environment industry.}

Same old processes despite switching over to Outcome Based Education or EESD or Industry 4.0 are being continued. Disruption is most sought after in engineering education as it offers lot of advantages like leadership, profit and professional standing. Many Institutions offering engineering programs try to implement disruptions but fail because of lack of understanding about disruption and the associated processes, required finances, Human Resources and more importantly the innovation capabilities. Disruption is a process where a product outsmarts others through Innovation either in Technology or in Product or in processes. Disruption is building a new eco-system to meet the customer’s purpose of buying a product, service or a program. Of late people are trying to implement innovations in Engineering Education with no knowledge of Disruption, its properties and processes. In this paper, we try to take an example of Kingsmen Coffee, a company trying to disrupt in the Indian market, analyse what it is offering and how they are trying to disrupt the existing players and what lessons does it offer to Engineering Educators in Disruption. Kingsmen Coffee is a coffee dispensing machine with new technology and the way it is creating win-win situations for all the stake holders involved, is a matter of interest and study for Engineering Educators.

abstract = {Blockchain applications in maritime logistics services face uncertainties and risks, obstructing a broader and more sustainable adoption. Although the operational risk of blockchain-integrated systems (BISs) is significant, studies in this area are still conceptual and scarce. This research is a mixed-methods risk analysis focusing on (1) modeling the risk situation by a connected network of potential disruptive events in container shipping BISs, and (2) applying a quantitative risk analysis with probabilistic indexes considering the multiplicity of multi-event risk scenarios (MESs). Thirty-two telephone interviews with experts from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders helped establish a risk network with the description of 25 vertices and 54 directed connections. The quantitative analysis of 64 web survey responses provided insights and foresight about different characteristics of each risk and causal connection. The results enable a comprehensive view of the potential failure modes of blockchain applications. This study is the first to explore the potential risk situation in container shipping BISs with inputs from the industry. The applied methodological framework expands the toolkit of risk researchers, analysts, and managers against the fast-paced development of digitalization in maritime logistics and supply chain operations.}

abstract = {Smart Manufacturing enterprises emerge as interconnected, geographically distributed, data driven, and adaptive. While smartness is improved by the integration of information, this also leads to complexity. In this paper, smart manufacturing enterprises are modeled as a complex adaptive system with resiliency as a property. Resiliency is indicated by the enterprises’ ability to comprehensively understand risks and adapt to changes, and information integration plays an important role. A systematic literature review reveals that the current perspectives on manufacturing resiliency are narrow as they are concentrated on isolated parts of the manufacturing process and do not account for enterprise-wide risks that are typical to a smart manufacturing enterprise. An expanded set of risk sources is important for resiliency and information integration has a key role to play in reducing these risks. The complex adaptive systems lens employed in the paper prescribes a five-part framework to organize key risk sources including: external environment, internal environment, manufacturing processes, technology; and demand-supply networks. Additionally, for each key risk source, the role of integrated information is discussed. Lastly, complexity of a single function (logistics) is described and the rational for a CAS view is provided.}

Nevertheless, there is a lack of common understanding of Industry 4.0 and tools to help companies’ transformation to Industry 4.0, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To address these research gaps, this study proposes a framework to characterise and evaluate Industry 4.0 scenarios to aid companies’ transition towards Industry 4.0. For this, a design science (multi-methodological) approach is adopted, including an Industry 4.0 use case survey, modelling and simulation and two proof-of-concept cases developed in collaboration with a Canadian college centre for technology transfer. The results indicate that the proposed framework can help companies identify Industry 4.0 scenarios more intuitively to assist project conception, portfolio selection and planning during Industry 4.0 roadmap development. Finally, the results of this study suggest that Industry 4.0 can be implemented incrementally while companies increase their digital capabilities and maturity.}

The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 has further increased the urgent need for digital transformation within the health care settings, with the use of artificial intelligence/deep learning, internet of things, telecommunication network/virtual platform, and blockchain. The recent advent of metaverse, an interconnected online universe, with the synergistic combination of augmented, virtual, and mixed reality described several years ago, presents a new era of immersive and real-time experiences to enhance human-to-human social interaction and connection. In health care and ophthalmology, the creation of virtual environment with three-dimensional (3D) space and avatar, could be particularly useful in patient-fronting platforms (eg, telemedicine platforms), operational uses (eg, meeting organization), digital education (eg, simulated medical and surgical education), diagnostics, and therapeutics. On the other hand, the implementation and adoption of these emerging virtual health care technologies will require multipronged approaches to ensure interoperability with real-world virtual clinical settings, user-friendliness of the technologies and clinical efficiencies while complying to the clinical, health economics, regulatory, and cybersecurity standards. To serve the urgent need, it is important for the eye community to continue to innovate, invent, adapt, and harness the unique abilities of virtual health care technology to provide better eye care worldwide.}

EV has possibly reduced the dependency on fossil fuel-based Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and an alternate mainstream transportation system in major countries. When comparing well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel fuel efficiency, the overall efficiency of the EV is 77%, while ICE has 13% only. This shows EVs are six times more efficient than ICE vehicles. However, the world couldn't adapt to the EV because of its limited travel range and other major issues related to charging infrastructure and high pricing. This paper explores the need for advancement in electric vehicle technology and details the downsides of the current EV technologies. This study mainly focuses on the Indian market, as in India EV sales growth has tripled in recent days, and some major factors that hurdle the growth of EVs. Further, the study discusses the recent research and innovative commercial projects related to charging infrastructure, battery energy storage, and energy management technologies that require advancement at an affordable price and convenience equal to the ICE vehicles. Finally, the study ends with outlooks of various electric vehicle technology and their advancement.

Some companies and experts believe that “Oil and Gas 4.0” can completely change the status quo of the oil and gas industry, which can bring huge benefits because it accelerates the digitization and intelligentization of the oil and gas industry. However, the “Oil and Gas 4.0” is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper systematically introduces the concept and core technologies of “Oil and Gas 4.0”, such as big data and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Moreover, this paper analyzes typical application scenarios of the oil and gas industry chain (upstream, midstream and downstream) through examples, such as intelligent oilfield, intelligent pipeline, and intelligent refinery. It is concluded that the essence of “Oil and Gas 4.0” is a data-driven intelligence system based on the highly digitization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic peer-reviewed paper on the “Oil and Gas 4.0” era, aiming to let more oil and gas industry personnel understand its benefits and application scenarios, so as to better apply it to practical engineering in the future. In the discussion section, this paper also analyzes the opportunities and difficulties that may be brought about by the “Oil and Gas 4.0” era. Finally, relevant policy recommendations are proposed.}

Based on semi-structured interviews with senior executives of liner shipping companies, this study explores the current digital maturity levels, the opportunities provided by digitalization and the underlying challenges that hinder its implementation in the liner shipping segment within the larger maritime logistics industry and identifies the essential leading strategies of digitalization in this segment. The digital maturity categories applied to liner shipping provide an opportunity for practitioners in this industry to evaluate their business functions’ digital maturity levels. Furthermore, based on interview data, digital transformation for the maritime logistics industry is defined, as well as 9 major barriers and 19 different pathways to digital transformation are identified. Understanding the key challenges and success factors in the industry is a key to approaching digitalization problems and developing a healthy digital transformation process.}

abstract = {Under the push of the European Green Deal [1], a transformation to “make things” is taking place. The Danieli Intelligent Plant DIP has the ambition to enable the Sustainability of metals manufacturing. DIP is a new fully immersive control and supervision model based on augmented, mixed and virtual reality sensing and processing technologies. Processes, machines and equipment are holistically integrated with operators/decision makers using data-driven approaches and AI and ML. This allows to extensively control, supervise processes and machines characterized by large degree of autonomy to optimize processes, quality and maintenance operations. Firstly, a new concept of HCI (Human Computer Machine Interface) has been realized based on the evolution of 3Q philosophy allowing local and remote monitoring and control of processes through the same approach customized for different technological scenarios. Remote cooperation, assistance and maintenance is also part of the environment for having no-man-on-floor increasing safety and putting the focus on control and human centrality. Not less important, the extensive use of mobile solutions (wireless Local Control Station) have an important role to reduce the human factor whenever a shop floor operation is mandatory.}

The assessment of control strategies and intelligent features using Deep Learning is essential to ensure high-performance CAV deployment in view of number of scenarios and technologies. CAV deployment is dependent on communications and cybersecurity layers where the effective operation of CAV is based on vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure, and vehicle-to-human interactions. In order to understand and assess CAV functions, an integrated test platform is presented, which is used to demonstrate their capabilities for effective deployment. Robot-assisted CAV systems can provide additional features for higher-performance CAV deployment with considerations of human factors with additional intelligent features using robot-assisted decisions. Detailed analysis of CAV deployment strategies is discussed to facilitate the smooth implementation in smart cities.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a review of the modern approaches of digitalization in the oil and gas industry. The objective is understanding the current applications of the traditional technologies used in the petroleum industry and studying the opportunities for implementing innovative digital tools and systems that could enhance the operational efficiency and reduce the cost, risk, and environmental impacts. The paper consists of several tasks starting from reviewing the present technologies used mainly in the upstream activities: exploration, field development, drilling and completion, and operation and production. The techniques used for gathering and analyzing the big data packages received from unlimited digitalized resources is the second task covered in this paper while the computing technologies such as cloud and cognitive computing as well as the advanced analytical and numerical solutions developed by real-time algorithms is the third task. Detail information about the short- and long-term digitalization technologies in both hardware and software parts is represented in this paper such as robotics and automation, powerful sensors and measuring tools, unmanned vehicles and drones, 3D printers and wearable gadgets as well as artificial inelegance, machine learning, and digital-twin computing. Real examples of currently used digitalized applications in different upstream sections of the petroleum industry are demonstrated while the expected added values created by the digitalization for the industry and communities and the possible changes either positively or negatively in the operational costs, maintenance patterns, workforce safety, environmental impacts, job positions, and the required skills and experiences during digitalization era are explained. The outcomes are summarized in the following points. The digitalization should be the priority for most upstream companies in order to enhance and optimize the production system. The big volume of data may require innovative computing tools that could develop powerful analytical models used for calibrating the production environment and maximizing the production capacity of oil and gas fields. Data transfer and data sharing are two key factors in the digital transformation where the integrated data platforms could enhance the collaboration among the participants of the oil and gas ecosystems and accelerate innovative solutions. The digital era may lead to a sharp decline in the workforce and significant changes in the job position description as the human intervention with the production system might be minimized. The expected added value of the digital transformation during the next decades will be very big wherein the upstream petroleum industry may have the biggest share that could be more than 60% of the total investments while the midstream industry may have only 10%. There will be also a lot of challenges represented by the fact that the petroleum industry has not yet made the necessary shift in mindset to embrace the digitalization potential. Moreover, the digitalization era may require new revolutionized regulations especially in terms of sharing the data and changing the structures of the organizations as well as the workforces.}

In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of fog computing. This review article aims to classify recently published studies and investigate the current status in the area of fog computing. In this work, we have discussed the important characteristics of fog computing frameworks and identified various issues related to its architectural design, QoS metrics, implementation details, applications and communication modes. We have proposed taxonomy for fog computing frameworks based on the existing literature and compared the different research work based on taxonomy. Finally, various open research challenges and promising future directions are highlighted for further research in the area of fog computing.}

abstract = {The cyber-physical integration in the sense of industry 4.0, applied to industrial process control, needs to develop new methodologies. Both top-down hierarchies of commands for Enterprise Resource Planning, Optimization, Advanced Control, Local Control, and bottom-up flux of information from the plant floor to control system, optimization level, and planning strategy are dissolved, aiming to enhance the vertical and horizontal integration and flexible operability. Even though this is a requirement for Cyber-Physical Systems, it would be merely a coexistence of advanced optimization IoT technologies states of art. Therefore, there is a need for a new architecture of a functional system. Since it works essentially as an event-based system, ontology plays a key concept in the practical working of the new process control. First, an overview of the general ontologies framework applied in Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, some ontologies published for chemical process design are discussed extensively here. Then the practical ontology and taxonomy needed for industrial process control are discussed. Here is presented how to recover the functional layers to each specific application of former traditional hierarchy top-down and bottom-up, now named as semantic layers. A description’s language development for process control using this ontology is another challenging task, also proposed. A case based on the transition of the traditional batch reactor process to modern industry 4.0 application illustrates the change of the operation mode. Finally, the potential gains and technology limitations are analyzed as a critique as the enabling technologies (or pillars) of Industry 4.0 to show what concepts apply to this enhanced process control. It also compares and analyzes this modern approach in the manufacturing process and the difference with the industrial process control. The construction of a complete system based on ontology and description language ready for application is an impressive task to be developed further. The main objective of the work, for now, is to clarify the concepts and show the methodology with its practical application, discussing limitations.}

The eleven papers published in this special issue aim at contributing to the emerging research stream about the sustainable development of I4.0-CE-driven supply chains. In particular, four main macro-topics emerged: (i) I4.0-driven Circular Supply Chains (CSCs); (ii) Life Cycle Information in CE ecosystems; (iii) Waste management process optimisation; (iv) Drivers, challenges, opportunities, and barriers for I4.0-CE-driven supply chains. In the studies included in this special issue collection, novel conceptual frameworks and methodologies are proposed, and some practical cases are also conducted, promoting relevant advances in the twofold field of I4.0-CE, triggering the green and digital twin transition towards a supply chain and social dimension. Nevertheless, the analysis of the papers constituting the special issue reveals promising research opportunities necessary to investigate and explore this emerging domain in its specific facets. More quantitative studies are needed to understand better the dynamics in CSC, CE ecosystems and Industrial Symbiosis networks. Finally, developing specialised circular and sustainable technologies based on intelligent architectures and adopting data-driven approaches could support the adoption of circular practices not only within the companies but also outside them in the CSC and social dimensions.}

In light of the resource and knowledge intensiveness of this often multi-year process, this study draws on paradox theory to identify the main organizational tensions emerging and persisting during the Industry 4.0 transformation of companies in a two-step approach. First, a systematic review of 73 academic papers on organizational challenges in Industry 4.0 adoption is conducted that summarizes 35 key challenges. Second, from these challenges a conceptual framework is built that illustrates the main tensions in Industry 4.0 implementation. The identified organizational tensions are categorized according to the learning, organizing, belonging, and performing categories proposed by the paradox theory. Moreover, resolution strategies to address these tensions have been drawn from the reviewed literature. These strategies are presented and linked to the individual tensions. Finally, tensions and resolution strategies were preliminary validated by a group of Industry 4.0 professionals during a workshop. As a result, the findings provide 23 tensions and 18 related resolution strategies illustrating how organizations can address to competing demands simultaneously when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and thus raise their competitiveness and performance. Based on these results, the article discusses implications for operations management practitioners that can use the proposed framework to inform their strategies and decisions in Industry 4.0 implementation. Moreover, policymakers can adopt the results to develop focussed support actions for driving the Industry 4.0 transition. Finally, four main avenues for future research and implications for operations management scholars are provided.}

This paper provides a different perspective by examining relevant challenges and providing examples of some less-talked-about yet essential topics, such as hybrid systems, redefining advanced manufacturing, basic building blocks of new manufacturing, ecosystem readiness, and technology scalability. The first major challenge is to (re-)define what the manufacturing of the future will be, if we wish to: ① raise public awareness of new manufacturing’s economic and societal impacts, and ② garner the unequivocal support of policy-makers. The second major challenge is to recognize that manufacturing in the future will consist of systems of hybrid systems of human and robotic operators; additive and subtractive processes; metal and composite materials; and cyber and physical systems. Therefore, studying the interfaces between constituencies and standards becomes important and essential. The third challenge is to develop a common framework in which the technology, manufacturing business case, and ecosystem readiness can be evaluated concurrently in order to shorten the time it takes for products to reach customers. Integral to this is having accepted measures of “scalability” of non-information technologies. The last, but not least, challenge is to examine successful modalities of industry–academia–government collaborations through public–private partnerships. This article discusses these challenges in detail.}

Among the several concepts proposed by the recent initiatives devoted to solving or mitigating this issue, Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is increasing in popularity, given its potential in providing standardised and modular information about the assets and events represented. This paper deals with a demonstration of the easiness of integration of AAS in pre-existing software architecture, allowing higher flexibility and a better understanding of the ongoing processes: a production line has been indeed entirely represented with modular AAS metamodels and it has been used to feed a Digital Model representing the line configuration. The use case proposed proves the effectiveness of the obtained solution when used for virtual commissioning operations.}

The I5.0 focuses can face unforeseen challenges, as the applicability and readiness of I4.0 solutions are still not well discussed in the literature. Therefore, structuring existing knowledge of O4.0 to prepare for the smooth transition toward Operator 5.0 (O5.0) is crucial. A systematic literature review is performed in the Scopus database, considering publications up to 31 December 2022. Bibliography Network Analysis (BNA), text mining techniques (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic), and knowledge graph (KG) were deployed on the retrieved abstracts. The full-text examination is carried out over papers matched by LDA and BERTopic. From the BNA result of 279 relevant papers, clusters of active researchers and topics were found, while text-mining results revealed trending and missing research directions. The extracted details from the full text of 81 papers reflected the coverage and development levels of O4.0 types with the preparation for resilience, human-centrism, and sustainability. Achieved results suggest that though the O5.0 transition is inevitable, I4.0 technologies are not ready with sufficient human factor integration. Missing research orientations including integrated sustainability from the human perspective, or system resilience, concerning drivers and restrainers for technology adoption. To prepare for O5.0, discussed O4.0 drivers can help to shape the favorable conditions, and the restrainers should be mitigated before adopting human-centric technologies. Further study including grey literature is necessary to exploit more industrial and policy-making perspectives.}

abstract = {Manufacturing companies across all major industries are facing serious challenges trying to competitively design and manage modern products, which are becoming increasingly complex multi-domain systems or “systems of systems”. Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders’ needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.}

Two major topical clusters have been identified — problem domain-specific AI (e.g., predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and text mining) and organizational-specific AI (e.g., big data capabilities, firm performance, agility, and strategy). Co-word analysis revealed a gradual shift of scholarly interest from problem-domain-specific AI toward organizational-specific AI. Using the citation data, the most influential (cited) authors, (cited) articles, journals, institutions, and countries are identified. Gaps in extant research and future research paths are discussed.}

abstract = {With the permeation of smart devices and connected intelligence in people’s daily life, human–computer interaction is no longer between users and single products, but exists between users and complex product systems. It greatly facilitates the digitalization of user data, environment conditions, and interaction process, which makes digital transformation (DT) feasible in smart home context to help create innovative life services and additional user values. Cross-device interaction has thusly become an important measure in realizing DT in smart home areas, and related studies are growing rapidly. Unlike previous reviews, which mainly focus on the historical development, the applications and evaluation strategies of cross-device interaction, a user-centric perspective was proposed in this work to emphasize the user experience and user values. For the purpose, a systematic literature review approach was developed, and 130 articles in recent 15 years were obtained and reviewed. Through text mining and bibliometric analysis, the topics attracting higher research attention were identified. Following the identified research spots, the related works were analyzed from the aspects of (i) main services supported by cross-device interaction, (ii) common interaction configurations for different service purposes, and (iii) user-perceived values brought by cross-device interaction. Moreover, the challenges which hinder the deepened digitalization of smart home systems were discussed, including data quality, user experience and system safety issues. Accordingly, future development opportunities in the further integration of emerging digital technologies, attempts in natural interaction, and extension of smart home scenarios were suggested. This review is expected to help researchers better understand the role of cross-device interaction in digitalizing a complex smart home system, provide references on effective configuration of interaction systems for different purposes, and shed light on future development directions in this area.}

Industry 4.0, building on the integration of information and communication technologies, Internet of things, robotics, additive manufacturing, and artificial intelligence, aims for developing autonomous and dynamic operations to enable the mass production of highly customized products. Industry 4.0 and quality management share the same objective, that is, improving process performance, yet through different trajectories. However, notwithstanding Industry 4.0 developments, quality management models have remained stagnant and failed to keep abreast of these advancements. This paper evaluates the alignment of quality management models with Industry 4.0. The paper shows that quality models are not congruent with Industry 4.0. The former build on the paradigm that supports establishing formal systems, compliance with specifications, and meeting requirements which are quite irrelevant to Industry 4.0. The paper compares the features of Industry 4.0 against quality models, highlights inadequacies in quality models, and develops recommendations for future quality models. This study is the first to review quality management models in light of the Industry 4.0 developments.}

Historically, quality definitions evolved over time but with significant domain-specific differences. One example of these emerging differences is the human-centric, subjective approach to quality. Current Quality 4.0 models, in most cases, are derivatives from the Total Quality Management (TQM) way, solely based on hopes for Data-Driven approaches to solving problems, with the lack of a human-centric operator approach. Industry 4.0 and its associated digital technologies promise to change this notion and make formerly subjective quality dimensions measurable on a scale as input for design and manufacturing. This leads to an opportunity to bridge the current gap and streamline the Quality and Operator in a holistic, data-informed, and digital technology-enabled way. This paper introduces a Quality 4.0 transformation as a vision for the future of Human – Machine symbiosis in the context of Operator 5.0 for intelligent manufacturing systems. We discuss what needs to be added to Quality 4.0 to achieve the requirements set for Operator 5.0 This work suggests how to enrich smart manufacturing systems from a human-centric perspective with Operator 5.0 making own, informed decisions based on data, experience, and tacit knowledge.}

This unprecedented growth calls for a systematic review of the concept, scope, definition, and functionality of Industry 4.0. Such systematic review should address the existing ambiguities and deliver a clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date overview of this phenomenon, including the possible implications for sustainability. Consistently, the present study carried out a systematic literature review of related articles, published online within the Industry 4.0 discipline until November 2020. The systematic literature review identified 745 eligible articles and applied extensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis methodically. The study provides a descriptive assessment of eligible articles’ properties and offers a unified conceptualization of Industry 4.0 and the underlying building blocks. The study explains how the implications of Industry 4.0 for value creation expand beyond the manufacturing industry. The study further describes the sustainability value drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and identifies the conditions on which digital industrial transformation success lays. Overall, findings reveal that Industry 4.0 transformation could address pressing issues of sustainable development goals, particularly concerning the manufacturing-economic development. The study also draws on the findings and offers important theoretical and practical implications, highlights the existing gaps within the literature, and discusses the possible future research directions.}

Undoubtedly, this huge population jump and migration of people to urban areas cause the emergence of different challenges such as sustainable development, increasing environmental pollution, equality, poverty alleviation, job creation, energy supply, water resources management, food supply, waste recycling, education, health, and security. Overcoming these conditions requires a change in traditional methods of urban management and a move toward the use of new technologies in all pillars of urban management. One of the available solutions is to create or develop smart cities to take advantage of new digital capacities and rely on the principles of industry 4.0 to manage complex situations and prevent possible anomalies. In this book chapter, the evolution of smart cities platforms along with industrial revolutions is reviewed, and the key points of policies applicable in the field of smart cities using industry 4.0 (city 4.0) are stated. Simultaneous attention to the financial effects and smart cities policy in the fourth generation of the different industrial revolution is the key highlight of this chapter that can be considered by policymakers in creating or developing smart cities.}

abstract = {Aquaponics, one of the vertical farming methods, is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains’ knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to represent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology provides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system’s knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision-making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.}

Building meaning through a lens of practices that orchestrate capabilities to achieve business and operational objectives makes it possible to describe SM itself as set of practices that distinguish it from today’s 40-year history of applying IT to manufacturing. Key practices at SM’s core are centered on: business and technology; seams and an OT/IT journey; OT/IT enterprise workflow modeling; cyberinfrastructure and reference architecture; and workforce, innovation, and marketplace.}

abstract = {Recently, Indian manufacturing industries have undergone a significant transformation emphasising customer-centric objectives to meet the dynamic market's demands. To achieve this, existing industries must upgrade their existing infrastructure to a smart environment driven by automatic data exchange, transparency, and interconnected digital systems. These are the key enabling elements of Industry 4.0. As a result, many Indian industries are developing various sophisticated implementation strategies for adopting it. However, few research works and strategies contribute to its effective and successful implementation. This paper proposes two types of implementation strategies for implementing Industry 4.0 enabling technologies based on the requirements and adaptability of India's commercial vehicle manufacturing industry. The first strategy identifies various aspects of implementing Industry 4.0 enabling framework elements and categorizes it for developing implementation strategies based on India's commercial vehicle manufacturing industry. The significance of each was determined using fuzzy-AHP analysis and ranked accordingly based on the linguistic responses of the industry experts. The most significant framework element is found to be ‘Decision Making and Management Skills’. The second strategy emphasizes long-term sustainable implementation objectives. The framework elements are reconstructed and developed into a novel, customized sustainable framework based on six dimensions of sustainability. Using the Fuzzy-DEMATEL method, the causal relationships among these elements are investigated to determine a sustainable implementation strategy. ‘Central Database Server’ is determined to be the most significant sustainable framework element, while the maximum number of casual relationships is obtained from the group, ‘Skill upgradation of the workforce’. This paper proposes a novel research direction for implementing Industry 4.0 technologies into the existing industry. The findings provide several insights and strategies for technological upgradation in other industries in this geographical region. The findings of the work enhance the implementation process of I4.0 technologies, transitioning it from a conventional approach to a futuristic sustainable implementation that is economical and effective.}

Research on ESG is still evolving. Although a few studies have investigated the role of individual technologies (e.g., blockchain) in ESG, applying a broader set of emerging technologies in improving ESG disclosure and addressing its limitations is yet to be explored. Industry 5.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the role of technologies in enhancing ESG disclosure. This conceptual paper explains ESG from the lens of management theories and views, including stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, transaction cost economics theory, institutional theory, signaling theory, network economics theory, and the decoupling view. It then explores the application of I5.0 in enhancing ESG disclosure. The underlying values of I5.0 align with those of ESG, and I5.0 can support ESG functionalities. I5.0 is particularly useful in enhancing ESG disclosure authenticity, extending ESG disclosure from retrospective to prospective and real-time reporting, customizing ESG reports, extending the scope of reporting to multi-tier supply chains, reducing ESG cost, and enhancing the overall efficacy of ESG disclosure. The paper also sheds light on governance aspects, challenges, and risks of employing I5.0 to ESG.}

The case study is based on a densely populated metropolis with an extensive education system. The city's decision-makers will have to weigh the pros and cons of the Metaverse's effect on traffic safety. To illustrate the complex forces that drive the decision-making process in traffic safety, we create a case study with four alternatives to Metaverse's integration into the traffic system. Alternatives are evaluated using twelve criteria that reflect the decision problem's rules and regulations, technology, socioeconomic, and traffic aspects. In this study, fuzzy Einstein based logarithmic methodology of additive weights (LMAW) is applied to calculate the weights of the criteria. We present a new framework that combines Einstein norms and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to rank the alternatives. The findings of this study show that public transportation is the most appropriate area for implementing the Metaverse into traffic safety because of its practical opportunities and broad usage area.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is about realizing digital transformation by linking machines to plants, fleets, and humans through sensors and control elements in order to create smart networks, smart factories, smart manufacturing, and smart value chains. By leveraging I4.0 technologies, a small and medium enterprise (SME) can increase its organizational agility, adaptability, and resilience to cope with today's competitive environment by becoming a valuable and innovative partner in the power dynamics with its large buyer counterparts. However, SMEs face technology, trust, and big data challenges when they adopt I4.0 technologies. This study provides new solutions for SMEs to overcome these three challenges in implementing I4.0. Specifically, the paper proposes the following: (1) a roadmap for the application of I4.0 technologies to enhance the collaboration capabilities of SMEs; (2) a structure for I4.0 standardization to develop and sustain trust among partners; and (3) an improved data science platform for systematizing big data to extract critical information for collaboration solutions for SMEs. Additionally, the solutions are evaluated based on an application case of a Greek SME, demonstrating their potentials for practical implementation.}

abstract = {Reconfigurable Pilot Lines (RPLs) are one practical concept for implementing the test-before-invest strategy to improve skills and capabilities of European small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs typically have limited resources for systematically exploring the potential benefits of available technologies. By utilizing the RPLs offered by research institutes and universities, companies can get both commercially uncommitted and realistic proof-of-concept studies for their applications, and valuable information about the skills and personnel competences needed for successful implementation of the new technologies. Test-before-invest services offered by RPLs can also foster the process of adopting new digital technologies in manufacturing industry. RPLs are versatile. RPL can act as a test bed for manufacturing company’s investment study, industry-scale product development laboratory for technology provider, as well as a platform for scientific research and education. Due to versatile roles and functions, defining pilot line requirements specifications call for systematic contribution from both industry and academia. This paper introduces a collaborative approach for defining requirements specifications for RPLs from the future technology skills development perspective. As a basis for this research, we combine results of three joined industry-academia workshops and one academic workshop with total 87 participants utilizing Affinity Wall method. This data was supplemented with an online survey for 74 companies from manufacturing industry. The analysis indicates that defining requirements specifications and development roadmaps for RPLs is a complex process, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration. Based on the analysis, a conceptual model supporting the requirements specification work is proposed in this paper. The model was applied to an existing testbed environment for further evaluation.}

However, data may be easily stolen by criminals during the transmission process. We propose a three-factor enhanced protocol to monitor patient body information and mitigate the issues. The proposed protocol can provide the confidentiality of transmitted data and the privacy of doctors and patients. The security of the proposed protocol is demonstrated in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) for computational security. In addition, by comparing the proposed protocol with other related works, our designed protocol has efficient performance both in execution time and communication costs.}

This paper presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing, assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally, a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are discussed to provide guidelines for future applications.}

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has shown itself capable of contributing to the development or reformulation of organizational processes to make them more competitive and sustainable. Thus, this article aims to propose drivers for the development of corporate sustainability via I4.0. To this end, a literature review and content analysis were used as research methods to identify and analyze, in recent scientific literature, boosting elements that enable organizational processes to become more sustainable via I4.0. Based on these elements, six drivers were systematized and proposed: strategy; product and process design; energy and material resources; people; smart production; and supply chain. Each driver was discussed in light of the scientific literature to generate recommendations for companies to develop the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The main theoretical-scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and expansion of the knowledge block that articulates corporate sustainability with I4.0, which strengthens the basis for the development of new research on these topics and creates a reference for the analysis and discussion of empirical studies. As an applied-managerial contribution, the drivers proposed in this work will provide organizations and their managers with a point of reference to effectively move towards sustainability, making their businesses greener, fairer, and more profitable. A limitation of this study is that the proposed drivers were based on the 30 most cited articles and did not consider other sources, such as documentation from companies. Therefore, for future studies, we suggest increasing the article base and include organizational repositories and identify how SMEs can become sustainable through I4.0 in a way that strengthens the social dimension of sustainability.}

In such domain, the search for “agility” has come to be one of the most requested features. As a result, considerable research has been conducted to design manufacturing systems which embody manufacturing flexibility. It is in this context where the evolution of the supply-chain based concept of Mini Factories is relevant, as it allows a network-like interconnectivity between assets by setting up factories inside the premises of the principal manufacturer. It is stated that at the core of Industry 4.0 implementation, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the bridge between the physical world and the IoT world or, in other words, the data model from where the digital twin stems from. In this paper we present a methodology to create Asset Administrative Shells in a Mini Factories context. We argue that our approach, effectively embodies concepts related to Industry 4.0 in a modular way, allowing the much-desired agility. By using our proposed methodology, Model Factory @ARTC has been able to create a seamless integration of assets into our factory of the future, demonstrating the connectivity and some of the enhanced capabilities of Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {In today's competitive landscape, maintenance is one of the critical functions that may greatly benefit from digital transformation (DT). Advances in technological developments are proving to be a game changer for improving maintenance strategies and practices. However, several challenges related to the lack of adequate managerial aspects, and adoption of wrong approaches to this transformation hinder its success. Research has shown that technology alone is not sufficient for organizations to ensure the success of their digitalization attempts. Therefore, the aim of this research is to adopt a holistic approach to identify, evaluate and rank a comprehensive list of the various influencing variables, multifaceted in nature, that drive the success of maintenance DT initiatives. To that end, the authors solicited the different success factors based on a systematic literature review, then conducted a purification phase of these enablers and categorized them. Subsequently, a hybrid reactive Delphi approach, combined with AHP method, was adopted to evaluate and rank the success factors and their corresponding clusters through a panel of 17 highly qualified experts. The verified final list includes 41 factors mapped into 10 categories. The clusters are ranked according to their relative level of importance, and normalized weights are attributed to their factors. In particular, “Digital strategy - strategic alignment” cluster ranked highest followed by “Top management and leadership skills” then “Organizational development and change management”. The findings of this study contribute to enriching the extant literature, serve as a foundation to conduct further academic research, and provide proper guidance to practitioners in this field.}

abstract = {The continuing expansion of connected and electro-mobility products and services has led to their ability to rapidly generate very large amounts of data, leading to a demand for effective data management solutions. This is further catalysed through the need for society to make informed policies and decisions that can properly support their emerging growth. While data systems and platforms exist, they are often proprietary, being only compatible to the products that they are designed for. Given the products and services generate energy and spatial-temporal data that can often correlate, a lack of interoperability between these systems would impede decision making, as data from each system must be considered independently. By studying currently available data platforms and frameworks, this paper weighs the problems that these products address, and identifies necessary gaps for a more cohesive platform to exist. This is performed through a top-down approach, whereby broader vehicle-to-everything approaches are first studied, before moving to the components that could comprise a data platform to integrate and ingest these various data feeds. Finally, potential design considerations for a data platform is presented, along with examples of application benefits that would enable users to make more informed and holistic decisions about current mobility options.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 was introduced with the hope of transitioning to the next industrial revolution. I4.0 is a vision of increasing flexibility and efficiency within a system of low complexity. Despite this intention, Industry 4.0 has required users to understand complex information and communication systems, limiting usability and therefore not necessarily satisfying the original vision. However, application of principles from the Lean Production Systems originally developed in the 1930’s in combination with Industry 4.0, may help to reach its desired goals. Through a literature review, this paper discusses the current state of art of Industry 4.0 and some Lean Production Systems principles. The paper focuses on a model combining Lean Production Systems with Industry 4.0, that was created in response to the shortcomings of the anticipated industrial revolution. With a Lean Production System as a foundation, the six design principles of I4.0 of interoperability, virtualization, decentralization, real-time capability, service orientation, and modularity can be better implemented to reach the vision of highly flexible and low complexity systems. In return, horizontal and vertical integration within Industry 4.0 can support and accelerate Lean principles by reducing human error and increasing intercommunications between the systems, resulting in a productive integration. The specific principles of Lean that could boost Industry 4.0 will be discussed, demonstrating why a company should be Lean, meaning value adding processes and stakeholder orientation are at its core.}

This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of interdisciplinary research on EC applications in SG. First, an in-depth analysis of EC, including the definition, architectures, characteristics, and key enabling technologies is conducted from the perspective of SG application requirements. Afterward, this paper systematically explores application scenarios of EC in SG based on its characteristics. Beyond that, the synergistic effect of the integration of EC and SG is also assessed: SG not only benefits from EC but also supports EC to become sustainable.

Development of CPMT requires standardized information modelling method and communication protocols for machine tools. This paper proposes a CPMT Platform based on OPC UA and MTConnect that enables standardized, interoperable and efficient data communication among machine tools and various types of software applications. First, a development method for OPC UA-based CPMT is proposed based on a generic OPC UA information model for CNC machine tools. Second, to address the issue of interoperability between OPC UA and MTConnect, an MTConnect to OPC UA interface is developed to transform MTConnect information model and its data to their OPC UA counterparts. An OPC UA-based CPMT prototype is developed and further integrated with a previously developed MTConnect-based CPMT to establish a common CPMT Platform. Third, different applications are developed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CPMT Platform, including an OPC UA Client, an advanced AR-assisted wearable Human-Machine Interface and a conceptual framework for CPMT powered cloud manufacturing environment. Experimental results have proven that the proposed CPMT Platform can significantly improve the overall production efficiency and effectiveness in the shop floor.}

In this regard, the work aims to guide the data integration development of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes under the Industry 4.0 framework, improving digital maturity and enabling the development of digital twins. This paper demonstrates two instances where a data integration framework has been successfully employed in academic continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing pilot plants. Details of the integration structure and information flows are comprehensively showcased. Approaches to mitigate concerns in incorporating complex data streams, including integrating multiple process analytical technology tools and legacy equipment, connecting cloud data and simulation models, and safeguarding cyber-physical security, are discussed.

It is a challenging process that requires to overcome intrinsic remanufacturing barriers or challenges, while addressing sustainability concerns, and achieving business model (BM) objectives. The lack of product life cycle information (PLCI) is the main source of these issues, generating significant inefficiencies and negative impacts in CM operations. Smart and industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies have the ability to recover, process, and analyze PLCI. In fact, research is ongoing and suggested approaches are focused on implementing CM strategies using I4.0 to address reverse logistic issues, and to develop new BMs for CM. However, questions remain about on how to structure and configure these technologies as a smart architecture (SA) that simultaneously addresses: 1) remanufacturing barriers and challenges; 2) sustainability; and 3) BMs in the context of CM. The present study addresses this question by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) to discuss current approaches, identify challenges and opportunities, and to improve understanding of SAs for CM strategies. Based on these SLR findings, this study proposes a novel conceptual design of a SA for a sustainable manufacturing-remanufacturing system towards Industry 5.0. As well, the proposed SA covers novel elements, such as a sustainable stakeholders focus, a modular customizable structure integrated in BM, and a blockchain quality and remanufacturability certificate, that are typically omitted or only partially considered by other studies. Finally, a case study based on an electric motor is used to illustrate the relevance, capabilities, and utilization of the proposed architecture.}

In particular, human-robot collaboration in assembly will be particularly interesting for manufacturing companies. In this context, the interaction between humans and robots opens new possibilities but also challenges. A major problem is related to safety: unwanted and unexpected contacts between the human and the robotic system may cause injuries and therefore limit the potential for collaboration. Nowadays, there is a lack of simple and practical tools for helping system designers in overcoming such limiting conditions. In this work, guidelines for the design of safe human-robot collaborative assembly are developed and classified, particularly focusing on the features characterizing the entire system. These are validated by means of a laboratory case study and a digital twin. The validation process is based on the assumption that a team of manufacturing engineers (not-experts in occupational health and safety) should be able to autonomously and gradually apply the given guidelines reducing the mechanical risk in a collaborative assembly system. The proposed solutions have been virtually modelled allowing the evaluation of their effectiveness. According to the results, the proposed guidelines effectively help non-expert users in the development and improvement of collaborative assembly systems from the safety perspective.}

Thus, the ‘Industry 4.0’ can be an enabler for industrial sustainable development. Maintenance processes, which are fundamental for ensuring sustainable operation of manufacturing systems, can benefit from these technologies, with a consequent improvement of maintenance and manufacturing performance. Therefore, a strong synergy between I4.0 technologies and industrial maintenance processes for promoting sustainable manufacturing occurs. Nevertheless, to date, no study investigates thoroughly the effects of such potential synergy on sustainable manufacturing. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, identifying the relation between maintenance processes and I4.0 technologies; then, analysing the positive effects of their integration on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable manufacturing. Finally, a preliminary analysis was also conducted to shed light on the negative effects of this synergy on sustainability.}
