abstract = {Sharing Economy promotes Shared Manufacturing (SharedMfg) that allows self-organized individuals to get involved in manufacturing activities through peer-to-peer (P2P) collaborations. It extends the scope and depth of resources sharing and enables society-based manufacturing integration. SharedMfg is complex and is still in its infancy. It demands encouraging research to clarify the concept and understand the key operations. In this paper, the SharedMfg is analysed along with two significant manufacturing evolutional trends, (i.e., Servitization and Industry 4.0). Based on this, to reduce the complexities in operations, the concept and definition of SharedMfg are presented on the basis of a service hierarchy that includes Product-Service System, Configuration-Service System and Resource-Service System. At the same time, this paper looks SharedMfg as an independent socialization manufacturing mode (e.g. compared with Cloud Manufacturing), and also, the benefit in contributing to the integration of the manufacturing and service sectors is revealed. However, apart from the complexity, high-degree dynamics and uncertainties related to service operations challenge the application of SharedMfg as well. To meet both requirements, based on the construction of a three-dimensional SharedMfg Service (SMS) modelling framework, a hybrid integration and interoperable SharedMfg architecture is proposed to ensure the provision of SMS in efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, a dynamic SMS scheduling method in support of the technologies of Complex Network Analysis is presented. A case study associated with the networked fabrication of an assistive glove is applied by implementing a prototype system to validate the proposed frameworks and methods. Finally, an experiment for evaluating the efficiency of service matching is carried out to prove the SharedMfg that can provide better performance than Cloud Manufacturing and Social Manufacturing.}

abstract = {Unlike previous reviews, most of which focus on a field and use qualitative methods to analyze blockchain technology, herein main path analysis was used to determine the key route of citations and identify the developmental trajectories of blockchain technology and its major themes. A total of 3159 blockchain-related articles published through August 5, 2019, were gathered from the Web of Science. In all, 2478 articles formed the citation network, 27 of which were on the key route. These 27 key papers on blockchain represented the four developmental stages. Stage 1 focused on challenges to bitcoin. Stage 2 focused on smart contract issues. Stage 3 focused on opportunities, challenges, and development in blockchain. Finally, Stage 4 focused on smart contract applications, especially in e-healthcare, where blockchain technology is paving the way to a quicker, more secure, and more efficient means of storing and accessing medical data. The Girvan-Newman clustering technique was used to classify articles, and keyword analysis was used to analyze the top six major themes. These were bitcoin security, bitcoin financial applications, e-healthcare, Ethereum smart contracts, security and privacy in IoT, and energy. Main path analysis was also used to analyze their developmental trends. The results have significant value for both academics and practitioners.}

The article proposes a definition for the capabilities maturity levels of the mobility ecosystem, and functional architecture for the collaborative decision-making system for implementing the C-ITS in the future Smart Cities. The paper contributes to the literature and practice in four manners. The first one is enhancing the awareness and understanding of maturity capability model (CMM) for all the stakeholders throughout the mobility ecosystem, emphasizing the key capabilities required for each maturity level. The second way is manifested throughout public and private companies acting on the same territory in the mobility ecosystem assess the existing capabilities and collaborate for achieving a superior maturity level of mobility processes, stable and repeatable results. In addition, the third one, based on CMM, is that governments regulate, conduct and control, establishing a stable and mature processes institutionalization for C-ITS. Finally, the fourth practice is defining a C-ITS functional architecture for the future Smart Cities to support collaborative decision-making applied for public transport implementation in big Smart Cities with the final objective of increasing the citizen’s quality of life.}

Although automation and assistance technologies are becoming more prevalent in production and logistics, there is consensus that humans will remain an essential part of operations systems. Nevertheless, human factors are still underrepresented in this research stream resulting in an important research and application gap. This article first exposes this gap by presenting the results of a focused content analysis of earlier research on Industry 4.0. To contribute to closing this gap, it then develops a conceptual framework that integrates several key concepts from the human factors engineering discipline that are important in the context of Industry 4.0 and that should thus be considered in future research in this area. The framework can be used in research and development to systematically consider human factors in Industry 4.0 designs and implementations. This enables the analysis of changing demands for humans in Industry 4.0 environments and contributes towards a successful digital transformation that avoid the pitfalls of innovation performed without attention to human factors. The paper concludes with highlighting future research directions on human factors in Industry 4.0 as well as managerial implications for successful applications in practice.}

We contribute to establishing a cumulative body of knowledge by conducting such an SLR. We synthesize 221 articles published on 11 Industry 4.0 technologies between 2005 and 2021. Rather than aggregate implications, our SLR presents the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of each core technology vis-à-vis supply chain performance individually. We integrate our findings into a framework of Industry 4.0 supply chain performance and derive promising avenues for future research. Specifically, we call for more research on (a) the challenges and critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; (b) hitherto underexplored core technologies of the Industry 4.0; (c) the interaction of multiple core technologies (are they complements or substitutes?); as well as for (d) further consolidation and interdisciplinary dissemination efforts.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

Nonetheless, human cognitive input still plays a critical role in the operation of process plants and replication of these cognitive capabilities remains a key challenge for advancing automation levels. In this paper, we provide an analysis of process and energy industries based on a scenario of reduced availability of skilled labour and increased demands for safety, sustainability, and resilience. We consider the different mechanical, sensing, situational awareness, and decision-making tasks involved in the operation of plants and map them to possible realisations of unmanned and autonomous systems. We discuss the implications of current technology capabilities and future technology development perspectives, the factors influencing the complexity of operation in process plants, and the importance of human-machine collaboration. As part of autonomous system capabilities, we consider adaptation as a key capability and we make a connection to adaptation of model-based solutions. We argue that reaching higher and wider levels of autonomy requires a rethink of the design processes for both the physical plants as well as the way automation, control, and safety solutions are conceptualised.}

As an antithetical point, there is a structural duality between using BCT in the electrical grid due to its advantages and energy consumption. To this end, this research work is an inclination toward controlling the miner’s energy consumption based on a realistic and efficacious two-stage energy mechanism toward the distributed energy concept and optimal placement of data mining devices. In this circumstance, such a new structure allows miners to mainly sustain their hash rates as a prominent index for security achievement and optimally decrease their cost. This paper suggests a novel distributed model for miners coincided with the smart electrical grid getting inspired by the Prima-Dual Method of Multipliers (PDMM) based distributed approach to settle down the needed power bartering between miners and energy supply resources. In addition, for a similar purpose, it seems to reach the ideal resolution needs to perform the modified reaffirmation of miners (the mining pool) within the secured grid. To execute this task, this research recommends the Intelligent Priority Selection (IPS) techniques as well. When all is said and done, the result of this approach can aid researchers with performing in the field of improving social advantages by the usage of the suggested method.}

Despite its proclaimed effectiveness in supply chain (SC) management, empirical studies examining the effects of Industry 4.0 adoption on SC resilience have been underrepresented in the current OM literature. In our study, we explore the effects of 16 Industry 4.0 technologies and IT advancement concerning SC resilience through the mediating roles of SC capabilities with respect to SC collaboration and SC visibility. Following the dynamic resource-based view (RBV), we regard Industry 4.0 adoption and IT advancement as two important IT resources with heterogeneity, SC collaboration and SC visibility as essential SC dynamic capabilities, and SC resilience as competitive advantages. We suggest the combination and evolution of IT resources and dynamic SC capabilities helps firms obtain the competitive advantage regarding SC resilience. Using data from a survey of 408 Chinese manufacturing firms, we reveal Industry 4.0 adoption is positively related to IT advancement and that Industry 4.0 has a nonsignificant impact on SC capabilities, whereas IT advancement has a positive impact on SC capabilities. Additionally, both SC collaboration and visibility positively influence SC resilience and significantly mediate the impacts of Industry 4.0 and IT advancement on SC resilience. Our study offers an enhanced understanding of the specific flows between Industry 4.0 and SC resilience and provides nuanced insights for both literature and practice.}

The study adopts a systematic literature review approach to systematize such knowledge in a singular and consolidated perspective on Industry 4.0 technologies and work. The study analyzes 80 papers in this field and investigates how different Industry 4.0 technologies are related to workers’ manufacturing activities. Eight main manufacturing activities were considered to frame the analysis: assembly, maintenance, training, quality control, movement, machine operation, product and process design, and production planning and control. Eight worker capabilities that Industry 4.0 technologies can enhance were also considered: super-strength capability, augmented capability, virtual capability, healthy capability, smart capability, collaborative, social capability, analytical capability. Based on these 80 papers, this paper conceptualizes Smart Working-related technologies for Operators 4.0 and shows their benefits and limitations as described in the literature. The study shows how these manufacturing activities and worker capabilities can be supported by Industry 4.0 technologies, which is useful for future research and the design of operational processes in the Industry 4.0 context.}

Despite the increasing global policy focus on CE, research on the role of digital government in initiating, implementing, and consolidating a transition towards a circular economy is surprisingly scarce and fragmented, and a systematic effort in digital government research is yet to emerge. To tackle this issue, this article sets out to answer the research question: what is the role of digital government in the transition towards a circular economy? Driven by this research question, we conduct a review on 88 empirical studies in the Information Systems (IS) and digital government fields and discuss existing research foci and gaps in relation to the types of digital technologies used, the types of stakeholders involved, the stages of the product life cycle, and the type of resources that governments draw on to advance the circular economy transition. In addition, we identify two types of transition styles, based on an analysis of the types of roles taken by the government in two cases of transition towards a circular economy. Based on these findings, we provide two contributions to establishing a new line of research in digital government and the circular economy: an analytical framework, including a static view, a longitudinal view, and a transition style view of the role of digital government in the circular economy transition; and a research agenda that builds on our framework, to guide future research on the role of digital government in the circular economy transition.}

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).}

As a result, once an attacker has gained access, they have full control of the entire production plant because of the lack of network segmentation. With the goal of raising cybersecurity awareness, in this paper we describe a practical case study showing attack scenarios that we have validated on a real modular smart manufacturing system, and suggest practical security counter measures. The testbed smart manufacturing system is part of the Industry 4.0 research laboratory hosted by Politecnico di Milano, and comprises seven assembly stations, each with their programmable logic controllers and human-computer interfaces, as well as an industrial robotic arm that performs pick-and-place tasks. On this testbed we show two indirect attacks to gain initial access, even under the best-case scenario of a system not directly connected to any public network. We conclude by showing two post-exploitation scenarios that an adversary can use to cause physical impact on the production, or keep persistent access to the plant. We are unaware of a similar security analysis performed within the premises of a research facility, following a scientific methodology, so we believe that this work can represent a good first step to inspire follow up research on the many verticals that we touch.}

Governments and companies invest billions of dollars in technologies to convert, harvest, rising demand, changing demand and supply patterns, efficiency, lack of analytics required for optimal energy planning, and store energy. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently. Moreover, policy recommendations, research opportunities, and how industry 4.0 will improve sustainability have been briefly described.}

At the same time, digital solutions have proven essential in improving safety, quality of life, and resilience in daily life. However, the lower population density and the lack of digital infrastructure in such rural areas make it difficult to develop technology-driven private businesses and public services. This can negatively impact socio-economic indicators and hinder the development of new services to cover peoples’ needs. For this reason, in this document, we seek to provide a stronger focus on rural regions in digitalization efforts and create new opportunities for rural communities. For that, we analyze the barriers and needs of the rural environment and present AURORAL, a digital service platform designed to meet the needs and contexts of rural areas. This ecosystem, comprising sustainable and multi-interoperable apps and services, can help communities succeed in innovation and smart transformation, providing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate long-lasting social, environmental, and economic benefits by prioritizing openness, interoperability, and decentralization. On the principle that the full potential of these technologies can only be realized when they are integrated into societal and economic activity and organization, AURORAL aims to promote economic growth and digitalization in the rural domain and contribute to bridging the digital divide between rural and urban areas.}

In this editorial, we call for a more instrumental approach, one that effectively serves the needs of practitioners in the field of technological innovation as well as scholars seeking to increase their impact on innovation practice. In this respect, design science (DS) methodologies have emerged in various adjacent domains such as information systems, operations management, and entrepreneurship. Inspired by Simon's “The Sciences of the Artificial”, DS operates at the interface of problem-solving design and explanatory science to create and test solutions as artifacts. Whereas DS work can result in various kinds of artifacts, tools for practitioners are the most promising ones. We first provide several examples of DS work resulting in widely used tools and then identify various challenges in the technological innovation domain that call for tools addressing these challenges. Subsequently, we provide practical guidance on how to prepare manuscripts about designing and testing tools which are likely to have a major impact on practice.}

Recent development of Internet of Things has enabled traditional battery management system (BMS) to evolve into battery cloud. A battery cloud or cloud-BMS leverages the cloud computational power and data storage to improve battery safety, performance, and economy. This work will present the battery cloud that collects measured battery data from electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Advanced algorithms are applied to improve battery performance. Using remote vehicle data, we train and validate an artificial neural network to estimate pack state of charge during vehicle charging. The strategy is then tested on vehicles. Furthermore, high accuracy and onboard battery state-of-health (SOH) estimation methods for electric vehicles are developed based on the differential voltage (DVA) and incremental capacity analysis (ICA). Using cycling data from battery cells at various temperatures, we extract the charging cycles and calculate the DVA and ICA curves, from which multiple features are extracted, analyzed, and eventually used to estimate the battery’s SOH. For battery safety, a data-driven thermal anomaly detection method is developed. The method can detect unforeseen anomalies such as thermal runaways at the very early stage. Potential applications of battery cloud also include areas such as battery manufacture, recycling, and electric vehicle battery swap.}

The underwater monitoring of the oceans and their surroundings is highly crucial from several perspectives, e.g., to unearth the hidden minerals/oils, to monitor the life of underwater species, military and rescue applications, surveillance of maritime borders, and predict tidal wave behaviors among others. The exploration and inspection activities of the underwater environment are mainly performed remotely by unmanned underwater vehicles or robots because human direct involvement in such a complex environment might not be a feasible option. Moreover, the recent maturity in digital automation and underwater drone technology along with the emergence and improvements in wireless, communication, and sensing technologies had already encouraged the research community to drive deep into this domain. Among several disruptive enabling technologies, Blockchain has emerged as a vital enabling technology to fulfil key requirements for secure data sharing, storage, process tracking, collaboration, and resource management. This study presents a comprehensive review of the utilization of Blockchain in different underwater applications, discussing various use cases along with detailing blockchain-based architectures, potential challenges, solutions, and future research directions. Potential challenges of underwater applications addressed by Blockchain have been detailed. This work identifies knowledge gaps between theoretical research and real-time Blockchain integration in realistic underwater drone applications. The key limitations for effective integration of Blockchain in real-time integration in Unmanned Underwater Drones (UUD) applications, along with directions for future research have been presented.}

Digital technologies also improve predictive and preventive maintenance on the shop floor and across the supply chain, increasing the overall resilience of manufacturing industries in times of crisis. This article proposes a blueprint of a collaborative, decentralised approach to human rights due diligence in digital supply chains.

However, a serious problem caused by this pattern is that the data owner loses control of the data. In this case, to ensure outsourced storage data integrity, researchers proposed Provable Data Possession. However, most systems cannot deal with disagreements between entities throughout the process. Due to this, we propose an auditing system for outsourced data. By using undeniable blockchain information, it solves disputes between entities and avoids accounting delays by third-party auditors. A credit chain based on the public blockchain is designed. A novel dynamic credit calculation algorithm is adopted in the credit chain to realize an effective reward and punishment mechanism. Security proofs are provided in detail for the proposed scheme. Evaluation experiments show that compared with existing similar schemes, the scheme achieves arbitrable audit and has a lower computational cost.}

However, these offerings seldom enhance revenue, because companies struggle with business model (BM) dynamics. By analyzing 27 companies through an explorative case-study approach, the authors consider how companies can successfully achieve revenue enhancement through digital offerings. The result is a threefold framework for revenue enhancement through digital offerings. First, this framework distinguishes between three phases of BM dynamics: 1) augmenting products through a “hardware plus” logic, 2) developing a portfolio of multiple logics for creating customer value, 3) integrating this portfolio through platform logic. Second, the framework emphasizes that three barriers, which we refer to as confidence, mixing, and collaboration barrier, limit the progress from Phases 1 to 3. Third, the framework reveals that each phase contains certain modifications of BM components. In the first phase, companies adapt their BM components slightly, so as to advance toward a “hardware plus” logic. In the second phase, companies embrace more radical BM innovations in order to convert services into an outcome-based BM and develop a new software subscription BM. In the third phase, companies modify BM components in order to integrate the BMs internally and to open them up for external collaboration partners.}

Following the trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions. Finally, future research directions are expounded to set the floor for further advancements in the blockchainized 6G.}

However, the implementation of CI in manufacturing systems poses several challenges, including interoperability issues and the complexity of communication and coordination between heterogeneous manufacturing resources. These challenges can be addressed by integrating cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) and distributed artificial intelligence. Therefore, this paper presents a framework for enabling the emergence of CI in industrial CPSS to achieve collaborative task allocation and defect detection. The framework infuses intelligence into physical manufacturing resources through CPSS configuration and establishes real-time collaborative communication coupled with decentralized decision-making using a multi-agent system. Additionally, an online deep Q-network (DQN) is employed to train a smart scheduler agent for self-organized assignment of manufacturing tasks to machines. The proposed method is implemented in a 3D printing factory testbed. Experimental findings demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method, which has been deployed in the 3D printing factory for a few months and has reduced production costs, defects, and nonconformities in 3D printed parts.}

As new services become possible due to these characteristics, attempts to present promising future services based on 6G technology are occurring in academia and industry. However, because 6G technology has a very wide range of applications as a fundamental technology, 6G service scenario research is also being conducted for each sector. To predict 6G technology use in the future, it is necessary to understand comprehensively the scenarios being studied sporadically by sector. Therefore, we aim to derive major service scenarios by analyzing in-depth public data for 6G service scenarios. We collected research papers, corporate reports, and news articles on 6G service scenarios and performed topic modeling to derive four major domains and 16 application areas. Afterward, the derived service's feasibility and promising scenario were evaluated by utilizing the future-context canvas and business model canvas that analyze the service's value from the user's and supplier's perspectives, respectively. The research results are expected to support technology development and business planning in the field by enhancing understanding of 6G service scenarios.}

abstract = {In today’s competitive scenario, the manufacturing industries are lagging behind in implementing the Industry 4.0 concept or in integrating smart, ubiquitous components due to high cost and high energy consumption due to the volatile market. The digital transformation has reshaped the manufacturing industries and has paved the way towards data-driven, intelligent, networked, and resilient manufacturing systems. In this context, Industry 4.0 is progressing exponentially and offers a productive output in terms of circular economy and cleaner production to attain ethical business by achieving accuracy, precision, and efficiency. Hence, there is a strong requirement to revamp the traditional manufacturing set-ups into smart manufacturing to gain self-adaptability, reliability, and flexibility with high quality and low-cost output. The paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for Industry 4.0 set-up to achieve circular economy and cleaner production by optimizing products-machine allocation. The proposed MILP model optimizes the trade-off between energy consumption and machine processing cost to gain a circular economy and cleaner production respectively. The proposed model also achieves ethical business by deploying sensors to capture real-time information to establish the Industry 4.0 facility. The paper discusses the product-machine specific analysis to optimize the manufacturing of customized and high-end products at low production cost with minimal energy consumption. The objective of the paper is to minimize the total cost and energy consumption of machines for establishing the Industry 4.0 facility to gain a circular economy and cleaner production. The proposed model is demonstrated and computationally tested on small, moderate, and large data instances and presented with their detailed analysis.}

To this end, the current paper aims to provide a research agenda reviewing the relevant literature that touches on smart technologies during emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic methodology centred on text mining analysis, our research identified the following three themes: (a) emergency response, which covers emergency management, traffic and unmanned aerial vehicles, waste disposal, and contact tracing; (b) motivation and outcome, which includes such sub-themes as smart urbanism, quality of life and the economy; and (c) technology and data, which covers social media, machine learning, Internet of Things, data-driven applications, and object detection. We comprehensively discuss each theme and offer suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {Abstract – Novel methods are needed to make industrial plants more resilient to disruptions. Those disruptions are usually originating from both internal and external environment. Therefore, in the industrial environment, it is getting increasingly important to obtain an accurate overview of the functions of a production system (PS). Likewise, monitoring of production processes are also getting increasingly important due to the increasing interconnectedness of PSs. While causes of malfunctions in most PS being unintentionally and not easily caught a priori, early detection of malfunctions is important from an economic and a safety point of view. Current evaluation methods are primarily oriented towards the analysis of plant components. They do not consider, a change in product quality when it comes to the analysis of the reduction or the analysis of sabotage. The article outlines a methodology for evaluating the performance of a PS and identifying the causes of any disturbances. This methodology is based on a combination of risk analysis approaches, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and security analysis approaches, such as the VDI 2182 procedure model. Furthermore, the methodology presented in this article establishes a cyclic approach that helps to reduce the susceptibility of a PS failure. To verify the effectiveness of the methodology, we interviewed experts and tested it on real PS. To do so, we are taking an Industrial Bin Picking Application (IBPA), which is a key component in many advanced manufacturing facilities. IBP is often workpiece specific and, therefore, requires engineering and commissioning effort. Our system will improve the speed and efficiency of iteration steps required to reduce interruptions in industrial PS and improve performance and productivity.}

Therefore, digital transformation represents one of the key strategies to integrate digital technology into all business areas, favouring the increase of profit, productivity, and agility of the company. This is not only a technological change but a cultural change requiring organizational, process and economic improvement. Scientific research proved that 84% of digital transformations fail or achieve targets below expectations. Consistent with this issue, companies should address the need to implement a digital process, self-evaluating the readiness level for digital transformation. In this regard, the paper aims to develop a model that evaluates the organisations’ readiness to implement digital transformation according to I4.0 targets. For this purpose, the model adopts an online survey of 38 questions to identify the readiness degree according to a five-level scale. The survey was submitted to a sample of companies operating in different sectors. The works’ results show the model’s reliability to provide the readiness level for digital transformation and allows a preliminary evaluation of the companies’ aspects most impactful on digital transformation implementation.}

Evidence is presented here of how text-mining techniques can be applied to the analysis of data on emerging skill needs arising from Industry 4.0 to ensure that ESCO provides information which is current. The alignment between ESCO and Industry 4.0 technological trends is analysed. Using text mining techniques, information is extracted on Industry 4.0 technologies from: (i) two versions of ESCO (v1.0 - v1.1.); and (ii) from the 4.0 related scientific literature. These are then compared to identify potential data gaps in ESCO. The findings demonstrate that text mining applied on scientific literature to extract technology trends, can help policy makers to provide more up-to-date labour market intelligence.}

New technologies and solutions were developed and get invented which ease farmers’ daily life, help them and their partners to gain knowledge about farming processes and environmental interrelations. This knowledge leads to better decisions and contributes to increased farm productivity, resource efficiency, and environmental health. Along with numerous advantages, some negative aspects and dependencies risk seamless workflow of agricultural production. Therefore, this study presents the state of the art of digitization in agriculture and points out vulnerabilities in digitized farming processes. The most important are the lack of interoperability and the dependency on internet connection. Hence, requirements are posed to meet these vulnerabilities in future IT (information technology) systems resulting in successive levels of resilience that cover the individual needs of farms adjusted to their mobile and landline internet supply. These findings are incorporated in a conceptual framework for a highly digitized fictive farm. Resilience is ensured by decentralized storage and computing capacities and internet independent communication networks including cooperation with machinery rings and contractors.}

At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.}

The international team (authors of this paper) worked together to analyse the status of this convergence through the assessment of concrete examples, referred to here as demonstrators, within advanced manufacturing systems. Four independent demonstrators from different sections of the manufacturing value chain and involving bio-inspiration, bio-integration and/or bio-intelligence were selected to test the following hypothesis: “That Future Manufacturing Systems will incorporate Components, Features, Characteristics and Capabilities that enable the convergence towards Living Systems”. Each of these four demonstrators have succeeded in supporting this hypothesis and in providing clear evidence to confirm that significant performance benefits may be derived through the “biologicalisation” of advanced manufacturing systems. This conclusion is of great significance for the next phases of development of manufacturing science and engineering globally. The evidence reported in this paper provides a robust basis for recommending that a deeper analysis of the implications of biologicalised manufacturing systems be undertaken. As a result of this early stage work, it is concluded that there is a high likelihood that this new convergence will lead to a major paradigm shift in advanced manufacturing. Outstanding opportunities exist for high levels of innovation in the next stages of development of advanced manufacturing processes and systems from the biological perspective. The relationship between the human and the physical manufacturing system will also change and the world of advanced manufacturing will be confronted with many new challenges including important ethical questions.}

In this work, a data-driven process optimization framework has been proposed for the additive manufacturing process, integrating machine learning, finite-element method (FEM) modeling, and cloud-edge data storage/transfer optimization. A three-level hierarchy of local machines, factory clouds, and a research center is introduced with each level responsible for its dedicated tasks. In addition, to ensure the efficiency of data transfer and storage, an edge-cloud data transfer scheme is constructed, which serves as a guideline for the data flow in the AM framework. Moreover, an overview of the connections between the proposed framework and the Industry 4.0 framework is presented.}

The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study’s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security.

We study how firms' technological, organizational, environmental, and human resource contexts impact IA implementation. The study further explains how IA may associate with the firm's triple bottom line while accounting for the moderating role of corporate social responsibility strategy. The study surveyed 207 multinational firms in 2022 and used partial least square-structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships. Results showed that IA implementation is mainly determined by the characteristics of the firm's internal environment, such as absorptive capacity, employee socio-behavioral concerns, and social capital competency. IA may offer valuable opportunities for boosting the firm's economic and environmental sustainability performance. Nonetheless, IA is a double-edged sword for social sustainability, harming social values in implementing firms with informal corporate social sustainability strategies. Conversely, firms with formal corporate social sustainability strategy have a significantly higher opportunity to transform the value of IA into social sustainability performance. Findings are expected to assist managers and decision-makers with streamlining an impartial and sustainable transition of organizations toward automation.}

Also, the challenges involved in implementing I4.0 with AM as one of the key technologies are presented. AM being digital manufacturing technology, details are presented on how AM is making use of other components of I4.0, namely IIOT, sensors, big data, artificial intelligence, machine leaning, and cloud computing. This chapter provides a basic understanding of the role played by these components at various stages, from design to manufacturing. The sustainability aspects of AM as apart of I4.0 are covered. Benefits that can be derived with AM in I4.0 are dealt with in this chapter.}

abstract = {This paper conducts a review of the literature to identify associations in operations between Industry 4.0 capabilities such as Additive Manufacturing, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Robots, Big Data, Cloud Computing, IIoT, Simulation, and Systems Integration with the commonly identified lean manufacturing wastes of Transport, Inventory, Movement, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects, and Underutilized skills. The paper documents research that links various capabilities and wastes, including how IIoT can be used to reduce defects in manufacturing, and how it can mitigate overproduction across industries. There is also evidence that big data implementation in manufacturing has positive effects on reducing waiting times across the manufacturing process and delivery, and that cloud computing technologies guarantee better estimates for product and predicted inventory amounts. The research finds impacts on the social aspect of manufacturing by how augmented reality tools are increasingly used in the manufacturing sector to improve workers’ knowledge, skills, and abilities, and that simulation software applications are capable of decreasing operator motion wastes. The paper concludes that there is a clear benefit for SMEs in using Industry 4.0 in lean implementation journeys, and it supports the efforts of manufacturing organizations to become leaner using Industry 4.0 capabilities and solutions.}

The value of the VSM has greatly expanded from conventional to smart over time; hence, researchers and practitioners in this sector are paying more emphasis. Comprehensive review research is needed to understand VSM-based smart, sustainable development from a triple-bottom-line perspective. The primary goal of this research is to look at various insights from the historical literature that can help with the adoption of smart, sustainable development through VSM. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) with a fifteen-year time range (2008–2022) is being considered to study various insights and gaps in value stream mapping. Analysis of the significant outcomes presents an eight-point study agenda: year, national context, research method, sector, wastes, VSM type, applied tools, and analysis indicators. The critical finding implies that empirical qualitative research dominates the research sector. Effective VSM implementation requires balancing the three sustainable dimensions of economic, environmental, and social through digitalization. The circular economy should also bolster research on the intersection of sustainability applications and new digital paradigms such as industry revolution 4.0.}

Despite the common interest in drones for commercial deliveries, the use of this disruptive technology can be examined in the contexts of other world strategic demands such as climate change issues and traffic management. As of very recently, some drone-related futuristic disruptive technologies, including quantum drones (QD), the Internet of Quantum Drones (IoQDs), and a constellation of quantum satellites (CQS), are expected to be a breakthrough technology in strategic areas of society. However, prior research has not adequately examined and explored the potential applications of these drone-related futuristic disruptive technologies for social concern. Therefore, this study investigates how QD, IoQDs, and CQS can be applied in new contexts in real-time applications in strategic areas of societal interest, especially during the quantum age. Overall, our results unveil new potential and advanced applications to drone-related disruptive technologies in recognized and new contexts. Two relevant implications are highlighted. First, this research inaugurates new contexts regarding the use of drone-related technologies enabled by the Internet in themes of economic and social concerns. Second, from a futuristic point of view, the study examines the main challenges, risks, and advantages of the practical use of these technologies. We conclude this research with a summary of the main gaps and scientific challenges to the field and propose opportunities for future research.}

Enabling I4.0 technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing, can be implemented through various combinations to achieve different impacts on a company's performance. But what are the possible ways of combining I4.0 technologies into bundles, and do these ways actually help to achieve a performance that outperforms the adoption of single technologies? This study aims to identify the potential patterns of the technological complementary of I4.0 by considering enabled applications and performance outcomes. We interviewed 13 Italian experts in the I4.0 field, and then combined the obtained information with secondary data collected from more than 150 I4.0 use cases, as well as from websites, reports and press releases. By adopting a systems theory lens, the results of the analysis have allowed us to identify the specific performance effects of both scattered and joint technological adoptions in different application areas. Interestingly, specific examples of I4.0 complementarities emerged, namely full, hybrid and platform complementarity. This study contributes to the growing research on I4.0 outcomes by extending the concept of technological complementary within the I4.0 context. Results show that bundles of technologies have a broader effect on performance than when the same technologies are adopted in isolation, but also that single technologies can impact specific applications and the overall performance of a firm via a systematic I4.0 transformation path.}

A good effect of this is the significant productivity enhancement in all its aspects such as reduction of raw material consumption and of production times. But production systems are made of an interaction between human and machines, as the recent literature on Industry 5.0 recalled, trying to reset the role of human actor in the collaboration process in manufacturing. The basic idea is that embracing the Industry 5.0 paradigm, the intelligent cooperation of human operator with properly designed machines may allow an higher efficiency and precision in manufacturing processes based on I4.0. This paper, starting from a widespread review of all the available assessment models about sustainability and smartness (now turning into “digitainability”), encompassing also maturity models and standards formally proposes a metamodel to support assessment model design and implementation. The metamodel allows to set all the necessary dimensions required for a comprehensive view of any manufacturing reality aimed to move toward a Industry 5.0 paradigm.}

However, a defossilized energy system is vastly more complex than current fossil-based energy systems: The integration of distributed energy resources and sector-coupling increases connectivity, demands interdisciplinary workflows, and creates a need for more sophisticated design processes. Inspired by the semiconductor and automotive industries, digitalization of the design process using platform-based design (PBD), coupled with the energy hub concept, can improve cost-effective energy systems design and accelerate the industry’s contributions to achieving net-zero emissions. PBD is an efficient and effective methodology to manage and de-risk the complexity of integrated energy system design, leading to affordable and reliable solutions due to the inherent techno-economic analysis underlying the decision-making process. Combining the PBD framework with the energy hub concepts establishes a powerful design workflow for developing holistic energy systems from a single building up to the district and city scales. The fundamental tenets of this workflow, as discussed in this paper, are (1) the separation of functions from architectures, (2) the identification of abstraction levels at which systems can be analyzed and optimized, and (3) the ability to repurpose components at all levels of abstraction to aid design reuse and allow performance feedback at every stage of the process. We argue that PBD can become the next frontier in energy system design. PBD, as presented in this paper, is not limited to the energy sector, and it can also be a sub-process of an even more holistic infrastructure design. Spatial planning, architecture, and civil engineering can all be further integrated with the PBD concept, allowing societies to reach ambitious sustainability goals faster, at lower cost, and with greater resilience.}

In recent times, the Ethereum network has emerged as a popular blockchain framework for providing provenance and traceability of proprietary manufacturing data in decentralized CMaaS. However, the Ethereum ecosystem was only designed to store and transmit low volume financial transaction data and little has been done to make it an efficient repository of large manufacturing data streams in CMaaS systems. In this paper, the authors build on their previous work and report the design, implementation, and validation of middleware software architectures that allow Ethereum based distributed CMaaS platforms to harness the benefits of the secure asset models of the Ethereum ecosystem and the immutable big data storage capabilities of the decentralized BigchainDB database platform. A novel hybrid blockchain architecture enabled by efficient communication protocols and blockchain oracles is proposed. This architecture allows the transfer and immutable storage of large manufacturing data streams onto global BigchainDB nodes allowing data rich manufacturing transactions to bypass the transaction fees of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, a machine learning based time series inference model is proposed which enables the forecast of Ethereum gas price into the future. This allows the CMaaS platform smart contracts to judiciously assign gas price limits and hence save on transactions ensuing from transfer or creation of assets. The outcomes of this research show that the designed hybrid architecture can lead to the reduction of significant number of computational steps and hence transaction fees on Ethereum by offloading large volume data onto BigchainDB nodes. A Random Forest regressor based time series inference model has been shown to exhibit superior performance in the prediction of Ethereum gas price, that allows the CMaaS to avoid executing transactions in periods of high gas prices within the Ethereum ecosystem.}

abstract = {Digitalisation has developed over half a century and is one of the global trends defining society of today and future. Digitalisation is envisioned to help water utilities to become: i) community orientated and digitally integrated with customers and society; ii) digitally transformed end-to-end throughout the value-chain and interconnected between business units; iii) predictive & proactive, utilizing models and applications for control and decision support; iv) visually communicative with customers and society, creating customers aware of the value of water; and financially sustainable by optimal operation (OPEX), and sustainable investments (CAPEX). Digitalisation is a process for business development, where digital solutions are used for automation and innovation. Utilizing the potential of the technological innovation requires a parallel organisational transformation. Any implementation of systems or applications must be motivated in actual needs for the organisation and service delivery. Prior to any digitalisation, identifying issues and areas of improvement is essential. Starting the digital journey, motivating employees, improving the digital culture and creating acceptance of new processes are needed on all levels. Most digital applications require collection, storage, sharing and integrated analysis of large amounts of data. This includes both soft and hard digital infrastructure.}

abstract = {The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

Since its initial German conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the Industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms − such as “smart manufacturing”, “digital transformation”, and “fourth industrial revolution” − have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts. The review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. Each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. This categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets.}

The latter are critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and could either lead to their future success or jeopardize their economic survival. To scrutinize the impact of an I4.0 solution on their processes, SMEs need to assess their trans formed processes holistically with respect to numerous perspectives. Existing assessment approaches either focus on a single I4.0 solution in isolation, assess exclusively from the technological perspective, or lack an overall procedural and economic impact evaluation. The aim of this contribution is to develop a framework of performance metrics for the holistic impact evaluation of I4.0 solutions on SMEs. In the framework, we consolidate the impacts of technology applications discussed in the literature into 16 main fields of action and define adequate performance metrics to assess each of them. The resulting performance framework combines traditional metrics for the evaluation of supply chain processes i.e., supply chain operations reference-metrics and the global reporting initiative, and extends them with additional performance metrics relevant to the assessment of I4.0 solutions. This framework aims to facilitate and systemize the selection of adequate attributes for the evaluation of I4.0 solutions. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the practical utility of the framework and its convenience for the purpose of an assessment.}

The proposed innovative scheme can ease travel, ensure free movement, and minimize economic damages. However, protecting personal and digital health passport information during a crisis is challenging. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an agent-based secure decentralized innovative digital health passport protocol that is interoperable, fault-tolerant, and compatible with privacy standards. The proposed solution is known as Secure Mobile Digital Passport Agent (SMDPA), uses: (1) Private Set Intersection (PSI) to (a) protect Digital Health Passport Information (DHPA) against surveillance, especially during the crisis, (b) generate Bit Passing Coin (BPC); (2) blockchain to store serialized SMDPAs copies (3) mobile agent to disseminate DHPA autonomously; (4) Location and time attributes for data minimization. We prototype the proposed solution using the JADE agent framework. The performance measurements show that the result is acceptable.}

abstract = {The safety requirements are often described via specifications called contracts. To verify that the system fulfils certain safety requirements, for instance, in the assume-guarantee contract specification, the key safety indicators are organized, so that if certain assumptions hold then the respective behaviour is guaranteed. Safety contracts provide a means of exposing potential incompatibilities early in the development process, selecting components to reuse, certifying systems, and identifying uncertainty sources during the operational phase. There exist several studies on contract-based safety assurance, however, there is not any systematic study in this field. For this, a first Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is carried out to obtain an overview of the various contract-based safety assurance concepts, problems, proposed solutions, and their usefulness. In our study, the identification and selection of the primary studies were based on a well-planned search strategy. The search process identified a total of 2881 studies published between 1969 and 2021, out of which 66 studies were selected through a multi-stage process according to our predefined SLR protocol. This SLR aims to highlight the state-of-the-art of contract-based safety assurance and identify potential gaps for future research. Based on research topics in selected studies, we identified the following main categories: contract type, analysis techniques for system safety, compliance with standards, development stage, domain, level of automation, type of study and evaluation, and tool support. The findings of the systematic review not only highlight that the contracts are even more important for advanced safety-critical systems but also strategies to exploit their full potential should be considered in future studies. The suggestions revealed for future research include the usage of contracts for adapting new behaviour, defining system boundaries, interacting with other systems, managing risk during operation, dynamic/runtime safety assurance, and integration of safety with security.}

In this paper we extend the use of Wikipedia by comparing the German edition with the world largest edition (in English) in order to examine whether there are significant structural differences. We first validate the use of Wikipedia for emerging technologies and for cross-language comparisons as a tool for (almost) real time strategic analysis. We then extract all Wikipedia pages related to Industry 4.0, build up a knowledge network and study its topological properties in the two editions. We find striking differences, which can be explained with respect to the persistence of the industrial pattern of specialization of Germany with respect to all other countries. Emerging technologies introduce novelty but also preserve path-dependency in the pattern of specialization. The implications for companies and policy makers are discussed.}

To increase their overall resilience against such unexpected disruptions, traditional approaches are no longer sufficient. To date, research on supply chain resilience has mainly focused on reactive responses and recovery strategies (post-disruption). Hence, the research gap addressed in this paper is that of identifying new and proactive strategies to enable pre-emptive resilience in military supply chains (pre-disruption). In this paper, the authors first provide a critical review of the pertinent literature and research conducted over the past 12 years. Following on from there, they identify new research directions for enabling pre-emptive resilience to aid military logistic planners in monitoring supply chains and strategic decision-making to maintain their resilience.}

More specifically, research has overlooked how such provider capabilities address the adopter's requirements and facilitate the related innovation outcomes for the adopter firm. Thus, our findings provide several contributions to the literature. Firstly, by examining two smart manufacturing projects within Pharmaceutical and Semi-conductor manufacturing contexts, we provide an in-depth analysis of the complexity of adopter requirements. Secondly, we uncover the nature of three main technology provider dynamic ecosystem capabilities. These reflect comprehensive skills in technology search and learning, project implementation, and knowledge transfer capabilities supporting the development of solutions for decision-making and predictive maintenance. Thirdly, we reveal how provider ecosystems build on these capabilities to address the complex requirements of the adopter firm and facilitate different types of process innovation outcomes.

The study results revealed that users preferred digital forest recreation to experience outdoor adventure and a nature-based digital twin in the metaverse, indicating that digital forest recreation has the potential to influence human-nature interactions. The students required responsible and immersive metaverse platforms for digital forest recreation that were not subject to invasions of user privacy (e.g., selling big data of users), biased algorithms (e.g., racism), algorithms selling virtual goods, cyberaggression (e.g., trolling), and less immersive virtual experiences.

Although, this is an area of increased interest, the information concerning the implementation of data analytics in the context of Industry4.0 is scarcely available in scientific literature. Therefore, this work presents a process data analytics platform built around the concept of industry 4.0. The platform utilizes the state-of-the-art IIoT platforms, ML algorithms and big-data software tools. The platform emphasizes the use of ML methods for process data analytics while leveraging big-data processing tools and taking advantage of the currently available industrial grade cloud computing platforms. The industrial applicability of the platform was demonstrated by the development of soft sensors for use in a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. In the case study, the work studied data-driven soft sensors to predict syngas heating value and hot flue gas temperature. Among the studied data-driven methods, the neural network-based NARX model demonstrated better performance in the prediction of both syngas heating value and flue gas temperature. The modeling results showed that, in cases where process knowledge about the process phenomena at hand is limited, data-driven soft sensors are useful tools for predictive data analytics.}

To minimize adverse environmental impacts, industrial waste can be effectively managed through implementingsmart technologies. The present study aimed to identify the challenges of industrial waste management and propose smart solutions to effectively manage these challenges. The findings derived from a systematic literature review indicate that the challenges of industrial waste management can be classified into five dimensions within the STEEGO model. By evaluating the weights of each dimension using the HF-BWM method, the “organizational” dimension, with a weight of 0.27, was found to be the severest challenge, while the “technological” dimension, with a weight of 0.347, was considered to be the most probable challenge. Furthermore, the findings from conceptual modeling, using the TISM method, show that the primary challenges in industrial waste management include: “a lack of culture for effective waste management”, “insufficient training on legal waste drainage and proper waste digestion”, and “a lack of specific technical instructions for refining and recycling." To overcome these challenges, smart solutions have been proposed. The result of the HF-QFD method indicate that the most important solution is “constructing smart infrastructure for proper waste management”, with a score of 0.27. The novelty of this study lies in the theoretical development of the model for the challenges of industrial waste management by applying the “organizational” dimension, considering both biological and physical aspects in the “environmental” dimension, identifying smart solutions to overcome the challenges for cleaner industrial waste systems, as well as using smart industrial waste management technologies in different industries. Our results emphasize that, given the type of waste, industry managers should employ specific smart technologies for disposing and recycling industrial waste. This approach can prevent the loss of raw materials and protect the environment from various types of waste.}

abstract = {The development of dynamic data-based Decision Support Systems (DSSs) along with the increasing availability of data in the industry, makes real-time data acquisition and management a challenge. Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios. This is achieved by providing the middleware interoperability, determinism, and automatic data structuring over an industrial communication infrastructure such as the OPC UA Standard over Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). Cloud services and database warehousing used to address some of the challenges are handled using fog computing and a multi-workload database. This paper presents an implementation of the platform in the pharmaceutical industry, providing interoperability and real-time reaction capability to changes to an industrial prototype using dynamic scheduling algorithms.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) plays an important role in digital era due to its applicability in a wide range of applications such as military, smart city, healthcare, etc. Since the nodes in WSN experience power constraints and function via wireless connections, network survivability becomes a major design issue. Energy efficiency and secure data transmission are the most important solutions to be accomplished to enhance WSN survivability. The recent phenomena like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and metaheuristics can be involved in designing effective routing protocols. With this motivation, the current research paper presents a novel Trust Aware Oppositional Sine Cosine-based Multihop Routing (TAOSC-MHR) protocol to improve the survivability of WSNs. The major goal of the proposed TAOSC-MHR protocol is to increase the network's survivability by assuring trust and energy efficiency. Primarily, a weighted clustering scheme is applied to partition the network into clusters after which the Cluster Heads (CHs) are selected. Besides, TAOSC-MHR protocol involves an optimal route selection technique i.e., Oppositional Based Learning (OBL) concept with Sine Cosine Optimization (SCO) algorithm. In order to derive the optimal routes in WSN, the proposed TAOSC-MHR protocol derives an objective function with the inclusion of three parameters namely, residual energy, distance, and trust level of nodes. The design of trust aware routing protocol using OBL with SCO algorithm demonstrates the novelty of the study. A wide range of simulation analyses was conducted under different network scenarios and the obtained results signify the promising performance of the proposed technique over other techniques.}

abstract = {Modern technologies and data-driven approaches have enabled fault-tolerant controllers in Industry 4.0 smart factories to detect, identify, and mitigate anomalies in real-time with a high level of accuracy. However, this has also presented new challenges and requirements for cybersecurity, data analytics, and computational complexity for Data-Driven Fault-Tolerant Controllers (DD-FTC) in smart factories. To address these issues, a Blockchain-Based Data-Driven Fault-Tolerant Control (BB-DD-FTC) framework for smart factories is proposed in this paper. Blockchain ensures the integrity of data logs via its immutable ledger and decentralized architecture. Moreover, the blockchain smart contract functionality, embedded with a Data-Driven Intrusion Detection System (DD-IDS), and reconfiguration conditions, realizes DD-FTC and undertakes the mitigation response in case of cyber-attacks. The DD-IDS mechanism utilizes the principal component analysis technique and observer models, trained via neural networks, to detect an attack and identify the compromised component. The Tennessee Eastman (TE) industrial benchmark process is considered a case study to investigate the performance of the proposed framework. Two kinds of integrity attacks are applied to the sensors of the TE process with simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in mitigating the adversarial effect of the applied attacks on the overall system performance. As feedback delays can negatively impact performance, a detailed delay analysis is performed using network calculus. The security advantages and limitations of the proposed method are finally highlighted in the performed security analysis. The results are encouraging for the wider adoption of the control-over-the-blockchain concept.}

It may be seen as a manifestation of technological progression which has been traditionally given a strong emphasis in theories of economic growth. The roots of digitalization are thus old, but the terminology has experienced rapid growth during the last decades. This paper focuses on the future prospects of digitalization in Finnish ports operating international trade and transports. In the case of transport, logistics, and ports the public sector has, mainly through ministries and offices focusing on economic development and employment, initiated numerous development programs with foresight ambitions. Commonly, these programs have a mid-range target setting referring to a 5–10-years time span into the future. The primary data is collected from two workshops (group interviews). As a result, the research identifies the main drivers and technologies that are significant for port digitalization. These are discussed in the context of three alternative scenarios: Digital supremacy; business as usual; and digital failure. These three scenarios are classified with SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities; Threats) and PESTEL (Political; Economic; Social; Technological; Environmental; Legal) frameworks. It is assumed that the actualized future development will follow the mid-sections of the scenarios depending on global trends in politics and trade that impact the supply and demand that underlie the need for transport.}

The MoE includes Web 3.0 components, generated data, virtual individuals called Metaversians, and all virtual things in Metaverse, forming a comprehensive network of interconnected entities. Our research suggests that Metaverse will become increasingly popular, with the virtual world incorporating more aspects of the physical world. We have conducted a SWOT (Strengths - Weaknesses - Opportunities - Threats) analysis of the MoE concept and have identified several opportunities and challenges. Finally, we propose potential future directions for MoE that academic researchers, industry owners, and IT leaders can pursue. In particular, we suggest the implementation of a new service called Metaverse-as-a-creator (MaaC) based on an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Metaverse as a significant achievement in future Internet-based communication.}
