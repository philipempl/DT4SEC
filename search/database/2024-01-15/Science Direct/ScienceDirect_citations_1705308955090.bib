abstract = {Blockchain technology is used adeptly to simplify the complex and fragmented processes present in the transportation system like mobility-as-a-service and supply chain management. Companies across the trucking industry have integrated blockchain in transportation and mobility service. A blockchain is a distributed, digital ledger that records transactions in a series of blocks. It exists in multiple copies spread over multiple computers, and track all the records of the system. It records transactions, tracks assets, and creates a transparent and efficient system to manage all documents involved in the transportation system. In this chapter, we have described the role of blockchain in the transportation system in terms of mobility-as-a-service and supply chain management.}

The three organisations expect AI to contribute to sustainability and a prosperous future with better data analysis, greater amounts of quantitative knowledge, and by making economic and social activities less wasteful and more energy efficient. Several challenges are also named: ethics, human rights, cybersecurity, access to reliable data, transparency, and the digital gap. The solutions presented are multi-stakeholder collaboration, cohesive but flexible governance frameworks, but also taking the lead to push for ethical and value-based AI and making sure AI is sustainable. Ideas about AI appear to stem from discourses of ecological modernisation and green governmentality. This framing turns political and structural challenges into technical issues to be solved with more data, greater collaboration, and technical progress. The similarities in ideas between the EU, the UN, and the World Economic Forum also suggest that ideas about AI and sustainable development have reached discourse institutionalisation. Ideas about AI are therefore likely to reinforce already existing institutional and discursive settings.}

The subject was examined from policies, technology and market perspectives. Numerous European regulations and policies are driving the twin transition since many of them include obligatory requirements for the member states. Technologies and technology combinations exist to support the twin transition in the Nordic built environment. It was assessed that energy technologies are the most important and control, monitoring and automation technologies are the second most important technology category for the twin transition. In addition, individual technologies’ maturity and relevance to the twin transition in the built environment in cold climates were evaluated. By analyzing case studies, it was found that the markets are not mature enough to lead the twin transition, but external boosts are needed. However, this can also be seen as an opportunity for service business. The results are focused on Northern Europe, but European legislation also supports the international SDGs.}

GovTech refers to socio-technical solutions – that are developed and operated by private organisations – intertwined with public sector components for facilitating processes in the public sector. GovTech solutions promise a superior customer journey for citizens and businesses compared to current government portals and front desks. GovTech solutions can be a blessing in disguise for governments struggling in their digital transformation journey, carrying the burden of public service innovation and replacing legacy systems with modern GovTech solutions. Yet, there are also concerns that GovTech solutions are a Trojan horse, exploiting the lack of technical knowledge at public agencies and shifting decision-making power from public agencies to market parties, thereby undermining digital sovereignty and public values. This paper develops a research agenda for GovTech based on a conceptual framework. This framework reveals four interrelated design areas for GovTech: institutional, governance, technical and human-centred design. Governments can employ the conceptual framework to further align and develop their strategies by focussing on GovTech governance, referring to the ability to manage the various interdependencies between the four design areas.}

The present study strived to address this knowledge gap by developing a strategic roadmap that outlines how Industry 5.0 can boost sustainable manufacturing. The study first conducted a content-centric literature review and identified 12 functions through which Industry 5.0 can inclusively boost sustainable manufacturing. The study further developed a strategic roadmap that identified the complex contextual relationships among the functions and explained how they should be synergistically leveraged to maximize their contribution to sustainability. Results reveal that value network integration, sustainable technology governance, sustainable business model innovation, and sustainable skill development are the most driver and tangible implications of Industry 5.0 for sustainable manufacturing. Alternatively, renewable integration and manufacturing resilience are among the most dependent and hard-to-reach sustainable functions of Industry 5.0, and their materialization requires major strategic collaboration among stakeholders. The strategic roadmap outlines how Industry 5.0 stakeholders can leverage the technological and functional constituents of this agenda to promote sustainable manufacturing inclusively.}

How the most relevant technologies and Information Systems are used by the Port Communities for their businesses is discussed together with a detailed analysis of the on-going actions carried on by Standard Setting Organizations. Considering the examples given by the C-ITS Platform and the C-Roads programme at EU level, a proposal of contents to be considered in a comprehensive standardization action is given. The innovation services are therefore grouped into four bundles: (i) Vessel & Marine Navigation, (ii) e-Freight & (Intermodal) Logistics, (iii) Passenger Transport, (iv) Environmental sustainability. The standardized version of these applications will be finally labeled as C-Port services. Alongside the standardization plan, a proposal for ranking the ports on the basis of a specially-defined C-Port vector is discussed with the purpose of addressing the well-known lack of consensus around the mathematical definition of the Smart Port Index. Considering the good practice and the background offered by the Port of Livorno in terms of innovation actions, the prospected final user applications are then labeled as Day 1, Day 1.5, and Day 2 services in consideration of the technical and commercial gaps to be filled. As a case study about the evolution in the C-Port vector experienced by the Port of Livorno in the last years will also be discussed.}

Beginning in the past with games, it becomes increasingly integrated into human life as time passes. Metaverse usage is inevitable in every aspect of life. One of its potential application areas could be urban transportation. A novel fuzzy trigonometric based on the combination of the Full Consistency Method (FUCOM) and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) is proposed to rank three alternatives with twelve criteria under four major aspects: managerial, safety, user, and urban mobility. In the first stage, fuzzy FUCOM methods are used to calculate the weights of the criteria. In the second stage, the fuzzy trigonometric based CoCoSo method is applied to evaluate and rank the alternatives. The proposed model enables the nonlinear processing of complex and uncertain information using fuzzy trigonometric functions. The findings demonstrate focusing on a particular age group can make it easier to integrate the metaverse with urban transportation. The findings of this study have the potential to serve as a guide for decision-makers. The metaverse-based applications could be started by policymakers, which is a promising opportunity with potential boundaries beyond human comprehension making this statement weaker.}

The issuing regulatory entity, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces the regulations for Process Safety Management (PSM) of facilities handling highly hazardous chemicals. This management system contains 14 elements that are to be incorporated over a covered facility's lifecycle. Other countries followed with similar management system requirements for process safety. Digitalization of the process industry is evident in nearly every system of chemical manufacturing. Digital controls and data communications as applied to processing plants continue to grow in capability as well as complexity. Advances in digital technologies have also affected the way PSM systems are applied to these facilities. While digitalization used in the PSM elements offers significant advantages with respect to effectiveness and efficiency, there are also disadvantages. These will be described for some of the elements in this chapter, along with a few practical applications. At the chapter's end, a few recent journal articles that have been briefly reviewed are summarized. These articles discuss future advanced safety management aspects, e.g., emphasizing the importance of digital twin technique for safe human-machine interaction, and how digitalization will support improvements in process safety by means of many different mechanisms.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is characterized by increased flexibility of production processes, a level of customization, a level of automation, smart manufacturing execution, and overall optimized production processes. Despite global competition, flexibility is a differentiation strategy applied by manufacturers to remain competitive. By incorporating flexibility in the manufacturing process of their products, enterprises can adapt faster to the demands. Enterprises need cost-effective, intuitive solutions to benefit from Industry 4.0 involving minimal efforts and integration costs. This study presents a new approach increasing the flexibility of manufacturing operations including robot trajectory, processing, and quality control. The results are tested in an industrial platform 4.0 installed in the laboratory. Our approach is to transform a rigid production system into an agile production system. For this, we break down the manufacturing process and reorganize it by programming core modules while maintaining the existing control structure but upgrading its programmable function to the Manufacturing Execution System Layer. Thus, the production manager can use the developed modules connected by flows to orchestrate a new production plan in a short time compared with the traditional approach.}

We present VOneGANs, a novel class of generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the qualitatively updated discriminative component. The new model incorporates a biologically constrained digital primary visual cortex V1. This earliest cortical visual area performs the first stage of human‘s visual processing and is believed to be a reason of its robustness and accuracy. Experiments with the updated architectures confirm the improved stability of GANs training and the higher quality of the automatically generated visual content. The promising results allow considering VOneGANs as providers of high-quality training content and as enablers of future simulation-based decision-making and decision-support tools for condition-monitoring, supervisory control, diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and cybersecurity in Industry 4.0.}

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged and forced out the ephemeral conventional approaches. Thus, the post-COVID world indicates the need for sustainable development and strategies in par with the ecosystem. The authors propose this study as a guide to direct the post-pandemic scenario into the sustainable pathway by prioritizing energy sustainability to engage the actions for achieving the SDGs. The analysis in this study commences with the investigation of pronounced impacts in the energy sector with its influence on the progress towards sustainability. To pursue the path of energy sustainability, a qualitative analysis is performed in a parallel approach from the key viewpoint of the renewable and sustainable energy transition, digital transformation of the energy sector and energy affordability in the post-COVID world. A SWOT-AHP hybrid methodology is employed to identify the significance of each strategy or issues to be focused on immediately in the post-COVID world. The study also discusses energy sustainability from political bodies and policy makers’ perspective, and the actual scenario where we are headed is revealed with the aid of process-tracing method. Furthermore, a novel quantitative analysis is established to represent the SDG’s interaction and the result shows that the SDG 7 is the underpinning goal in relative to other SDGs. In context with it, the mapping of energy sustainability to the sustainable world is accomplished. The ultimate inference from envisioning the SDGs through energy sustainability shows that a sustainable world would result after the pandemic. However, the changes in the energy market, investment preferences and more importantly, the decisions influenced by the political bodies in the post-COVID-world is decisive in achieving the same in a stipulated time frame.}

Based on a socio-technical perspective, this paper presents a multi- and inter-disciplinary framework to identify and evaluate the competencies necessary for leading digital innovation in the built environment. The framework incorporates three dimensions: digital and technical, governance and management, and ethical and responsible innovation. A review of existing competency frameworks for digitalisation in the urban built environment is presented to identify competency gaps across the three dimensions. The results show that existing frameworks rarely strive for comprehensiveness and are limited in their scope to certain competencies along a single dimension. In addition, studies addressing the need for multi- and inter-disciplinary competencies across the three dimensions are lacking. The paper thus demonstrates that our three-pronged framework is a useful and much needed tool to identify competency requirements for local public, private and community stakeholders to steer place-based digital innovation and ensure public value creation.}

This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience.

Digital platforms can support the twin transition to digitalization and sustainability, converting the abstract into the tangible (i.e., data flows, information, and knowledge), and providing an industrial testbed to collaborate and challenge the willingness to share data, co-create and deliver value through sustainability-oriented digital services. This study presents a research collaboration with industrial actors in the context of Swedish manufacturing, aiming to showcase the potential of platforms in Swedish value chains. Awareness of the digital maturity as-is status from the individual actors within a value chain, and purposeful development strategies can lead to improved digital performance, an increased sense of collaboration and sustainable behaviour. Through a case study approach, this article illustrates the potential of digital platforms by presenting three manufacturing value chains where prioritised industrial challenges are addressed through the capabilities of such platforms: (1) a CO2 visualisation platform that allows transparency, communication and data-sharing between the stakeholders of the value chain and aims to connect different industrial partners and aims to reduce sustainability impact through collaborative efforts; (2) a collaborative root-cause analysis digital platform that allows virtual commissioning of sustainability experts, and technical support; (3) the re-development of a productivity-centred digital service into a sustainability-informing solution that provides relevant production data for SMEs, who are customers of the machine tool sector. The preliminary findings include: (1) digital maturity of individual firms in a value chain impacts the feasibility of platform development, (2) increased digital maturity allows companies to shift their focus towards sustainability priorities; most companies are often too concerned with productivity, visibility, and flexibility challenges, leaving the sustainability imperative as a nice-to-have, (3) the lack of focus on sustainability can be caused by unclear understanding of how consumer-perceived value can be captured.}

Critical findings are summarized for each part, i.e., the advances and trends in physical energy generation, transmission, consumption, and storage processes of cities for energy interventions, the cyber process chain of energy sensing, modeling, forecasting, scheduling, coordinating, and adapting for enhancing the “smartness” of power and urban energy systems, and the social energy processes of understanding, protecting, engaging, and governing human to be a new smartness dimension. Second, the process-based framework provides insights on the design and implementation of SG and SUES for engineers, planners, and policymakers, such as optimizing the system performance by upgrading individual processes and exploring new links among identified physical, cyber, and social energy processes. The upscaling barriers and strategies of sustainable energy technologies in the development and deployment stages are also summarized to scale up sustainable energy processes to a higher level. Finally, future research directions are envisioned, including developing data markets, privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics for urban-scale energy modeling, refining policy and standards for safety, privacy, cybersecurity, and interoperability issues, assessing technology maturity and energy system success factors, and removing regulatory and structural barriers.}

In this paper, we analyse the implementation paths for digital transformation adopted by a wide sample of Italian SMEs operating in different sectors. By combining Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling with Necessity Condition Analysis, we clarify the specific enabler and enhancer roles played by different digital technologies. The study sheds further light on the relationship among these technologies and their contribution to the development of SMEs’ information processing capability. In particular, our analysis shows that digital technologies associated with Industry 4.0 can be classified into four hierarchical layers, Sensor, Integration, Intelligence, and Response, that are in charge of the collection, combination, processing and use of organizational data. Our results show that the implementation of these layers is not based on a standalone approach since the lower layers enable and enhance the adoption of the upper layers. The present paper may also offer useful insights to managers and policymakers, interested in improving the digital transformation of SMEs.}

abstract = {With the growth of the industrial age, the need for energy is continuously increasing. To provide efficient power distribution, instill minimal losses, ensure high quality, and dependable supply security, the smart grid idea has cropped up in conversations that allows for the generation and sale of power on a small, individual scale. However, the strategy enhances existing system issues, such as how are transactions among both producers and users carried out, validated, and documented. For a start, smart grids use smart contracts to conduct transactions, with the network serving as a transaction verifier. The advantages of smart grids over traditional power distribution systems rest in its innovative offerings to customers who until then, for many years, had few options for choosing between generated energy, most of which are based on fossil fuels. Not only was the equipment used to create energy highly costly, making it unsuitable for small-scale applications or personal usage of the users but also customers who generated their own electricity had it distributed by the power grid and only paid for what they used. However, technological advancements have altered how humans create and distribute power. Automation results in mass manufacturing, which results in less expensive power generators. Inventions enabled energy to be generated from solar power, tidal waves, geothermal power, and other non-conventional sources. This created the opportunity for an area, household, or a single person to produce their own electricity. Whenever a person created more energy than they had use for, they could easily sell the extra electricity to others, therefore acting as alternative energy sources. In terms of power supply, the smart grid provides greater assurance. However, the idea of automating an electric grid complicates the already complex electrical system. On a transactional level, how can we ensure that generators supply electricity after the user has paid. Because the network has so many producers and consumers, it causes issues about who can truly authenticate the transaction and how the process will operate. Traditional energy trading strategies focus on a centralized approach or third-party companies, but that might be vulnerable from single-point failure. As a result, a secure and reliable trading strategy must be installed in the system to ensure the data security of customers. In this regard, a new technology known as a blockchain, which is a chain of decentralized and distributed transaction ledgers that each user retains and maintains, can address the issue outlined above. Many of the issues that inhibit the Energy Internet’s growth can be solved by applying the blockchain’s technical benefits to it. The use of blockchain technology in the energy sector is only getting started, but it has a lot of room for growth in the future. Enhanced security, better data protection, data transparency and integrity, elimination of third-party authority and trust, pervasive solutions, and higher data usability are just a few of the advantages. Restricted adaptability and speed, off-chain service demands, expensive building and maintenance costs, and the need for more experimental studies are among the still thorny issues.}

However, model and data security may pose challenges for developing zero-defect production and other industrial manufacturing industries. To address this issue, we generate adversarial examples using a one-pixel attack in adversarial machine learning, which can fool the defect detection classification model. The traditional one-pixel attack based on the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm has limited global search ability. Therefore, we use a novel algorithm called Teaching and Learning-based Moth-Flame Optimization (TLMFO), which enhances the global search performance and improves the attack effectiveness. We evaluate TLMFO on benchmark functions and attacks on Cifar10 and ImageNet datasets, and compare it with MFO and DE. The results show that TLMFO outperforms both MFO and DE in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence. Moreover, TLMFO achieves notably better attack effectiveness than DE under targeted and untargeted attacks on the Cifar10 dataset and under-targeted attacks on the ImageNet dataset. Our research confirms that safety prevention is a link worth considering in developing Industry 5.0.}

With the development of smart cities, there needs to be a better understanding of how the introduction of smart technologies will affect urban resilience. To address this issue, this article presents a critical review of the literature on smart cities and smart technologies focussing on representations of resilience. The findings reveal that discussing resilience in relation to smart city components of the data layer, digital technologies and the physical city can provide some degree of clarity despite the existence of a multiplicity of definitions and interpretations. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the nature of relationships between ‘smartness’ and ‘resilience’ remains contested, and largely dependent on the perceived role of digital technologies in resilience-building processes. This in turn is influenced by how these technologies are used and what the intention and expectations are in relation to their use. In order to address these issues, we conclude that further interdisciplinary research, extending to the physical, social and environmental systems of cities, is needed to better understand the relations between smartness and resilience.}

Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.}

From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.}

The other dominant and prominent aspects include polyglot microservices are solidifying deeply as the new building and deployment/execution block in the software world toward the much-needed accelerated software design, development, deployment, and delivery. The device ecosystem expands frenetically with the arrival of trendy and handy, slim and sleek, disappearing and disposable gadgets, gizmos thereby ubiquitous (anywhere, anytime, and any device) access, and usage of web-scale information, content, and services get fructified. Finally, all sorts of casually found and cheap articles in our everyday environments (homes, hotels, hospitals, etc.) are being systematically digitized and service enabled in order to exhibit a kind of real-world smartness and sagacity in their individual as well as collective actions and reactions. Thus trillions of digitized objects, billions of connected devices, and millions of polyglot software services are bound to interact insightfully with one another over locally as well as with remote ones over any networks purposefully. And hence the amount of transactional, operational, analytical, commercial, social, personal, and professional data created through a growing array of interactions and collaborations is growing very rapidly. Now if the data getting collected, processed, and stocked are not subjected to deeper, deft, and decisive investigations, then the tactically as well as strategically sound knowledge (the beneficial patterns, tips, techniques, associations, alerts, risk factors, fresh opportunities, possibilities, etc.) hidden inside the data heaps goes unused literally. For collecting, stocking, and processing such a large amount of multistructured data, the traditional databases, analytics platforms, the ETL tools, etc., are found insufficient. Hence the Apache Hadoop ecosystem technologies and tools are being touted as the best way forward to squeeze out the right and relevant knowledge. In this chapter, you can find the details about the emerging technologies and platforms for spearheading the big data movement.}

Game theory (GT) is a mathematical optimization technique that can be used to solve problems in wireless communication including security, resource allocation, power management, node rewards and punishments, and balancing numerous trade-offs. The complicated interactions between the server and the edge devices are interpreted using GT to maximize their utility.

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 has changed today's manufacturing scenario. The need to make manufacturing systems agile, adaptive, resilient, and robust, due to the pandemic, has expediated the adoption and implementation of smart manufacturing technologies. Despite the interest of manufacturers in smart manufacturing, the adoption rate has been slow. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can be especially hindered in adoption due to the lack of a transition strategy and identification of relevant technologies required to achieve a smart factory. Although there is literature that provides maturity and readiness models and toolkits for adoption, the decision-making models for SMEs are inadequate. This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision-making model as a tool to provide a means for evaluating a large range of smart manufacturing technologies while considering the status quo for SMEs. The aim of this project is to aid SMEs in the adoption of smart manufacturing technologies by providing a roadmap to assess performance parameters and identify an appropriate smart manufacturing technology for adoption. The recommended technology is tailored to the requirements of the SME using fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The fuzzy TOPSIS technique aggregates the opinions of decision makers and uses a fuzzy environment to account for their subjectivity. The inclusion of personnel as provided by the model from various hierarchical levels promotes favourable implementation by insertion in the transition process while also educating the personnel of the technologies. An industry case study with individuals from an SME, Levil Technology, and Florida's Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Center, FloridaMakes, is conducted to assess the preference for five smart manufacturing technologies over a range of eleven criteria pertaining to performance, sustainability, quality, cost and maintenance. The results give clarity regarding the preference for critical manufacturing criteria by assigning weightage, and identifies the most relevant technology catering to the preferred criteria. Predictive analytics for asset health monitoring was found to be most preferred followed by a digitally connected factory for visibility into production operations. The determination of rank will allow manufacturers to assess the manufacturing alternatives with respect to the key performance indicators for transition to Industry 4.0.}

However, many of the CMaaS platforms are centralized with data flowing through an intermediary agent connecting clients with service providers. This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.}

abstract = {Just-in-time delivery, shorter product life cycles, demographic changes, and the Covid-19 pandemic have driven the industrial application of collaborative robots in warehouses. These robots work alongside humans, increasing their productivity and relieving them of repetitive or strenuous tasks. However, human workers can be reluctant to collaborate with robots owing to certain fears; for example, they may be concerned about job loss, stress, expected effort, or risk to physical integrity. These concerns can negatively impact the acceptance of human–robot collaboration (HRC). As the literature on this topic is fragmented, this study analyzes HRC acceptance in warehouses based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. We identify, classify, and analyze studies examining HRC acceptance in warehouses using a systematic literature review methodology. A framework is established to guide the analysis of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, (perceived) occupational safety, psychosocial, and legal and privacy factors. The results indicate the importance of corporate infrastructure and consideration of cognitive factors in particular. The findings of this study will support future research on HRC in warehouses and provide guidance for managers regarding HRC applicability.}

abstract = {In the last decade, a shift toward Sustainable Development (SD) in engineering has started in the educational and occupational framework. Therefore, the need to rethink the professional figures of an engineer has become a necessity. Unfortunately, neither a formal methodology to define a standard engineer archetype nor procedural methods to evaluate such archetypes’ contribution to SD are investigated. This paper bridges the first gap by proposing a general methodology to define specific engineer archetypes as technical competences from educational - Semi Structured Intended Learning Outcomes (SS-ILOs) - and occupational - European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) - frameworks. The second gap is addressed by a procedural method based on indirect mapping of the identified archetypes onto United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). Since Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the working environment of future engineers and has a promising potential to achive SDGs, I4.0 technologies influences on SDGs are used as a bridge to evaluate sustainability of the defined enigineer archetypes. Finally, we provide the application of our proposed methodology to the Industrial engineering case study. The results show that significant limitations toward sustainability remain open challenges. However, the intrinsic nature of the industrial engineer is confined to some specific goals, and a characteristic signature on sustainability emerged.}

Key learnings from the International Congress on Engineering and Food, ICEF13, held in Melbourne, Australia, in September 2019, are highlighted. Some of the food systems and innovation trends conveyed in keynote talks, oral presentations, and e-posters summarized here are detailed in the chapters of this book and in special issues of two reference food engineering journals. A global overview of biosystems engineering solutions for developed and developing countries includes alternative protein sources, postharvest engineering for food waste transformation and sustainability. Then, advances in food processing technologies including refrigeration, freezing, thermal and nonthermal processing, and drying are discussed. An update on the innovative use of technologies such as extrusion for alternative ingredient production and innovative texturization, 3D food printing for personalized structuring and nutrition, pulsed electric field or hydrostatic pressure for structuring, as well as precision fermentation and other methods for bioactive incorporation is provided. The chapter also covers advances in ecofriendly antimicrobial and intelligent packaging with in-built micro- and nanosensors. Other sensor technologies integrated into digital manufacturing using Industry 4.0 are presented in the context of the food supply chain. Engineers are increasingly involved in consumer health research by creating more representative in vitro mimetics of human oral processing and digestion devices that are coupled with nutrient delivery models. The chapter concludes with suggestions to modify the food engineering curricula to (a) prepare food engineers of the future for global challenges appearing in both developing and developed countries, and (b) develop broader technical, interpersonal, and integrated regional and global supply chain skills. Food engineering will continue to play an important role in the development of cutting-edge smart processes that transform and personalize foods targeting individual nourishment and improved body function via controlled delivery strategies. Therefore, food engineering is broadening the scope beyond conventional unit operations and process design and optimization, to include environmental assessments, bioprocesses in the human body, and digital tools to identify circular and cost-effective solutions, and develop sustainable food systems.}

abstract = {Real-time information management systems (RTIMS) are emerging for the mining industry. RTIMS are created to enable minimal-latency (real-time) of information delivery and usage to enable dynamic and smart decision making. However, being an emerging concept, it is unclear what the target readiness of RTIMS should be. As a result, system owners may face challenges identifying appropriate RTIMS performance models. In this study, RTIMS is treated as an integration of information, as a resource and as the systems for managing this resource, in real-time, across all phases of the mining value chain. Consequently, the capability maturity assessment tool for RTIMS must consider: information as the critical resource; the management systems for the critical resource; and the access to the resource in real-time. Thus, a hybridised maturity model is proposed for the RTIMS maturity target, which can be further optimised through stakeholder engagement. In our proposed framework, three elements namely, people, the environment, and technology, have been identified as key enablers for RTIMS in the minerals sector. In addition, we propose a six-level capability maturity model, with levels ranging from 0 to 5, signifying the state of no recognition of the processes to an optimised state, where prevention and maintenance are the norm.}

A set of advanced technologies for digitalisation and a theory-based set of seven value drivers for PSM are identified for the proposed grid to facilitate the design of applications and interventions for digitalising PSM. The grid relates the digital technologies to the PSM value drivers in a matrix-like manner, allowing the structured consideration of the space defined by these two dimensions. The proposed approach to the strategic evolution of digitalisation in PSM is tested and its utility is demonstrated in analyses of practitioner literature and multiple case-study-based perspectives on PSM digitalisation. Two fundamental design principles relating to the use of the grid, or to the filling of its space, are set out, thus the research provides new theoretical perspectives on the design of advanced forms of PSM digitalisation. The proposed grid may be used in application design, communicating current and future states of PSM digitalisation to stakeholders, and specifically in developing a future-oriented strategy with a digitalization element for the PSM function.}

abstract = {Existing literature on microgrids (MGs) has either investigated the dynamics or economics of MG systems. Accordingly, the important impacts of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) on the economics and dynamics of MGs have been studied only separately due to the different time constants of studies. However, with the advent of modern complicated microgrids, BESSs are bridging these two domains. Thus, there is a need to study how these two are related in conjunction with each other. Looking at both the economics and dynamics of MGs and exploring their links will help researchers develop joint Econo-dynamics models, notably in the context of digital twin technology, that could be the future trend toward net-zero emission systems. This paper reviews, analyses, and classifies BESSs applications based on their time constants. The classified BESS applications are: 1) synthetic inertia response; 2) primary frequency support to compensate for the slow response micro-sources; 3) real-time energy management for covering intermittent renewables; 4) economic dispatch for improving steady-state performance, and 5) slack bus realization. Research gaps and future trends have been discussed throughout the paper and are summarized in the future trend section.}

Current literature on I4.0 technologies tends to overemphasise the positive impact and transformational capabilities of digital technologies while there is little focus on evaluating potential risks associated with their adoption in industrial operations. An understanding of how supply chain risks are perceived in digitalisation projects within industrial operations and an understanding of decision-makers' responses to different types of risks has important managerial implications. Current literature, however, lacks systematic empirical evidence on the implementation of I4.0 applications and related risk factors. This study aims to address this research gap by exploring the relationship between I4.0 technologies and supply chain risks based on empirical evidence from 300 case studies of industrial practice in Germany and fifty-three interviews with relevant managers from selected use cases and with general experts in this field. Our findings show that digital technologies are frequently adopted to address certain existing supply chain risks but that their implementation introduces new sources of risks (e.g. cyber risks). Based on qualitative data analysis and drawing on Normal Accident Theory, we propose a framework to explicate the drivers and contingency factors of new sources of supply chain risks in the context of Industry 4.0 technologies. Practical recommendations are provided for supply chain managers to guide the process of managing supply chain risks based on the technological life cycle.}

It is widely recognized that technology in all its forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly, researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate friendly society.}

Ontologies play an important role in SOCx as they facilitate data readability and reasoning by machines. A better understanding of ontologies is required in order to develop and incorporate them in SOCx. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art research on building data ontologies since 2014 within the SOCx domain through sorting them based on building data types, general approaches, and applications. The data types of two main domains of building information modeling and building management system have been considered in the majority of existing ontologies. Three main applications are evident from a critical analysis of existing ontologies: (1) key performance indicator calculation, (2) building performance improvement, and (3) fault detection and diagnosis. The key gaps found in the literature review are a holistic ontology for SOCx and insight on how such approaches should be evaluated. Based on these findings, this study provides recommendations for future necessary research including: identification of SOCx-related data types, assessment of ontology performance, and creation of open-source approaches.}

If an organization wants to stay competitive, it won’t just be able to respond to changes, it should expect them and stimulate innovation itself. To do this, companies need to plan ahead and be active designers for their future. This is where the digital transformation strategy comes in. The digital transformation strategy helps leaders answer the questions for their business such as the current digitalization level, future vision, and how to get there. To be protected from digital disruption, companies need to develop three core competencies related to awareness, informed decision-making, and rapid implementation.

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution, also labelled Industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. These new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. They also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Organizations need to consider Industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. Sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. In this study, we further examine Industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. We introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. We also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and VIKOR. This method can effectively evaluate Industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. We apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the World Economic Forum. The results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. Our recommendation is to take advantage of Industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. Investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.}

abstract = {The Physical Internet (PI), a new vision for the future of the global freight transport and logistics system, describes a geographical hierarchy of interconnected networks of networks, from the urban, to the national, the continental, and the global level. Like today, in PI the maritime ports will fulfil roles as continental and global hubs. Differently than ports today, however, decisions to split and bundle cargo across ships and other modes will not be made solely on the basis of long-term agreements by ports, but rather ever more dynamically and in real-time, aiming to reconsolidate shipments within the port area. This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally. We provide insights into the approach’s applicability by means of the illustrative case of Teesport, located in Northeast England (United Kingdom).}

Cloud supply chain integrates concepts and technology of Industry 4.0 and digital platforms emerging in the “supply chain-as-a-service” paradigm. This paper conceptualizes the cloud supply chain as a new and distinct research area. Through analysis of practical cases, we deduce some generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain. In the generalised model, we formalize supply chain multi-structural dynamics and dynamic service composition. Our results show that the main generalized characteristics of the cloud supply chain are related to (i) multi-structural dynamics; (ii) platforms, digital supply chains, ecosystems, and visibility, (iii) dynamic service composition with dynamically changing buyer/supplier roles, (iv) resilience and viability, and (v) intertwined supply networks and circular economy.

One reason for this delay is assumed to be that the initial efforts were mainly on business and service when design was an afterthought. The promising digital technologies that have become easily implementable in practice will in the next years facilitate design and implementation of IPS² smartly to satisfy users and contribute to sustainability. This keynote analyses literature and practice in the last decade, aiming to propose the main characteristics of IPS² of the future and design processes adequate for IPS². The design process of both production systems for sustainability and high-value systems for sustainable development goals may need to be supported differently than today.

The application of ontology is especially relevant when designing control systems for smart distributed energy systems. The development of such systems is accompanied by different problems, primarily caused by the lack of a unified and sufficient information environment for describing the subject area. In this regard, it is important to ensure the advancement of the ontology for distributed energy systems using existing CIM standards and various extensions that include entities specific to the domain of decentralized energy. The paper describes an approach to the formation of the ontology of smart distributed energy systems, assesses the possibility of using existing ontologies to extend CIM, and considers the matter of integrating a CIM-based ontology with other domain ontologies. A description of an ontology update process is presented, which ensures the maintenance of the ontology in a form that corresponds to the needs of the digital platform stakeholders. The developed ontology is planned to be used to form a unified information model of the distributed energy domain when developing a Russian digital platform for managing distributed energy resources - the ∀Platform.}

abstract = {The industrial revolution 4.0 (I4.0), internet of things developments, and the expansion of online web services have caused exponential growth and deployment in the number of cloud data centers(CDC). Cloud computing is a paradigm that enables tenants to use storage and computing resources in the pay-per-use model. Cloud service providers maximize their profits by distributing the tenant’s demands to the reserved storage and computing servers, minimizing the reservation cost with the satisfaction of the tenant’s quality of service level agreement. Workload prediction and resource management are fundamental and critical problems due to cloud-distributed infrastructure and nonlinear dynamic workload conditions. Conventional prediction techniques in a cloud environment provide the one-dimensional output. Existing solutions mostly forecast resources, such as CPU and memory usage, each as a single output. However, the one-dimensional output in the form of resource provision and usage is not able to capture the relationship of application requirements of multiple resources such as CPU, memory, CPU cores, Disk, and network, which result in inaccurate prediction results and limited information. Efficient resource management requires predicting multiple resource parameters using multivariate state variables for efficient resource allocation. This study proposes an intelligent computing framework based on multivariate time-series bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) forecasting for predicting cloud virtual machine resources. We consider multi-dimensional resources such as CPU provisioned and usage, memory provisioned and usage, CPU cores, Disk write and read throughput, and network receives and transmit throughput. We investigate several deep learning techniques the proposed multivariate BiLSTM, LSTM, stacked BiLSTM, stacked BiLSTM with LSTM, and BiLSTM auto-encoder. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on two real workload traces: Bitbrains traces fastStorage and Rnd. The performance metrics used to evaluate forecasting accuracy are the root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. Furthermore, we observe the training-testing data size and the historical window size variation effects on these models.}

IoV aims to increase road user safety and lower accident rates. It is one of the main components of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). ITS appears as the most crucial component since the cities in any country are evolving into digital civilisations as a result of the smart city concept, regardless of whether people are travelling within the city, to work, in school, or for other purposes. It can also be used to improve infrastructure utilisation and road safety (i.e., reduction in road accidents), in addition to enhancing traffic management and easing congestion. However, IoV-driven ITS is susceptible to several forms of attacks because of the insecure communication among the participating entities. We, therefore, propose a secure authentication protocol for IoV-driven ITS to stop these attacks from happening (in short, SAKP-ITS). Its resistance to a number of potential attacks is confirmed by the security analysis of the proposed SAKP-ITS. Additionally, SAKP-ITS is juxtaposed with other comparable competing methods put out in an IoV environment. Additionally, it has been found that SAKP-ITS outperforms competing schemes in terms of critical metrics like communication costs, computation costs, and security and functionality attributes. To test the effect of the proposed SAKP-ITS on the critical performance attributes, a practical implementation of SAKP-ITS is also presented.}

abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoDs) is getting growing interest of researchers due to its applicability in wide range of applications for transportation, weather monitoring, emergency monitoring for flood, earth quake, healthcare and road hazards. To update the data about emergency situation, a real-time data sharing is mandatory. However, regular message transmission by various drones may not only overwhelm a central server but it also causes congestion on the network. It is mandatory to reduce messaging cost and congestion. This paper presents a fog-assisted congestion avoidance approach for Smooth Message Dissemination (SMD). We present a message forwarding algorithm for congestion avoidance to select the appropriate next-hop node using layered model. This model is based on various layers having drones. In first phase, it looks for an appropriate drone in a layer near the fog server for message forwarding. In next step, the drone is identified in nearby layers to forward the emergency message to next-hop to further locate the group head as per priority. It is a drone that has less distance towards fog server and inform in its one-hop circle. It can stop forwarding message after delivering it to fog server. Finally, the fog server disseminates information timely towards upper layers for necessary actions for emergency situations. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations using NS 2.35. Results prove the dominance of SMD over counterparts in terms of messaging overhead, packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption and average delay. Proposed SMD improves PDR by 85% and message overhead cost by 91% as compared to counterparts.}

abstract = {The present study analyzes how a product manufacturer alters its strategic capabilities to become a smart solution provider by employing its dynamic capabilities. We scrutinize how a manufacturer facilitates strategic change by realigning its strategic capabilities and processes from a focus on technical product-development capabilities to product-service-software development capabilities, reconfiguring organizational routines focused on efficiency to routines focused on customer productivity, and shifting from a product logic to a service logic. By studying six leading manufacturing firms based on 86 manager interviews, the present study finds that strategic capabilities are renewed through dynamic capabilities, which involve a reconfiguration of strategic capabilities and processes. Furthermore, manufacturers need to consider the dynamic interplay between resource realignment modes (building digital capabilities, leveraging existing capabilities, accessing external capabilities, and releasing decaying capabilities), hence stressing their reinforcing mechanism to converge products, services, and software. For managers, our study highlights several strategic renewal practices designed to assist and benchmark how strategic capabilities are altered.}

abstract = {The aim of this study is to develop very short-term and accurate energy consumption forecasts for educational building. The purpose is to develop a predictive model for building energy planning to balance the supply from renewable power systems and the building electrical load demand). For the methodology, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used as a machine learning approach for building energy forecasting. The data for training (80%), testing (10%), and validation (10%) was used from smart energy meters installed in the building and weather data. A total of 20520 dataset instances was used for developing the forecasting model. The originality of this study is the ANFIS model was validated for the training, testing, and validation data, and the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting model was assessed over various very short time horizon of past data (0.5–4 h ahead). The main results reveal that the predictive model is extremely accurate in predicting the energy consumption of a building. The values of coefficient of correlation R for training, testing, and validation are 0.98017, 0.9778, and 0.97593, respectively, for the 30 min ahead energy forecasting. The R values for all the data are respectively 0.97951, 09854, and 0,96778 for the 0.5, 1, 4 h ahead energy forecasting. The low nMSE and nMAE errors for the ANFIS model demonstrate how well the model replicates the reported results from smart energy meters. The research findings are very important for the energy planning of microgrid power systems (energy purchase, building operations and maintenance, and demand side management).}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas—or concepts—in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies—such as big data, automation and robotics—is the central community discussion topic.}

abstract = {There is now widespread appreciation of the critical role played by supply chains in the global economy. Supply chains are dominant concerns for many organisations, governments, policy makers, and consumers. A primary requirement in addressing many contemporary supply chain challenges is the need to ‘map’ a supply system. With notable exceptions, much of the supply chain management literature has shied away from providing guidance on the mapping process. In this paper, we stress the reasons for the increased emphasis on mapping. We review the academic literature, highlighting the diversity of mapping exercises conducted by researchers and the lack of clarity about the different types of maps developed. Supply chain mapping has been used as an umbrella term for studies at very different aggregation levels. We define the fundamental elements needed to create a supply chain map and develop a formal hierarchy of supply systems for mapping at different levels of analysis. The hierarchy provides a structured way to consider the diversity of mapping exercises in the literature and to define the unit of analysis for a mapping study. We illustrate the hierarchy with a range of examples from the textile and apparel industry. We identify the primary and secondary data sources that can underpin mapping studies, highlighting the significant challenges in using them. We discuss the emerging commercial solutions to capture, map, and analyse supply systems for different purposes. In an increasingly data rich world, there are many opportunities to develop the supply chain mapping process further.}

Based on this methodological approach, this review includes 177 papers in the final analysis. I discuss the literature based on primary research strands and their analytical contributions to understanding spatial developments in the context of Industry 4.0. The review highlights five main topics that current research focuses on: (1) Value Chains and supply networks (2) Clusters and industrial districts (3) Readiness and adaptation of regional industries (4) Innovation developments and ecosystems (5) Labor market. In the analysis, it becomes particularly clear that the embedding in the theoretical fields of economic geography is so far very thin. The paper calls for a multi-scalar understanding of Industry 4.0 and outlines future research avenues with a focus on the emerging topic of digital geographies. Scholars need to put an emphasis on the role of the geography of digital innovations within socio-technical systems to better understand the spatial dimensions of the fourth industrial revolution and its impact on the economy, society, and environment.}

In this empirical work based on socio-cyber-physical assemblage thinking, first we found that on-site material and immaterial conditions like living on the farm, farm settings, and creative human work still matter and deserve more attention in responsible digital agriculture. Second, in our small sample we found that internet and cloud-computing are the main digital technologies used in on-farm diversification, particularly infrastructures-as-a-service and software-as-a-service. Third, when farmers introduce digital technologies in their diversification, three tentative configurations of socio-cyber-physical assemblages are outlined and can be further assessed in future research: punctiform, horizontal, and vertical configurations, or a combination thereof. For each configuration, we illustrate key features and examples. Nine clusters of factors were identified as affecting these assemblages. These factors could help researchers and practitioners to understand why the digitalisation of diversified farms can be so diverse and needs to be carefully adapted. For policymakers, these factors can also serve to qualify the setting up of conditions to steer integrated agri-food-rural policies towards on-farm diversification, including responsible digitalisation. The paper argues that digitalisation in agriculture can unfold through different strategies (minimising, mutualising, grounding, enlarging digitalisation) and requires holistic and ambitious policy commitments for sustainability. For example, the paper suggests the setting up of a new EU-wide target for increasing the share of farmers engaged in on-farm diversification through the Common Agricultural Policy or European Farm-to-Fork Strategy.}

The pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war presented challenges to emerging economies, emphasizing the need for advanced technologies to ensure continuity and improve performance. While previous studies have examined the direct impact of advanced technologies on performance, the integrated effects of these technologies and sustainable practices, as well as their mediating role between Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chain performance, remain unexplored. To address this gap, a second-order hierarchical component model was developed and tested using partial least square-based structural equation modeling. Construct dimensions and measurement items were determined through literature review and expert input from Bangladesh's readymade garment industries. A survey collected data from experts and supply chain professionals in various readymade garment industries in Bangladesh. The findings indicate that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies significantly and positively impacts sustainability performance. Additionally, green supply chain management and circular economy practices mediate the influence of Industry 4.0 technologies, contributing to sustainable supply chain performance. This study stands out as one of the few attempts to examine the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on sustainable supply chain performance, specifically in the context of Bangladeshi readymade garment industries with the application of green supply chain management and circular economy practices. The valuable insights from this study will guide industrial managers and regulatory authorities in implementing advanced technologies and aligning manufacturing practices with sustainable approaches, thus promoting environmental and socio-economic performance.}

abstract = {The information fusion field has recently been attracting a lot of interest within the scientific community, as it provides, through the combination of different sources of heterogeneous information, a fuller and/or more precise understanding of the real world than can be gained considering the above sources separately. One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.}

It aims to co-evolve cutting-edge models of educational delivery. This research cluster has emerged from the work of the INSYTE Centre located in the INSYTE-Cooley Research Lab (ICRL) in the Digitization Hub of the Luke Wadding Library at SETU, Waterford. Educational techniques have evolved over the past decades and these advances have not necessarily filtered down to various disciplines, e.g. engineering. The focus of this research cluster is to have the ‘Learner’ at the center of the ‘Learning Experience’ and to wrap the technology around them. This in turn, will increase the adoption and usage of such technologies. It will do this by cross-fertilization of knowledge over diverse domains to produce customised human-centred solutions for communities. Equality, diversity and inclusion are critical strands in this research. This paper shows that the European Union (EU) is supportive of changes in education required to close the skills gap in engineering and to enable reskilling to support Industry 5.0. In addition to the creation of cutting-edge models of educational delivery the vision of this multidisciplinary human centered research cluster is the establishment of a state-of-the-art pilot factory as an Irish national initiative in SETU, Waterford.}

Digital technologies are now leading us into the fourth agricultural revolution, where sustainable food production is supported by technologies that collect data useful for farm and supply chain performance improvement, along with task automation and compliance. However, the potential benefits of digital agricultural futures are uncertain and plagued by unrealized expectations of previous innovations. The aims of this paper are to articulate current trends in technology and livestock systems and anticipate future trajectories for Agriculture 4.0 in relation to meeting sustainability and animal welfare outcomes for livestock systems. We use a ‘Futures Triangle’ approach to review the role of technology in livestock systems. The main findings are that previous work envisioning technological livestock futures have favoured pull of the future factors (techno-optimists) or weight of the past (techno-pessimists), rather than a balance of pull, push and weighting factors. Responsible Agriculture 4.0 innovation requires public–private collaboration of innovation system stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, consumers, as well as technology developers, to enable development of transition pathways from a systems perspective. The use of responsible innovation processes, including anticipation on alternative futures, should also be built into innovation processes to support critical reflection on technological trajectories and related innovation system consequences, both desirable and undesirable.}

Through qualitative content analysis, expert interviews and discussion rooted in recent literature, key insights on the practical challenges and opportunities of blockchain energy applications are investigated. This is done in technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions in order to propose holistic insights. Key dentified issues include scalability, data privacy, costs of change, market dynamics, user experience, skills, multi-stakeholder governance, and regulatory change. Key identified opportunities also range across these dimensions, such as blockchain advancements, power market development, user research, and regulatory sandboxes. While most research on blockchain energy applications has been from the technological lens, this paper contributes with a multi-dimensional approach. The interrelatedness among these dimensions is one of the key messages of this paper. Both corporate strategy and public policy development need to integrate user behavior research, business model innovation and regulatory experimentation for a holistic approach in understanding and implementing blockchain, and other emerging technologies. It is suggested that the multi-dimensional challenges and opportunities identified in this study, and functioning of their interrelatedness, are of interest for further exploration both in academia and among practitioners.}

In particular, the solar photovoltaic energy supply chain is used as a case study, encompassing the entire energy production process, from supply to disposal. An exhaustive literature review is conducted to identify the main criteria affecting social, economic and environmental sustainability in the photovoltaic energy supply chain, and to explore the potential impact of Industry 4.0 on sustainability. Subsequently, three Fuzzy Inference Systems combining quantitative and qualitative data are built to calculate the supply chain's social, economic and environmental sustainability. Experts' opinions are used to identify the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on the three pillars of sustainability for each supply chain stage. Finally, a novel sustainability index, Sustainability Index 4.0, is formulated to compute the overall sustainability of the photovoltaic energy supply chain in seven countries. The results show the applicability and usefulness of the proposed holistic model in helping policy makers, stakeholders and users to make informed decisions for the development of sustainable renewable energy supply chains, taking into account the impact of Industry 4.0 and digital technologies.}

This suggests how the shift from human-human to artefact-artefact and the increasing autonomy of the artefacts (technological beings), introduces specific features to each of the six Genres. Four features are identified in the later Genres that in combination, could be construed as, or indeed pose a threat: autonomy, intelligence, language, and autopoiesis. This paper advances the debate about future technological developments by using the proposed framework to structure an argument about the key issues that should be discussed today - so that the developments of tomorrow can be more reflectively considered, appropriately debated and knowingly pursued.}

In general, researchers desire to achieve global blockchain systems within a sustainable manufacturing domain; however, a number of technical challenges have come to exist in the recent decade, for instance, consensus algorithms and computing paradigms that can meet the privacy protection requirements of manufacturing systems. Therefore, an integrated decision-making framework called Pythagorean fuzzy-entropy-rank sum-Combined Compromise Solution (PF-entropy-RS-CoCoSo) is developed in this study, including two main phases. In the first phase, the PF-entropy-RS method is applied to obtain the subjective and objective weights of criteria to evaluate the technical challenges of transforming blockchain technology for a sustainable manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 era. The PF-CoCoSo model is then utilized in the second phase to assess the preferences of organizations over different technical challenges of the blockchain technology transformation for the sustainable manufacturing paradigm in the Industry 4.0 era. An empirical case study is taken to assess the main technical challenges of blockchain technology transformation for the sustainable manufacturing paradigm. Furthermore, a comparison analysis and a sensitivity investigation are made to demonstrate the superiority of the developed framework.}

Due to the complexity of the changing farm ecosystem, the new technological revolution's benefits will not be shared evenly. It is necessary to understand the problems and challenges that need to be addressed so that all countries fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0. This study aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by identifying descriptions, technologies, barriers, advantages, and disadvantages. Three independent researchers carried out a Systematic Literature Review based on the Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-established in the Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases, 50 articles were selected for analysis. As a result, it was possible to identify the descriptions of agriculture 4.0, propose a definition, and present a compilation of approaches related to the term. Technologies of agriculture 4.0, responsible for revolutionizing and impacting how commodities are produced, processed, traded, and consumed, were also surveyed. Moreover, the barriers that hinder the development of agriculture 4.0 and that limit its progress are listed. The barriers were classified into five dimensions: technological, economic, political, social, and environmental. These are issues that need to be resolved in different areas to achieve a larger scale in countries looking to implement agriculture 4.0. Finally, this study's findings support actors in the agricultural production chain and pave the way for the successful development of agriculture 4.0. Besides, research helps broaden the inclusive debate that can shape the introduction of agriculture 4.0.}

The purpose of a Smart City is to solve its inherent problems while simultaneously reducing its expenditure and improving its quality of life. Through the 4th Industrial Revolution technology, the advantages of Smart City are estimated to overcome the city’s expenses with city platformization. While a city traditionally is the subject of creation and not consumption, a Smart City currently is the key industry in generating more than 60% of its GDP in value creation from a production viewpoint. Moreover, with the expansion of online-offline convergence, cities can grow without limitation on its size, where connectivity and innovation determine the inclination of the city’s benefit-cost curve. As a city platform is responsible for connectivity, its value drastically increases through the 4th Industrial Revolution’s O2O (online to offline convergence) platform. When a city reflects on its own as a Digital Twin in the Cloud and when complete information becomes accessible through citizen’s participation through smartphones (Edge), Self-organization takes place, an ideal linkage between the city and citizens. Cities go through the self-organizing process of complex adaptive systems like the human brain. This research proposes a future model of a “Self-organizing City,” and suggests implementing the Smart City model based on the Smart City Tech-Socio Model in implementing strategies.}

abstract = {The forces of digital transformation have delivered significant benefits like sustainable development and economic growth in a range of early adopter industries such as retail and manufacturing but, despite these potential benefits, the resource and energy sectors have been relative latecomers to digitalization simply because they are frequently slower to absorb new technologies. Here we present the results of a systematic literature review identifying the ways in which digital technologies have been applied in the oil and gas, mining, and energy domains. We applied content and descriptive analysis to evaluate and discuss 151 academic articles selected from the Scopus database. Two particularly interesting trends emerge from the analysis. First, over 75% of the papers were about the energy sector excluding the oil & gas industry, and only a small minority were from the mining or oil & gas sectors. Second, the most frequently discussed objective of digital transformation was the reduction of operational expenses. By surveying the different ways in which these innovations have been used in these industries and identifying trends and patterns in how digital technologies have been applied, the findings of this review deepen our understanding of the current state of digital technologies within the resource and energy sectors and, in so doing, shine a useful amount of light on the contributions that digital transformation has made to businesses in these sectors. This paper also highlights for future scholars, practitioners, and policymakers the six research areas that they should focus on in the future to help the resource and energy sectors accelerate the digital transformation process and improve their ability to deliver value with these innovations.}

The global trends that we aim to scrutinize in this chapter are the five Ds, namely, decentralization, decarbonization, digitalization, deregulation, and democratization, which will roll up the life of every human being in the near future. Interestingly, future power systems will only be considerably affected by these Giga Trends, but also play a key role to further the mentioned Giga Trends. We believe that the 5D Giga Trends will result in some new characteristics for the future power systems in such a way that the existing approaches will not be sufficient to tackle the upcoming issues. As a result, understanding the power system transformation strongly depends on investigating the impacts of the 5D Giga Trends. It is anticipated that a tsunami of disruptions will happen in the future power systems due to these 5D Giga Trends along with the introduction of innovative technologies. This chapter addresses the role of the aforementioned global trends in the future power system, investigates the challenges faced by the existing power systems, and the opportunities due to the emergence of the Giga Trends in power systems are highlighted.}

If explainable and available carbon emission data can be accurately obtained, it will help policy regulators and enterprise managers to more accurately implement this development strategy. A lot of research has been carried out, but it is still a difficult problem that how to accommodate and adapt the complex carbon emission data computing models and factor libraries developed by different regions, different industries and different enterprises. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of the Industrial Internet, it has not only been used for the supply chain optimization and intelligent scheduling of the manufacturing industry, but also been used by more and more industries as an important way of digital transformation. Especially in China, the Industrial Internet identification and resolution system is becoming an important digital infrastructure to uniquely identify objects and share data. Hence, a compatible carbon efficiency information service framework based on the Industrial Internet Identification is proposed in this paper to address the problem of computing and querying multi-source heterogeneous carbon emission data. We have defined a multi cooperation carbon emission data interaction model consisting of three roles and three basic operations. Further, the implementation of the framework includes carbon emission data identification, modeling, calculation, query and sharing. The practice results show that its capability and effectiveness in improving the responsiveness, accuracy, and credibility of compatible carbon efficiency data query and sharing services.}

Developing smart technologies is a critical way to ensure that future manufacturing systems are sustainable. Blockchain is a next-generation development of information technology for realizing sustainability in businesses and industries. Much research on blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0 has been conducted from technical, commercial, organizational, and operational perspectives. This paper surveys how blockchain can overcome potential barriers to achieving sustainability from two perspectives, namely, the manufacturing system perspective and the product lifecycle management perspective. The survey first examines literature on these two perspectives, following which the state of research in blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing is presented, which sheds new light on urgent issues as part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We found that blockchain-empowered transformation of a sustainable manufacturing paradigm is still in an early stage of the hype phase, proceeding toward full adoption. The survey ends with a discussion of challenges regarding techniques, social barriers, standards, and regulations with respect to blockchain-empowered manufacturing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and social barriers that blockchain technology must overcome to demonstrate its sustainability in industrial and business spheres.}

abstract = {With artificial intelligence (AI) impacting every aspect of our lives, it is hardly surprising that the conversation around its potential impact on urban design and master planning should be moving rapidly toward the center stage. Architecture and urban design professionals took their time to digitalize their practice relative to manufacturing and engineering, for example, so it is not unexpected that embracing AI has not been a priority concern. With outliers, not least big-tech, no longer waiting in the wings to pick off the low hanging fruit from the urban designers’ digital workbench, the professions are waking up: the possibility that AI automation of niche tasks for certain clients might prove more compelling than calling upon for planning and urban designers time-honored professional expertise. Most in the profession, however, will not have studied still less absorbed artificial intelligence within their modus operandi. What is there to stop an alternative approach to urban design expertise from emerging, one which hybridizes and automates the finding of insights from rapidly expanding data sources displacing reliance on a lifetime of professional know-how? Key constituents of planning, social science, urban design, engineering, and computer science expertise lend themselves to being algorithmized. Their respective custodians need to be vigilant against the possibility of their human skills being supplanted by new “smart” digital tools. Fortunately, for the urban futures professions most at threat, there is a potential alternative bright future for those who can meld their creative skills with the smarts that a working knowledge of AI can bring to urban design. With relatively few designers learning the rudiments of AI, let alone learning how to deploy it, there is a risk that they assume AI has no place in creative practice. This could be matched by AI experts blithely assuming they can develop tools without appreciating the subtleties creatives bring to problem-solving: balancing the pros and cons of diverse options (the design approach) as opposed to homing in on the solution (the engineering approach). This brief chapter seeks to introduce a new agenda for addressing the divide between planning and urban design on one side of a yawning chasm, by bridging across to AI on the other. The core premise is fundamentally shifting urban development toward meaningful citizen participation within the planning and urban design processes leading to more sustainable and resilient future urban environments. Firstly, I will succinctly set the scene with some prognostications on the future of work to presage a positive perspective to the increasing automation of time-honored practices. For readers not especially familiar with AI, I have assembled a catalogue raisonné of 26 AI components such as “machine learning” and “pattern recognition” with a view to explicating the potential value of each within the digital urbanist's digital toolset. I follow this by describing an AI-enhanced alternative workflow for the professional planner and urban designer. It is hypothetical now given the contemporary constraints; the alternative workflow presumes that the current rapid advances in AI will continue. The alternative workflow speculates on how practice might profit (rather than suffer) from the transformative marvels that AI can bring to design when fully embraced. I conclude with some notes and a warning around the vexed issue of “expertise”: what are the risks and benefits of embracing AI within urban design in a world increasingly distrustful of human expertise, let alone robots?}

Smart manufacturing utilizes rich process data, usually collected by the SMS (e.g., machine tools), to enable accurate tracking and monitoring of individual products throughout the process chain. However, until now, the to-be-manufactured product itself has not contributed to the sensing and compilation of product and process data. More specifically, data measured from the product’s structure during its own fabrication. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the opportunity to actively use the capabilities of smart products within a SMS in terms of technical and economic feasibility. This opportunity emerged only recently with the advancements in smart products engineering. In this research, we developed a smart product prototype and evaluated it on a SMS testbed (CPlab) with eight distinct, fully-connected manufacturing processes. The results of the conducted experiments show the possibility to uniquely identify two distinct ‘fingerprints’ of manufacturing processes solely based on data provided by sensors within the smart product itself. The sensor data was collected directly from the smart product before manufacture was completed, yet after the intended sensor functionality during the product’s use phase was activated. The capability to automatically, accurately, and reliably identify process signatures and even inform the optimization of manufacturing parameters creates new opportunities for improvements in quality, scheduling, and seamless transparency across the whole value chain.}
