abstract = {The paper considers how 5G and 6G technologies fit within the broader context of EU industrial policies. It highlights that policies targeting 5G and 6G represent an interesting instantiation of a (relatively) novel and under researched type of EU industrial policy, which we describe as a “technology-specific” industrial policy. This approach, that departs from the traditional dichotomy between horizontal and vertical policies, has some desirable features that we highlight, but also raises some challenges. We focus on the key role these policies may play in drawing attention on demand and adoption patterns, especially if the implications of the GPT features of 5G and 6G are explicitly taken into account. The analysis suggests that much more emphasis should be given to demand-side innovation policies along with standard policies directed at final demand, to improving the vertical governance of EU policies so as to fully capture the technological opportunities key technologies open up and to the explicit consideration of the trade-offs behind the concrete implementation of this sort of policies.}

abstract = {Digital platforms offer opportunities to enhance the resilience of manufacturing supply chains facing complexity, data sharing challenges, external stressors (e.g., resource scarcity, geo-political factors), emerging risks and environmental sustainability. Despite the growing importance of digital platforms for industrial value creation, limited research has focused on their practical application in this context. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the holistic factors crucial for successful implementation is lacking. Through a qualitative empirical research approach involving three case companies in a manufacturing value chain, this study examines the challenges, requirements, and opportunities associated with leveraging digital platforms for resilient supply chains. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the use of a structured modelling technique, IDEF0, to identify interconnected antecedents that support the use of digital platforms in building resilience within manufacturing supply chains. The findings contribute to advancing knowledge in resilience modelling and dynamic capabilities for resilience, along with providing valuable insights for practitioners seeking to harness the potential of digital platforms for improved supply chain resilience.}

This development has facilitated the simultaneous recording of a wide range of data, which could contain abundant damage-related features. Concurrently, the age of omnipresent data started with massive amounts of SHM data collected from large-size heterogeneous sensor networks. The abundance of information from diverse sources needs to be aggregated to enable robust decision-making strategies. Data fusion is the process of integrating various data from heterogeneous sources to produce more useful, accurate, and reliable information about system behavior. This paper reviews recent developments in data fusion techniques applied to SHM systems. The theoretical concepts, applications, benefits, and limitations of current methods and challenges in SHM are presented, and future trends in data fusion methods are discussed. Furthermore, a set of criteria is proposed to evaluate contents and information from original and review papers in this field, and a road map is provided discussing possible future work.}

Product-centric approaches that present effective solutions in tightly integrated environments have been problematic to deploy across multiple industries and over longer timespans. Addressing deployment costs, incentives, and governance, this paper explores a blockchain-based approach for the deployment of product-centric information systems. Through explorative design science and systematic combining, the deployment of a permissionless blockchain system for collecting product life-cycle data is conceptualized, demonstrated, and evaluated by experts. The purpose of the blockchain-based solution is to manage product data interactions, to maintain an accurate single state of product information, and to provide an economic incentive structure for the provision and the deployment of the solution. The evaluation by knowledgeable researchers and practitioners identifies the aspects limiting blockchain-based deployment of solutions in the current industrial landscape. Combining theory and practice, the paper lays the foundation for a blockchain-based approach to product information management, placing design priority on inter-industrial and self-sustained deployment.}

The interpretive structural modeling technique is further used for mapping the interrelationships among various energy sustainability functions identified. The interpretive model developed, and the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement analysis offered exciting insights into the Industry 4.0-energy sustainability interactions. Findings show that Industry 4.0 promotes energy sustainability via a very complex mechanism that involves ten interrelated functions. Contrary to the general opinion, production efficiency offered by the digitalization of the manufacturing industry is not the immediate and most essential energy efficiency outcome of the digital industrial transformation. Industry 4.0 primarily contributes to energy sustainability by enabling the energy industry to reshape its operating landscape and enjoy more advanced, intelligent, and complicated energy production and distribution equipment. The digitalization of the energy demand sector, digitalization of the manufacturing industry, and the introduction of smarter and more sustainable products are among the main opportunities of Industry 4.0 for energy sustainability. Overall, the study and the ISM model of energy sustainability developed explains how Industry 4.0 contributes to energy sustainability via different functions and how each function is placed within the structural model based on its driving and dependence powers.}

abstract = {Continuous manufacturing, an emerging technology in the pharmaceutical industry, has the potential to increase the efficiency, and agility of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. To realize these potential benefits of continuous operations, effectively managing materials, equipment, analyzers, and data is vital. Developments for continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing have led to novel technologies and methods for processing material, designing and configuring individual equipment and process analyzers, as well as implementing strategies for active process control. However, limited work has been reported on managing abnormal conditions during operations to prevent unplanned deviations and downtime and sustain system capabilities. Moreover, although the sourcing, analysis, and management of real-time data have received growing attention, limited discussion exists on the continued verification of the infrastructure for ensuring reliable operations. Hence, this work introduces condition-based maintenance (CBM) as a general strategy for continually verifying and sustaining advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing systems, with a focus on the continuous manufacture of oral solid drug products (OSD-CM). Frameworks, such as CBM, benefit unified efforts towards continued verification and operational excellence by leveraging process knowledge and the availability of real-time data. A vital implementation consideration for manufacturing operations management applications, such as CBM, is a systems architecture and an enabling infrastructure. This work outlines the systems architecture design for CBM in OSD-CM and highlights sample fault scenarios involving equipment and process analyzers. For illustrative purposes, this work also describes the infrastructure implemented on an OSD-CM testbed, which uses commercially available automation systems and leverages enterprise architecture standards. With the increasing digitalization of manufacturing operations in the pharmaceutical industry, proactively using process data towards modernizing maintenance practices is relevant to a single unit operation as well as to a series of physically integrated unit operations.}

Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.}

Traditionally, food quality is determined using a range of destructive and time-consuming approaches with modest analytical performance, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel analytical techniques. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (called Industry 4.0) is progressing exponentially, driven by the advent of a range of digital technologies and other innovative technological advances. “Food Quality 4.0” is a new concept referring to the use of Industry 4.0 technologies in food analysis to achieve rapid, reliable, and objective assessment of food quality. In this review, we will first discuss the fundamentals and principles of Food Industry 4.0 technologies and their connections with the Food Quality 4.0 concept. Then, the most common techniques used to determine food quality will briefly be reviewed before highlighting the advancements made in analytical techniques to assess food quality in the era of Industry 4.0. Food Quality 4.0 is characterized by growing digitalization and automation of food analysis using the most advanced technologies in the food industry. Key aspects of Food Quality 4.0, including, among others, non-destructive fingerprinting techniques, omics technologies and bioinformatics tools, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, have great potential to revolutionize food quality.

At the same time, the energy generation gradually reshapes into decentralised network with lower capacity, but able to manage demand and supply in real-time. However, the penetration of online platforms within the energy sector poses policy questions that are specific to platforms' business models. This study investigates a sample of 217 digital platforms running energy-related activities across the EU regional markets. These energy platforms make about 20% of the world energy platforms. By observing their characteristics and those of their surrounding markets, it appears that the digital platforms in the European energy sector still tend to be relatively small and concentrated in specific regions, often in the neighbourhood of capital cities. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis suggests that market size, digital readiness and regulatory quality are the most important features relating to platforms' presence in the EU regional markets. This paper offers empirical evidence and reflections to provide energy policy with key information to best ripe the potential of new technologies while being aware of their inherited complexities.}

abstract = {Microgrids operate independently of the primary energy distribution network (islands) or synchronized with the primary energy distribution network. Microgrids are small-scale electrical networks that are often powered by a combination of solar, wind, or biomass energy to provide reliable green energy, though they may use fossil fuel energy resources. Microgrids can move the energy in response to peaks and troughs in supply and demand, resulting in no interruption in the power supply. A microgrid based on a viable model of microgeneration distributed from renewable sources with energy storage and energy management system is a strategic theme that leads to breaking paradigms. This technology meets the requirement of constituting an independent electrical system configured as a kind of “energy island.” In this generation, storage and consumption can work connected to the distribution network. A microgrid design seeks to integrate distributed generation sources, such as solar photovoltaic and wind energy, more efficiently with the electric grid and improve energy quality and availability levels. Microgrids have generation units locally, based on renewable sources and energy storage units, allowing them to operate in isolation, with only local resources, or connected to the electricity grid of the company’s energy concessionaires. This chapter aims to provide an updated overview of sources of microgrids and technologies, showing the fundamentals of this disruptive technology, incorporating solar energy and energy from photovoltaic cells, with a brief bibliographic background featuring the potential of these technologies.}

abstract = {Blockchain as an emergent decentralized digital technology has been widely explored in many sectors to remedy the deficiencies of centralized solutions It has been recognized that blockchain technology has great potential to facilitate business activities spanning the whole life cycle of a building project in the construction industry, such as better communication or understanding, documents sharing, stage transition and quality endorsement. A comprehensive review of the literature regarding the application of blockchain in the construction domain found that there are few studies and applications of blockchain in construction practices, and most of the current research involves qualitative studies only. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of applying both public blockchain and private blockchain technologies in the construction industry using two industry cases. Two business process cases (i.e., Case 1 and Case 2) were selected and used to drive the blockchain-based software system architecture design. The proposed architectures were demonstrated using Hyperledger Fabric (a private, permissioned and open source blockchain platform) and Ethereum (a public blockchain platform) respectively, to reflect the different requirements of the two use cases. This pilot study also illustrates the process, benefits, and challenges of adopting private and public blockchain technologies in construction domain. This research provides insights to researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption of blockchain technology, especially in construction industry.}

The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. ‘Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée àun Classement’ (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders – leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians – to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.}

The traction power supply system, a crucial component of energy conversion of the high-speed railway, will have a significantly changing form and operation. The form evolution motivations and the operation control objectives of the high-speed railway traction power supply system are first examined. Then describes the characteristics of the form evolution of the high-speed railway traction power supply system and summarizes the existing and evolving forms of its “source-network-load-storage” each link. Second, several workable architectures of the novel high-speed railway traction power supply system are presented, and the advantages, challenges, and prospects of respective options are compared. The above architectures are chosen while considering the energy resource endowment and high-speed railway line distribution in China. Lastly, the pertinent technologies of its operation control are presented based on the operational characteristics of the novel high-speed railway traction power supply system. The proposed technologies facilitate the bidirectional interaction of energy, information, and business in the novel high-speed railway traction power supply system. The Chinese railway industry will be encouraged to reach its high-quality and sustainable development goal by seizing the opportunity presented by the evolution of the high-speed railway traction power supply system in energy supply-side cleaner, energy demand-side electrification, as well as operation control intelligent.}

However, little has been done to understand how this ill-defined phenomenon may deliver its indented sustainability values despite these speculative promises. To address this knowledge gap, the present study developed a strategy roadmap that explains the mechanism by which Industry 5.0 delivers its intended sustainable development functions. The study first developed and introduced the Industry 5.0 reference model that describes the technical and functional properties of this phenomenon. The study further conducted a content-centric synthesis of the literature and identified the sustainable development functions of Industry 5.0. Next, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique was employed to identify the sequential relationships among the functions and construct the Industry 5.0-enabled model of sustainable development. The ISM involved collecting the opinions of 11 Industry 5.0 experts through expert panel meetings. Results revealed that Industry 5.0 delivers sustainable development values through 16 functions. Circular intelligent products, employee technical assistance, intelligent automation, open sustainable innovation, renewable integration, and supply chain adaptability are examples of the functions identified. These functions are highly interrelated and should be developed in a specific order so that the synergies and complementarities among them would maximize the sustainable development value gains. The roadmap to Industry 5.0-driven sustainability developed in this study is expected to provide a better understanding of ways Industry 5.0 can contribute to sustainable development, explaining how the development of its functions should be managed to maximize their synergies and contribution to the intended sustainability values. The study also highlights important avenues for future research, emphasizing the potential enablers of Industry 5.0 development, such as Government 5.0 or Corporate Governance 5.0.}

Companies wandered in a disrupted scenario because recommended actions/strategies to survive – and thrive – were not available an improvised actions to keep their operations up and running. This paper analyzes the COVID-19 impacts on the workforce and supply resilience in a holistic manner. The following research questions are discussed: (i) how can manufacturing firms cope with urgent staff deficiencies while sustaining at the same time a healthy and safe workforce in the perspective of socially sustainable and human-centric cyber-physical production systems?; (ii) is remote working (cf. smart working) applicable to shop-floor workers?; (iii) is it possible to overcome supply chain breaks without stopping production? In the first part, we propose three Industry 4.0-driven solutions that would increase the workforce resilience, namely: (i) the Plug-and-Play worker; (ii) the Remote Operator 4.0; (iii) the Predictive Health of the Operational Staff. In the second part, the concepts of (i) Digital & Unconventional Sourcing, i.e. Additive Manufacturing, and (ii) Product/Process Innovation are investigated from a novel business continuity and integration perspective. We ultimately argue that forward-looking manufacturing companies should turn a disruptive event like a pandemic in an opportunity for digital and technological innovation of the workplace inspired by the principles of harmonic digital innovation (that places the human well-being at the center). These aspects are discussed with use cases, system prototypes and results from research projects carried out by the authors and real-world examples arising lessons learned and insights useful for scientists, researchers and managers.}

The BCM models are based on data from a literature review of trends, interviews and workshops with relevant port stakeholders that validate the results. A specific case study is done for the Port of Barcelona. Some of the conclusions are suggested to be extended to other EU Ports. The results of this research are conceptual actions to be considered and introduced in port planning to ensure its sustainable growth in harmony with its nearby societies. Results suggest three main policy recommendations to foster new future business models for ports: 1) develop sustainable green energy hub models (energy communities, hydrogen strategies, etc.), 2) develop intermodal logistic hubs not only oriented to the maritime sector and 3) promotion of emerging industries to become a customization hub adding logistic value to the cargo transiting the port. All these recommendations are highlighted in order to define key drivers of a generic European port strategy masterplan.}

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is an efficient and secure machine learning technique designed for decentralized computing systems such as fog and edge computing. Its learning process employs frequent communications as the participating local devices send updates, either gradients or parameters of their models, to a central server that aggregates them and redistributes new weights to the devices. In FL, private data does not leave the individual local devices, and thus, rendered as a robust solution in terms of privacy preservation. However, the recently introduced membership inference attacks pose a critical threat to the impeccability of FL mechanisms. By eavesdropping only on the updates transferring to the center server, these attacks can recover the private data of a local device. A prevalent solution against such attacks is the differential privacy scheme that augments a sufficient amount of noise to each update to hinder the recovering process. However, it suffers from a significant sacrifice in the classification accuracy of the FL. To effectively alleviate the problem, this paper proposes a Digestive Neural Network (DNN), an independent neural network attached to the FL. The private data owned by each device will pass through the DNN and then train the FL. The DNN modifies the input data, which results in distorting updates, in a way to maximize the classification accuracy of FL while the accuracy of inference attacks is minimized. Our simulation result shows that the proposed DNN shows significant performance on both gradient sharing- and weight sharing-based FL mechanisms. For the gradient sharing, the DNN achieved higher classification accuracy by 16.17% while 9% lower attack accuracy than the existing differential privacy schemes. For the weight sharing FL scheme, the DNN achieved at most 46.68% lower attack success rate with 3% higher classification accuracy.}

This paper presents a Machine Learning based caching and transcoding model, which helps release the burden on the backhaul links of the network. The purposed scheme contains a task scheduler and time estimator. The time estimator predicts the job’s transcoding time based on the Virtual Machines (VMs) load. The task scheduler maps the transcoding task to different VMs regarding the cost feasibility, Quality of Service (QoS) of the users, and the cost-to-performance ratio of VMs. For this purpose, we prepare a dataset of 500 videos and transcode each video in every lower representation using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The time estimator is trained on 77% of the video dataset containing more than 80,000 transcoding time data of different videos. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of cost, average delay perceived by the user, and backhaul burden.}

abstract = {Research on model-based engineering (MBE) has occasionally touched upon the relationship between development processes and concrete MBE practices. However, the alignment of these elements has rarely been the central focus of these studies. As a result, important questions regarding the alignment of MBE and development processes, as well as the impact of development processes on the utilization and success of MBE, have remained unanswered. To address this research gap, we conducted a multiple-case study involving 14 individuals from nine different companies, conducting a total of 12 interviews. Building upon seven propositions derived from existing literature, our investigation sought to understand how MBE is aligned with the development process and explore the application of MBE in this context. Additionally, we identified challenges and needs in this area. Our findings challenge some previously reported results, such as the perceived conflicts between agile development processes and MBE. Furthermore, we unearthed previously unreported issues, like the importance of considering the perspectives of tool vendors in MBE discussions. Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on how MBE is integrated into development processes, along with an examination of the social and organizational aspects inherent to these processes.

We then go through the privacy and security issues inside the metaverse, by addressing the privacy and security threats of utilizing clinical machine learning for intelligent e-health. From a human-centric perspective, privacy of social interactions among patients in a metaverse-enabled healthcare platform is also studied. We try to provide a holistic and less-investigated approach to help metaverse-as-a-health service providers facilitate the realization of secure and private e-health services from different aspects, ranging from the access layer to the social interactions among clients. Future vision and directions are also discussed to bring further insights for the network designers in the metaverse era.}

Beginning with some of the classical algorithms that were developed decades ago in Operations Research, we discuss how, today, decision making relies on increasingly massive amounts of data and highly sophisticated and powerful mathematical models. We show how an algorithm helps by either describing the world, forecasting it, or providing the decision-maker with prescriptive recommendations and suggestions to consider. To help readers wanting to dig deeper, we provide a bird's eye view of the fields of Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. We give some examples of the most impactful current approaches, together with a brief overview of the mathematics involved. We then present possible paths in which these tools may transform how supply chains may work and be managed in the future.

An evaluation through maturity models can support companies to better focalise their initiatives. However, the existing maturity models only focus on big data, and they lack of a scientific development approach and applications. They are also general in scope and not specific for manufacturing scenarios. This study provides an innovative maturity model, also including an assessment tool and an evaluation method. This model has been designed according to a well-founded methodology that is based on a structured procedure to assess maturity, as follows: organisation, data management, data analytics, infrastructure, governance & security. To enhance its validity, the model has been applied in three industrial companies working in the aerospace, automotive and machinery sectors. The results demonstrate the model's ability to leverage big data management and analytics through a deep, easy, and context-independent assessment that is focused on industrial scenarios. The suggested model enriches the state of art on big data and analytics maturity models providing a methodology and tool to apply on specific industrial case.

Agile work started spreading also to the manufacturing sector, thanks to the adoption of technologies that increasingly allow remote control of production systems. Nevertheless, agile working in the industry, namely Industrial Agile Working (IAW), requires organisational transformations and investments in technological innovations to guarantee its successful implementation. The first objective of this paper is to define the most relevant dimensions that affect the applicability of agile working practices in industrial contexts. The second objective is to develop an Industrial Agile Working Maturity Model (IAWMM) to measure the maturity of a company in adopting IAW practices. Starting from a set of dimensions identified through scientificic literature analysis, the IAWMM was tested by involving several companies in the manufacturing sector. The refined IAWMM was finally applied to a small sample of companies. The results report a good readiness of the companies concerning the knowledge and application of the key enabling technologies but still a low willingness concerning organisational change and flexible workforce management models. However, the IAW appears to be a promising strategy to promote a better workforce wellbeing and companies’ efficiency and resilience.}

It has therefore become a major target for reductions, in terms of both energy usage and CO2 emissions. In the light of progress in building intelligence and energy technologies, traditional methods for HVAC optimization, control, and fault diagnosis will struggle to meet essential requirements such as energy efficiency, occupancy comfort and reliable fault detection. Machine learning and data science have great potential in this regard, particularly with developments in information technology and sensor equipment, providing access to large volumes of high-quality data. There remains, however, a number of challenges before machine learning can gain widespread adoption in industry. This review summarizes the recent literature on machine learning for HVAC system optimization, control and fault detection. Unlike other reviews, we provide a comprehensive coverage of the applications, including the factors considered. A brief overview of machine learning and its applications to HVAC is provided, after which we critically appraise the recent literature on control, optimization and fault diagnosis and detection.

One of the main safety pillars is offering passengers a reliable emergency evacuation plan. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has disseminated guidelines for passenger ships to enhance the evacuation process understanding. Although the number of passenger ships is rising worldwide, implementing IMO's guidelines, particularly advance evacuation analysis, is still a young research area. Hence, this paper attempts to study previous research on human evacuation from the IMO perspective to uncover the current position of the issued guidelines in the literature. Accordingly, this research reviews 115 research publications published in scientific journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and doctoral and master dissertations from January 1999 to August 2022. As a result, the authors present the literature review of state-of-the-art papers to establish a firm foundation of past research. After identifying gaps, breakthrough points are clarified for future research about the benefits of handling uncertainty in input parameters, understanding human evacuation behavior, mutual interrelation among evacuation factors, and potential adoption of digital technologies in human evacuation from passenger ships.}

Besides, digitalization has brought a vast amount of information and data sources that MM may exploit to improve its processes and asset-related decision-making. This evolution of MM has brought a lot of opportunities but also various criticalities about information and data management. Data models are envisioned to provide significant support to this end. However, a common reference data taxonomy is needed for the correct development of data models. This work aims at exploring how the data taxonomy could help in addressing the current criticalities by synthesizing most information and data classes that support MM. The data taxonomy, along with other elements, like data models, effectively support companies in improving the management of their information and data. The usefulness of a data taxonomy is proved thanks to action research in a company within the automotive sector aiming at improving the MM process.}

We analyze sustainability in the digital supply chain by combining the supply chain SCOR model with the triple bottom line sustainability perspective that incorporates economic, environmental, and social dimensions. The complexities and trade-offs among these factors can lead to unintended consequences for sustainability initiatives. We consider two illustrative case studies: the emerging supply chains for electric passenger vehicles and the beef supply chain. Automotive and agricultural supply chains have to deal with substantial and complex sustainability issues. We identify how digital technologies may support sustainability initiatives or create unintended negative consequences. We draw insights from the two cases to discuss important issues and questions for both research and practice.

Several research surveys for CAVs were conducted by primarily focusing on various security threats and vulnerabilities in the domain of CAVs to classify different types of attacks, impacts of attacks, attack features, cyber-risk, defense methodologies against attacks, and safety standards. However, the importance of attack detection and prevention approaches for CAVs has not been discussed extensively in the state-of-the-art surveys, and there is a clear gap in the existing literature on such methodologies to detect new and conventional threats and protect the CAV systems from unexpected hazards on the road. Some surveys have a limited discussion on Attacks Detection and Prevention Systems (ADPS), but such surveys provide only partial coverage of different types of ADPS for CAVs. Furthermore, there is a scope for discussing security, privacy, and efficiency challenges in ADPS that can give an overview of important security and performance attributes. This survey paper, therefore, presents the significance of CAVs in the market, potential challenges in CAVs, key requirements of essential security and privacy properties, various capabilities of adversaries, possible attacks in CAVs, and performance evaluation parameters for ADPS. An extensive analysis is discussed of different ADPS categories for CAVs and state-of-the-art research works based on each ADPS category that gives the latest findings in this research domain.

This paper presents the “CDAC AI life cycle,” a comprehensive life cycle for the design, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and solutions. It addresses the void of a practical and inclusive approach that spans beyond the technical constructs to also focus on the challenges of risk analysis of AI adoption, transferability of prebuilt models, increasing importance of ethics and governance, and the composition, skills, and knowledge of an AI team required for successful completion. The life cycle is presented as the progression of an AI solution through its distinct phases—design, develop, and deploy—and 19 constituent stages from conception to production as applicable to any AI initiative. This life cycle addresses several critical gaps in the literature where related work on approaches and methodologies are adapted and not designed specifically for AI. A technical and organizational taxonomy that synthesizes the functional value of AI is a further contribution of this article.}

We offer an extended vocabulary of goal types by presenting two novel conceptions: differential goals and integral goals, which we formalize in both linear-time and branching-time settings. We describe goal lifecycles and interactions and the extended notion of context for the representation of rapidly changing, complex operating environments.

Nevertheless, it is still in a nascent stage enduring uncertainties due to the lack of clear guidance about holistic digitalization contributions to the carbon neutrality process (CNP). Moreover, the intricate environmental effects provided by digitalization and digital mechanisms towards CNP present a fragmented landscape with controversial arguments, deserving further exploration. Addressing this gap, multidimensional macro environmental and economic impacts induced by digitalization - such as direct and indirect effects, rebound effects, spillover effects and higher-order effects - are systematically evaluated to answer the issues about whether digitalization can contribute to carbon neutrality. Furthermore, the synergetic management of digital application and carbon reduction are closely related to the energy value chain. To this end, by overviewing objective and comprehensive scenarios related to state-of-the-art digital technologies in multiple sectors of the energy value chain, this study proposes an integral mechanism framework by theorizing an undefined field about digitalization towards CNP in terms of sectoral innovation, energy systems, individual behaviours, carbon-related assurance, and energy security guarantees. Accordingly, this study also contributes to potential directions and rising policy expectations about further estimation of digital effects, broader digital scenarios towards CNP and sustainable digitalization.}

abstract = {The past decade has envisaged a paradigmatic shift in the digitalization of executing and recording financial transactions by developing intelligent algorithms, secured through cryptography. The architecture of blockchain technology holds tremendous potential for metamorphosizing various industrial sectors like healthcare, life sciences, and clinical and medical data management. In recent years, there has been a continuous surge for adoption in the biomanufacturing sector by enhancing supply chain management and customer relationship through blockchain technology. It confers substantial impact on bioprocess design, operational efficiency, reduced maintenance downtime, management of spare part inventory, and continuous online monitoring, paving the way for inevitable transformation in biomanufacturing sector. Thus, in this chapter, we highlight role of blockchain technology in the biomanufacturing sector by highlighting its implementation in various unit operations of the biomanufacturing sector. The technology is still in its nascent stage, but it can be desirable at a global scale for wider applicability to make the biomanufacturing sector more sustainable.}

abstract = {Existing platforms for collaborative BIM design have a centralized system architecture, which suffers cybersecurity risks of design data manipulation and denial of access, leading to a loss of data traceability, a decline in design productivity, and project delays. Blockchain is a promising technology to solve such risks by providing decentralized and immutable data storage. However, integrating blockchain with BIM faces a problem that blockchain is inherently unsuitable for storing large-sized design files like BIM models, hindering blockchain from protecting BIM data integrity. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed common data environment (DCDE) framework for BIM-based design leveraging two distributed technologies: blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The DCDE framework guarantees irreversible design changes storage using blockchain while secures design file storage using IPFS. A blockchain transaction data model and a smart contract are also developed within the framework to support DCDE functionalities. Lastly, framework applicability and performance are tested in an illustrative design example. Results show that: (1) DCDE is a feasible solution for secure design collaboration, and (2) DCDE latency (in millisecond-level), TPS (60 transactions per second), and storage cost (12.5 KB per day) are within an acceptable range.}

abstract = {In recent years, the need for Operational Technology (OT) defenses has been recognized, serving as an additional line of defense when Information Technology (IT) defenses are bypassed. This is no longer considered an uncommon possibility when dealing with advanced persistent threat (APT) actors expected to be state-sponsored and receiving insider assistance. In these extreme adversarial situations, OT defenses aim to provide another layer of defense for the system, introduced directly at the physical process level, as described by the sensors data, the system model, and control actions. Just like IT defenses, two schools of thought, i.e., passive and active defenses, have emerged to address this challenge. In active defenses, representing the focus of this paper, known signatures, synthesized based on the system's unique characteristics, are inserted into the system. In contradistinction, passive methods rely solely on observing system behavior in search of patterns of normal behavior with deviations thereof representing abnormal behavior. In their most sophisticated implementations, both passive and active defenses rely on the use of data analytics to identify the patterns and synthesize the observed and/or inserted signatures. Past research has shown that passive defenses may be bypassed by APT actors relying on data analytics and their intimate knowledge of the system to evade detection by respecting the patterns identified by the defenders. Thus, this manuscript explores the use of active defenses under the assumption that the attacker has privileged access to the system, including access to the system's model and sensors data. Specifically, this manuscript assesses the ability of active defenses to remain invisible to the attackers, and discusses the associated challenges that must be addressed to ensure their resiliency against APT actors.}

Cost decrease of sensors, wireless connectivity, and the opportunity to store big amounts of data pushed a process towards a next generation of IT industry. Manufacturing now has the opportunity to gather large quantities of data, coming from different areas, such as product and process design, assembly, material planning, quality control, scheduling, maintenance, fault detection and cover all the product life cycle phases. The extraction of value from data is a new challenge that companies are now experiencing. Therefore, the need for analytical information system is growing, in order to explore datasets and discover useful and often hidden information. Data analytics became a keyword in this context, but sometimes it is not clear how different methods or tools are defined and could be effectively used to analyze data in manufacturing. The paper aims to present and clarify the meaning of terms that are currently and frequently used in the context of analytics. The paper also provides an overview of the data analysis techniques that could be used to extract knowledge from data along the manufacturing process.}

This research investigates the need of blockchain in Industry 4.0 environment from Big Data perspective in supply chain management. The research method used in this study involves a combination of an Action Research method and Case Study research. More specifically, the action research method was applied in two industry case studies that implemented and tested the designed architecture in a global logistics environment. Case Study A examined the blockchain application in cross-border cargo movements whereas Case Study B investigated the application in a liquid chemical logistics company serving to petroleum industries. Our research analysis has identified that the Case A subject had disconnected systems and services for blockchain wherein the big data interactions had failed (failure case). Whereas in Case B, the company has achieved nearly 25% increase in revenue through its customer service after the blockchain implementation and thereby reduction in paperwork and carbon emissions (success case). This research contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge to big data and blockchain by identifying key implementation guideline and issues for blockchain in supply chain management. Further, action-based research coupled with a case study approach has been used to evaluate the application aspects of the architecture's scalability and functionality of bigdata and blockchain in supply chain management.}

For that purpose, we designed a questionnaire to explore the views of 20 teachers from each of the two universities selected, one in China and the other one in Spain, which applies an innovation and entrepreneurship education. The results show that the educational use of the metaverse is in its initial experimentation phase. Its application in innovation and entrepreneurship education is not limited to teachers' attitudes towards teaching, but rather to how the use of metaverse allows students to acquire real skills, which can contribute to the development of the society and improve international cooperation, thus creating a virtuous circle. Faculty training and university facilities remain limited for its implementation. Further research is needed on the data protection and privacy aspects on the practical educational use of metaverse.}

abstract = {During the last decade, wireless data services have had an incredible impact on people’s lives in ways we could never have imagined. The number of mobile devices has increased exponentially and data traffic has almost doubled every year. Undoubtedly, the rate of growth will continue to be rapid with the explosive increase in demands for data rates, latency, massive connectivity, network reliability, and energy efficiency. In order to manage this level of growth and meet these requirements, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications network is envisioned as a revolutionary advancement combining various improvements to previous mobile generation networks and new technologies, including the use of millimeter wavebands (mm-wave), massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) multi-beam antennas, network densification, dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission, and new waveforms with mixed numerologies. New revolutionary features including terahertz (THz) communications and the integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can further improve the performance and signal quality for future 6G networks. However, despite the inevitable benefits of all these key technologies, the heterogeneous and ultra-flexible structure of the 5G and beyond network brings non-orthogonality into the system and generates significant interference that needs to be handled carefully. Therefore, it is essential to design effective interference management schemes to mitigate severe and sometimes unpredictable interference in mobile networks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of interference management in 5G and Beyond networks and discuss its future evolution. We start with a unified classification and a detailed explanation of the different types of interference and continue by presenting our taxonomy of existing interference management approaches. Then, after explaining interference measurement reports and signaling, we provide for each type of interference identified, an in-depth literature review and technical discussion of appropriate management schemes. We finish by discussing the main interference challenges that will be encountered in future 6G networks and by presenting insights on the suggested new interference management approaches, including useful guidelines for an AI-based solution. This review will provide a first-hand guide to the industry in determining the most relevant technology for interference management, and will also allow for consideration of future challenges and research directions.}

This review makes an initial step towards shaping the role of AI in future railways and provides a summary of the current focuses of AI research connected to rail transport. We reviewed about 139 scientific papers covering the period from 2010 to December 2020. We found that the major research efforts have been put in AI for rail maintenance and inspection, while very limited or no research has been found on AI for rail transport policy and revenue management. The remaining sub-domains received mild to moderate attention. AI applications are promising and tend to act as a game-changer in tackling multiple railway challenges. However, at the moment, AI research in railways is still mostly at its early stages. Future research can be expected towards developing advanced combined AI applications (e.g. with optimization), using AI in decision making, dealing with uncertainty and tackling newly rising cybersecurity challenges.}

abstract = {“Product oriented” companies need to integrate new functions and services that are “user friendly” in order to stay relevant in the market. The growing data produced to support the development and the exploitation of these products, requires them to go within a Product Lifecycle Management or to modify it to take into account new needs. Most of time this leads to use disruptive technologies and innovative mindsets in order to well align tool market capabilities to industry businesses. The approach presented in this paper contributes to identify the product lifecycle management as an end-product composed of several compounds which can be managed within a system engineering process. The system engineering framework is used to propose a comprehensive picture of the operational, functional and structural breakdown need for the Product Lifecycle Management deployment.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a substantial role in the response to the challenges posed by the current pandemic. The growing interest in using AI to handle Covid-19 issues has accelerated the pace of AI research and resulted in an exponential increase in articles and review studies within a very short period of time. Hence, it is becoming challenging to explore the large corpus of academic publications dedicated to the global health crisis. Even with the presence of systematic review studies, given their number and diversity, identifying trends and research avenues beyond the pandemic should be an arduous task. We conclude therefore that after the one-year mark of the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic, the accumulated scientific contribution lacks two fundamental aspects: Knowledge synthesis and Future projections. In contribution to fill this void, this paper is a (i) synthesis study and (ii) foresight exercise. The synthesis study aims to provide the scholars a consolidation of findings and a knowledge synthesis through a systematic review of the reviews (umbrella review) studying AI applications against Covid-19. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and other preprint sources from 1st December 2019 to 1st June 2021 for eligible reviews. The literature search and screening process resulted in 45 included reviews. Our findings reveal patterns, relationships, and trends in the AI research community response to the pandemic. We found that in the space of few months, the research objectives of the literature have developed rapidly from identifying potential AI applications to evaluating current uses of intelligent systems. Only few reviews have adopted the meta-analysis as a study design. Moreover, a clear dominance of the medical theme and the DNN methods has been observed in the reported AI applications. Based on its constructive systematic umbrella review, this work conducts a foresight exercise that tries to envision the post-Covid-19 research landscape of the AI field. We see seven key themes of research that may be an outcome of the present crisis and which advocate a more sustainable and responsible form of intelligent systems. We set accordingly a post-pandemic research agenda articulated around these seven drivers. The results of this study can be useful for the AI research community to obtain a holistic view of the current literature and to help prioritize research needs as we are heading toward the new normal.}

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

In addition, multiple eavesdroppers are presented in the vicinity of the intended destination. Our aim is to enhance the secrecy capacity (SC) and to minimize secrecy outage probability (SOP) in presence of multiple eavesdroppers with the help of M-RIS in V2I communications. We propose a key-less physical layer security using beam-forming by exploiting M-RIS. The proposed approach assumes the concept of detecting eavesdroppers before the information can be transmitted via beam-forming by utilizing M-RIS. The results reveal that with consideration of M-RIS and beam-forming, the achievable SC and SOP performance is significantly improved while imposing minimum power consumption and fewer RIS reflectors.}

Among the researchers, there has been a significant focus on identifying, mitigating, and managing the risks that affect the supply chain (SC). Though the research on SCRM remains for an extended period, still the industries are facing difficulties in managing the SC risks. Also, the SC managers have begun to focus on decision-making based on numerous data sources for predicting the uncertainties more accurately to achieve a proactive and predictive intelligent risk management mechanism. These attributes make Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) suitable techniques in the SCRM field. The application of these techniques in SCRM is in a nascent stage. In this view, this paper presents a systematic and descriptive review of the literature and identifies the various AI and ML methods applied in different phases related to SCRM. Also, it investigates the different categories of SC risks and the existing articles based on the AI technique used. This analysis focuses on research articles related to SCRM from three scientific databases published between 2010 and 2021 for detailed study. Finally, this review provides unexplored and missing aspects in current research, challenges on implementing AI technologies, and describes promising avenues for the future.}

Open RAN integrates the benefits and advancements of network softwarization and Artificial Intelligence to enhance the operation of RAN devices and operations. Open RAN offers new possibilities so different stakeholders can develop the RAN solution in this open ecosystem. However, the benefits of Open RAN bring new security and privacy challenges. As Open RAN offers an entirely different RAN configuration than what exists today, it could lead to severe security and privacy issues if mismanaged, and stakeholders are understandably taking a cautious approach towards the security of Open RAN deployment. In particular, this paper analyzes the security and privacy risks and challenges associated with Open RAN architecture. Then, it discusses possible security and privacy solutions to secure Open RAN architecture and presents relevant security standardization efforts relevant to Open RAN security. Finally, we discuss how Open RAN can be used to deploy more advanced security and privacy solutions in 5G and beyond RAN.}

While utility-scale wind and solar connected to transmission networks remain the dominant sources of renewable energy, unprecedented growth in the uptake of DER introduces a paradigm shift toward decentralized electricity generation that leads to significant changes in the role of traditional distribution network utilities. The second section gives an overview of grid transformation in Australia that has already embarked on the grid transformation journey. Today, one in every three houses in many suburbs in Australia (South Australia and Queensland among the highest) generates a significant portion of their daily energy from their rooftop solar system. The boom in the rooftop solar, along with expected similar trends for electric vehicles and battery storage in the near future, has created an opportunity to transform the distribution network into an intelligent grid that supports a sustainable low-carbon future while benefiting all customers by maximizing the value from DER. Grid transformation at this scale requires major regulatory reforms that are briefly discussed.}

Separating the hype and “meta…” rebranding from current reality is difficult, as “big tech” paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact.

This chapter uses a number of practical applications and real-world examples to delve into blockchain's roles in contributing to these objectives. A key argument is that blockchain makes it possible to trace ingredients and components across multiple tiers of a supply chain because data must be shared in a tamperproof way and must be accessible to relevant parties. Blockchain, thus, facilitates traceability, which is among the key mechanisms by which blockchain can help firms meet the various supply chain objectives.}

This paper focuses on data preprocessing, aggregation, and clustering in the new generation of manufacturing systems that use the agile manufacturing paradigm and utilise AGVs. This paper presents a method by which it is possible to automatically detect the types of work performed by an AGV based on streaming information. The paper presents a comparison of results obtained with two different classical clustering algorithms: K-Means and DBScan. As the results show, using at least one of the proposed algorithms, it is possible to automatically detect the types of work performed by AGVs and to detect new, previously unknown types. Additionally, to a limited extent, it is possible to identify anomalies using this method. The proposed methodology can be used as the initial step for production optimisation, predictive maintenance activities, production technology verification, or as a source of models for the simulation tools that are used in virtual factories. This is an extended version of the ‘Data preprocessing, aggregation and clustering for agile manufacturing based on Automated Guided Vehicles’ paper [43].}

This breed of ad hoc networks leverages vehicles as nodes with Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication paradigm. Clustering is considered one of the most important techniques used to enhance network stability, reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, clustering employs bandwidth optimization by reducing the overhead and transmission delay and helps in mitigating the hidden node problem. To date, extensive research has been done to address clustering issues in vehicular networks, and several surveys have also been published in the literature. However, a holistic approach towards clustering in vehicular networks is still lacking. In this regard, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent advancements in the clustering schemes for vehicular networks. We take a holistic approach to classify the algorithms by focusing on, (i) the objective of clustering mechanisms (i.e., reliability, scalability, stability, routing overhead, and delay), (ii) general-purpose clustering algorithms, (iii) application-based (i.e., QoS, MAC, security, etc.) clustering, and iv) technology-based clustering (machine learning-based, nature-inspired, fuzzy logic-based and software-defined networking-based clustering). We investigate the existing clustering mechanisms keeping in mind the factors such as cluster formation, maintenance, and management. Additionally, we present a comprehensive set of parameters for selecting cluster heads and the role of enabling technologies for cluster maintenance. Finally, we identify future research trends in clustering techniques for vehicular networks and their various breeds. This survey will act as a one-stop shop for the researchers, practitioners, and system designers to select the right clustering mechanism for their applications, services, or for their research. As a result of this survey, we can see that clustering is heavily dependent on the underlying application, context, environment, and communication paradigm. Furthermore, clustering in vehicular networks can greatly benefit from enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence.}

abstract = {The impressive gains in deep learning (DL) started in 2012 and its successful utilization in image interpretation have led to the current momentum for artificial intelligence (AI) awareness and adoption. In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo software soundly defeated the best human Go champion Lee Sedol to introduce the capability of DL outside of image interpretation. More recently, there have been impressive exponential advances in natural language processing with transformer tools such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and now ChatGPT. DeepMind and its AlphaFold AI tool has been able to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins since 2021 and was Science magazine's “Breakthrough of the Year.” All of these AI accomplishments heralded the recent new era in AI. Major universities with AI departments (such as Stanford, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon) and technology giants (such as IBM, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft in the United States as well as other large companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent [BAT] in China) are all fervidly exploring real-life applications of AI. There is also a movement to democratize AI so that “no-code platforms” can accommodate people who do not know how to code [1].}

abstract = {This chapter is the culmination of the book by assembling all the conceptual, historical, strategic, structural, and case use elements of the preceding chapters to generate a single integrated blueprint of and roadmap to the future's (AI) thinking healthcare system, expressed in the unifying mathematical formula of the AI-empowered health ecosystem “DNA”: health equals the product of AI and equity squared (H=AE2). The chapter begins with considering the emerging high-level consensus descriptions of the future system model with its structural pillars (data, well-being, and integration) and features (AI, ambient, and collaborative). It then “fleshes” out the details of this form through the system's function, expressed as resilient integration driving health ecosystem operations: Data+well-being=Efficiency+equity. The chapter then seeks to demonstrate how the major structural elements of the future's health ecosystem (precision medicine, public health, telehealth, and safety) and their societal contextual elements (political economics and ethics) can be optimally arranged as “complementary ecosystem base pairs” in the system DNA above, with their double-helix “backbone” being the reality of each patient as a person in community with other persons, understood from a consensus-based pluralistic standpoint. It then seeks to illustrate this final conceptual framework in practical emerging cases including AI-powered well-being (in its global, strategic, and structural aspects), maturing enterprise-wide AI-powered healthcare (in its local, operational, and functional aspects), and emerging transformation trends (including dignity-security moral interoperability, strategic empathy, adaptive empowerment networks, embedded clinical trials, digital twins, quantum health, and liquid AI in cloud electronic health records). The chapter concludes by proposing how modern value-based healthcare systems can transform through efficient and ethical AI to become the future's thinking healthcare system operating as optimized health ecosystems in the global digital ecosystem that is self-aware, self-adaptive, and other-serving, with artificial intelligence integrated with human compassion, worthy of the patients it serves.}

abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) use renewable sources to meet the growing demand for energy with increasing consumer needs and technological advancement. They operate independently as small-scale energy networks using distributed energy resources. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and poor power quality are essential operational problems that must be mitigated to improve the MG’s performance. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced heuristic optimization mechanisms for MGs. However, local minima and the inability to find a global minimum in heuristic methods create errors in non-linear and nonconvex optimization, posing challenges in dealing with several operational aspects of MG such as energy management optimization, cost-effective dispatch, dependability, storage sizing, cyber-attack minimization, and grid integration. These challenges affect MG’s performance by adding complexity to the management of storage capacity, cost minimization, reliability assurance, and balance of renewable sources, which accelerates the need for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (MHOAs). This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of MHOAs and their role in improving the operational performance of MGs. Firstly, the fundamentals of MG optimization are discussed to explore the scopes, requisites, and opportunities of MHOAs in MG networks. Secondly, several MHOAs in the MG domain are described, and their recent trends in MG’s techno-economic analysis, load forecasting, resiliency improvement, control operation, fault diagnosis, and energy management are summarized. The summary reveals that nearly 25% of the research in these areas utilizes the particle swarm optimization method, while the genetic and grey wolf algorithms are utilized by nearly 10% and 5% of the works studied in this paper, respectively, for optimizing the MG’s performance. This result summarizes that MHOA presents a system-agnostic optimization approach, offering a new avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of future MGs. Finally, we highlight some challenges that emerge during the integration of MHOAs into MGs, potentially motivating researchers to conduct further studies in this area.}

We present a comprehensive review of SAGSI networks from a resource optimization perspective. We discuss use case scenarios and possible applications of SAGSI networks. The resource optimization discussion considers the challenges associated with SAGSI networks. In our review, we categorized resource optimization techniques based on throughput and capacity maximization, delay minimization, energy consumption, task offloading, task scheduling, resource allocation or utilization, network operation cost, outage probability and the average age-of-information, joint optimization (data rate difference, storage or caching, CPU cycle frequency), the overall performance of network and performance degradation, software-defined networking, and intelligent surveillance and relay communication. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in SAGSI networks.}

abstract = {Counties are unique on the services they provide and on their relation to the land, the state, and neighboring municipalities. Smart technologies have the potential to transform cities, but the idiosyncrasies of counties pose some specific challenges in relation to geography, distance, remote populations, isolated communities, obligations to the state, and necessary relations and collaboration with neighboring municipalities. Some smart technologies, such as in utilities, will be best implemented when planned and organized by a regional organization that spans across cities and counties. Other technologies can be planned and implemented internally to serve the county residents, while some will require complicated agreements with neighboring municipalities and participating private entities and corporations. In all cases, the triad of major participants in this transformation are corporations, government, and citizens with all the inner power dynamics such coexistence creates. The smartification process spans a wide spectrum of county departments, and each one has the potential to address county challenges, be involved, and benefit accordingly. When implementing smart technologies, however, it is important to keep in mind general considerations of economy, society, environment, quality of life, and “place” as general guides in policy creation and understand that the goal is not to simply implement technology and acquire the label “smart city” and “smart county,” but instead, to benefit the community, improve quality of life, and create “place.” This presents a juxtaposition of instrumental versus value-based approaches to smart technologies, which is a major philosophical issue at the base of the theoretical implications of smartification. An instrumental approach has the potential of deducing inadequate conclusions by focusing solely on sensor inputs and ignoring the multilayered experience of the human milieu, while a value-based approach will always keep in mind the values of the community to guide policymaking. Finally, it is paramount not to forget that Smart Growth is an entirely different phenomenon than smart technologies, which, contrary to smart growth, have limitations in creating architectural and urban spaces. Both approach quality of life from a very different perspective, can both contribute positive results, but smart technologies lack the ability to create a foundation of good urbanism.}

Whether the business model changes and economic development facilitated by digital technologies will enable China to achieve its goal of a low-carbon transition remains to be seen. Based on 269 cities in China from 2006 to 2021, the study used two-way fixed effects and instrumental variables to analyze the role of DT in carbon reduction and its indirect mechanisms. The results indicate that the wide application and deep integration of DT in the physical industry will reduce carbon emissions (CE). The mechanism analysis reveals that DT, with its efficient, integrated, and green characteristics, will help improve energy efficiency and promote green technology innovation, thereby reducing CE. Most importantly, this study innovatively reveals the role of virtual agglomeration in carbon reduction. It uses data factors with production characteristics to shift the supply and demand parties and related enterprises from physical space to cyberspace agglomeration, which plays a significant positive role in the process of reducing CE. DT has a heterogeneous effect on reducing CE, especially in the sample of urban agglomeration and resource-based cities, which is more intense. The central government's policies on digital infrastructure and CE regulation influence the role of digital technologies in reducing CE. The conclusions of this study have implications for relevant market entities and the government to fully utilise DT to accelerate the realisation of green production and cope with climate change.}

Design of JPS Agent Framework and Routed Knowledge Graph Access components was required in order to provide backbone infrastructure for an intelligent agent system as well as technology agnostic knowledge graph access enabling automation of multi-domain data interoperability. Development of CityImportAgent, CityExportAgent and DistanceAgent showcased intelligent automation capabilities of the Cities Knowledge Graph. The agents successfully created a semantic model of Berlin in LOD 2, compliant with CityGML 2.0 standard and consisting of 419 909 661 triples described using OntoCityGML. The system of agents also visualised and analysed the model by autonomously tracking interactions with a web interface as well as enriched the model by adding new information to the knowledge graph. This way it was possible to design a geospatial information system able to meet demands imposed by the Industry 4.0 and link it with the other multi-domain knowledge representations of The World Avatar.}

Innovation through design is making the electricity industry experiences the same sort of rapid development as the information and communication technology industry has undergone during the past 30 years. Today, electrical utilities have the opportunity of seizing the potential of advanced communication, computing, and control technologies where smart technologies are the existing hub of innovation. To realize this fact, it is essential to integrate smartness and intelligence at all levels of the built environment infrastructure. This chapter explains how utilities and consumers are enabled to pool power from multiple plants and distributed sources to achieve high flexibility and scale by taking advantage of the smart grid capabilities. By integrating energy efficiency, distributed energy generation technologies, and demand flexibility into buildings, the state of the art in grid-interactive efficient buildings can be advanced. Such integration is feasible with the deployment of smart electrical load management strategies supported by sensor and actuator wireless networks that offer potential on the path toward Tactile Internet, Internet of Energy, smart urban mobility, net-zero energy buildings, and ultimately long-term sustainability and health.}
