abstract = {3D sand mould printing using binder jet technology can enable many technical improvements in casting practice, including part consolidation, design of parts to optimise the consumption of materials and hazardous chemicals, and on-demand and flexible size part manufacturing near the customer. Incorporating artificial intelligence in optimising the design of moulds, printing process parameters, and solidification processes may help automate a production facility and reduce labour time. Elimination of hazardous chemicals from industrial use may be a challenge. Therefore, an alternative technology to fuse the sand particles during printing or an environmentally friendlier alternative option for the binders and other consumables should be utilised with the 3D sand printing process. Properties of parts produced using 3D printed sand moulds have the potential to be better than the properties of parts produced using traditional casting due to this technology's benefits. This technology is an enabling technology for traditional casting processes rather than a competing technology. It is causing a paradigm shift in casting design because of the mould geometries achievable by using additive manufacturing to produce the sand mould. This paper reviews the first twenty years of research and challenges in developing 3D sand printing processes as an innovation for sustainable manufacturing.}

This review organizes the essential basics, major applications, and remaining challenges of machine learning in sustainable energies into two parts to accommodate the background knowledge and interests of both artificial intelligence and sustainable energy experts. First, the major applications of machine learning are divided into prediction, clustering, and optimization. For each category, the literature is categorized from new viewpoints, and research trends are highlighted to focus future research. In the second part, three primary machine learning–driven sustainability areas are introduced with respect to their abundance in the literature: multi-carrier energy systems, spatiotemporal analytics, and circular integration. For each engineering area, the contemporary progress is investigated in terms of a specific future research path. It is anticipated that the rapid application of machine learning tools will speed the development of sustainable energies during the next decade.}

abstract = {The exponential increase in data produced over the last two decades has revolutionized the way we collect, store, process, analyze, model, and interpret information to improve profitability. Manufacturing is no exception. However, Smart Manufacturing, the digital practice, organization, workforce, and infrastructure transformation for collection and deployment of data and models at scale and at all levels of manufacturing, is a complex, costly, and labor-intensive journey that is still seeing slow adoption. The Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), a national Manufacturing USA public-private partnership sponsored by the Department of Energy, is addressing this scaled use of data and modeling in manufacturing. CESMII has focused on how to collect and use operating data for numerous applications that improve productivity, precision, and performance of manufacturing operations from factory floor to supply chain using process simulation, predictive analytics, monitoring and control, and real-time optimization. Because contextualized data are key, CESMII has developed the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform (SMIP) to lower the barriers to the data that are needed to accelerate data-based model building, improve data visualization, and more quickly gain insights. Reusable, standards-based ways of doing data collection, ingestion, and contextualization are particularly important for scaling access and use of data. The SMIP uses a standards-based definition and construct for reusable information models called an SM Profile. When an SM Profile is used in conjunction with the SMIP, the SMIP ensures the availability of contextualized, operational data for model building. The present work demonstrates Smart Manufacturing and the application of the SMIP for building several data-centered models for the operation and control of an experimental electrochemical reactor that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to valuable liquid and gas chemicals, such as alcohols, olefins, and syngas. We describe how the SMIP plays a central role in more effective model building and we demonstrate how the electochemical reactor can be controlled and optimized for the desired products. Use of the SMIP involves the transmission of real-time sensor measurements to a cloud resource so that the operating data are available to all model building experts. The data collection and transmission process is fully automated to greatly reduce the need for manual manipulation of the data. Data-driven machine learning models are used for advanced real-time state estimation, real-time optimization, and model-based feedback control for the reactor. The application models are implemented as a system to monitor the data flow and control the electrochemical reactor with a single visualization interface. SM Profiles are used to demonstrate reusability of the information models for the reactor and the instrumentation. The application packages, algorithms, and user interfaces developed are cast as Docker images in a library to facilitate reusability of the application models.}

Based on current research, Lean production and Industry 4.0 strategies are promising in this regard. They argue to offer cost and time efficiency, labor productivity increase, and other benefits. In the literature, there are works on separate effects of Lean and Industry 4.0 on Sustainability, as well as high compatibility between Industry 4.0 and Lean, where one strategy comprehends the use of another. Only a few articles consider the integrated effect and mostly lack empirical validation. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on both separate and integrated effects of Lean and Industry 4.0 (Lean 4.0) on three pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social). Additionally, several sustainability indicators as differentiation factors are formed and presented as a checklist to assess the effect of Lean and Industry 4.0 concepts. The findings reveal that Lean and Industry 4.0 has a somewhat uncertain or twofold correlation with sustainability, where Lean 4.0 has a strong positive correlation. The results of the study can be used by researchers for another large-scale research that empirically validates the developed hypothesis and by managers in the strategy development and decision-making processes.

Specifically, we design a novel eNsemble federATed leArning for mobiLity InfErence (NATALIE) framework. The ensemble method combines the outputs from different DNN models learned via FL and shows an accuracy that surpasses comparable models reported in the literature. Extensive benchmarking experiments on open-access MTL Trajét and GeoLife GPS datasets demonstrate that the proposed inference model can achieve comparable accuracy in the identification of mode of travel without compromising privacy. The evaluation of the proposed model against non-i.i.d. data at varying sample sizes and different worker numbers shows improved performance.

abstract = {Service function chaining (SFC) is a trending paradigm and it has attracted considerable attention from both the industry and academia because of its potential to improve dynamicity and flexibility in service chain provisioning significantly. SFC makes it easier and more convenient to compose on-demand service chains customized for application-specific requirements. In addition to SFC, network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) are two other technology enablers that drive software-based service chain solutions. SFC leverages NFV for flexible deployment and for the placement of virtual resources and virtual network functions (VNFs); further, it employs SDN to provide traffic steering and network connectivity between the deployed VNF instances to form an application-specific service chain. Although SFC introduces many promising advantages, security is a major concern and a potential barrier for the widespread adoption of SFC technology. The integration of these technologies introduces a wide variety of security risks in the different levels of SFC stacks because SFC relies on NFV and SDN, and this results in a greater attack surface. Therefore, this survey aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of SFC from a security perspective. To this end, we examine the SFC architecture in detail, including the design principles and relationships between other functional components, to obtain a clear understanding of SFC. The significant enhancements achieved by adopting SFC are highlighted. Further, we exemplify its deployment in several realistic use cases. Based on the SFC layering model, we analyze security threats to identify all possible risk exposures and establish a layer-specific threat taxonomy. We then systematically analyze the existing defensive solutions and propose a set of security recommendations to secure an SFC-enabled domain. Our goal is to help network operators deploy cost-effective security hardening based on their specific requirements. Finally, several open research challenges and future directions of SFC are also discussed.}

abstract = {Automated vehicles (AVs) have received intense attention in academia and industry around the world in recent years, but the imminent introduction of AVs brings new challenges and opportunities for transportation networks and built environments. It is important to understand the potential infrastructure-related requirements of AVs and their impact on road infrastructure in order to assess the readiness of the existing road network and prepare plans for future roads. This paper seeks to address what the implications of automated vehicles will likely be for the road infrastructure based on a comprehensive literature review. To investigate this issue, two broad questions were framed: What are the potential effects of AVs on physical road infrastructure; and What do AVs require from road infrastructure for safe driving. A total of thirteen key topics around infrastructure have been identified from the existing literature regarding vehicle automation that needs to be considered during either the initial phase of deployment or transition to full automation. In the light of the identified topics, the paper presents potential changes and challenges, making recommendations for future research directions to ensure a safe and efficient operation.}

A number of previous works showed significant progress on security effectiveness evaluation for MTD mechanisms. While, a lesser amount of studies considered the impact of running MTD mechanisms on system dependability metrics, exposing a critical missing on the comprehension of pros and cons of MTD mechanisms in terms of security and dependability. In this paper, we present comprehensive modelling and analysis of time-based switch-over MTD strategies complying with IP shuffling techniques deployed in a Software Defined Network (SDN) using stochastic reward net (SRN). To investigate the impact of MTD strategies along with system availability on service performance metrics, we propose performability SRN models for various switch-over MTD strategies. The modelled behaviours of the switch-over MTD strategies are based on the integration of service management policies (drop/accept) with time-based switch-over policies (zero-time, fixed-time, and variable-time waiting policies) Critical performability metrics are comprehensively evaluated, including (i) system availability, downtime minutes, and Capacity-oriented Availability (COA) of a service, (ii) service throughput, (iii) response time of a job, (iv) average utilization of a server, (v) number of lost jobs, and (vi) operational cost (power consumption and business profit loss). The analysis results reveal sophisticated operational system behaviours and the impact of MTD strategies on system performability metrics. This study can help design and plan the development and adoption of MTD strategies in practice regarding the trade-offs between security and performability assurance.}

This paper, to support automated driving systems (assisted, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles), introduces a cognitive layer called Associated Reality to enhance the involved information, knowledge and communication processes. The architecture defined includes an augmented Local Dynamic Map, with complementary layers, and an augmented Graph Database, with complementary semantic–cognitive relations, for the considered purpose, in cooperative human–machine and machine–machine systems. Virtual augmented landmarks are defined to improve the connectivity and intelligence of the involved spatial-information systems. Different structure landmarks and sequence landmarks (which includes regular, repetitive and periodic landmarks) are defined, categorized and used in diverse visual localization and mapping scenarios, for autonomous driving. In this paper, it is also shown, as a proof-of-concept for vehicle localization and mapping in road tunnels, the visual detection of different sequences of periodic luminaires, using YOLO v3 for the corresponding LED lights detection, or a specific alternative procedure developed with very low computational cost.}

This study explores Industry 4.0 in the Australian context, where manufacturing is dominated by smaller firms servicing the domestic market. We interviewed 20 advanced Australian manufacturers from diverse fields, capturing detailed descriptions of the Industry 4.0 implementation process. We compared the themes that emerged from their descriptions with the factors typically assessed in Industry 4.0 frameworks to draw out differences in emphasis. Consistent with these frameworks, Australian manufacturers were focused on using Industry 4.0 technologies to automate the capture, integration and analysis of data. To enable this activity, they were reorganising workforce roles and developing new skill sets. Knowledge sharing and collaborations within and across the organisation were seen to be especially important for small Australian manufacturers (with limited funding for technology investment and research and development) to maintain global competitiveness. However, while most Industry 4.0 frameworks describe supply chain applications, the development of smart products and services, and the need to adopt a strategy-led approach, relatively few participants spoke about these opportunities. Even fewer addressed the need for improved governance, standards and data security in the context of Industry 4.0. We argue that these gaps are best addressed through government policy and investment focusing beyond manufacturers, to support Industry 4.0 uplift across key domestic supply chains.}

However, the changes coming over the next few years have significant potential for even bigger step changes. Gartner (2016) published an extensive report on the opportunities for digitalization of upstream O&G. The report covered the projected operator impact for drilling and wells, field development, and production and operations. In the report, Exxon Mobil's chief computational scientist is quoted as saying, the “oil patch's digital transformation will be comparable to horizontal drilling's tech revolution” (Endress, 2017) (which, of course, was the game-changing technology that enabled the shale gas revolution, among other major industry achievements). Furthermore, the report states that “…he predicts the digitalization of oilfield equipment and operations will continue for the foreseeable future, due to future competitive advantages and untold economic value” (Endress, 2017). This final chapter highlights a few of the exciting technologies that are in development or are being envisioned for the digital oil field (DOF) of the future.}

A model capable of facilitating the use of construction information in the proposed framework was developed to implement the proposed framework into practice. Combining the BIM model within the framework provides all project stakeholders with prerequisite information needed for a building's configuration. This collaborative process utilises an algorithmic composition in which the current assembly information in both the BIM model and framework is used as a controlling factor in the configuration process. The parametric environment of Revit and the algorithmic environment of the Dynamo plugin were used to realise the proposed framework (as a proof of concept).}

abstract = {The digitalization of agricultural production and the use of digital data are fundamentally transforming processes, products, and services of the agro-food systems. Digitalization improves efficiency and facilitates sophisticated farm management, thus increasing productivity, efficacy, and profitability. At the same time, it promises many opportunities for a more sustainable and, especially, more ecological and cleaner agricultural production. However, with it comes the potential for a number of unintended side effects and risks that may increase the vulnerability of agricultural production and have, thus far, received scant scientific and societal attention. This article presents the results of a two-year transdisciplinary process that aimed to identify unintended side-effects (short “unseens”) and perceived risks of digitalization in German agriculture. Results base on a triangulation of knowledge integration from the transdisciplinary group process involving twelve representatives from science and practice and an ethnographic qualitative meta-analysis. The findings have shown that, despite digitalization's numerous promises for a more ecological and resource efficient agricultural production, a broad range of risks was perceived by some key stakeholders involved. These risks were anticipated to be caused by unintended negative and uncertain side effects on agro-ecological and social systems. Data rights, the restructuring of the value chain with new market concentrations, power structures and dependencies, changing knowledge requirements for farmers (lacking “digital literacy”), and information asymmetries that may cause potentially negative effects on food security were identified as causal factors. Based on these results, we co-developed socially robust orientations (SoROs) for coping with resulting risks and vulnerabilities. We argue that these SoROs provide perspectives on how anticipated knowledge can be turned into responsible action within the RRI (responsible research and innovation) framework. Finally, with regard to the preventive and anticipatory paradigm of “cleaner production”, our transdisciplinary methodology shows a way to adaptively govern the highly complex socio-technological transitions of digitalization in agriculture in the sense of a sustainability-oriented transformation.}

This chapter discusses how most of these issues can be addressed through intelligent use of real-time operating data continuously collected from their production facilities. It advocates the use of a data-driven strategy to optimize operational efficiency and maintenance and enable business personnel to quickly and easily take corrective action when abnormal conditions occur. By taking corrective actions in real time, unnecessary costs can be avoided, bottom line profitability is increased, employee safety is maintained, and responsible environmental stewardship is achieved. The strategy uses real-time data infrastructure software as the integration layer between production process control systems (operational technology), business systems, and advanced offline analytics (information technology).}

It provides a fine-grained matching service for users. However, users enjoy these benefits at the cost of leaking personal multi-dimensional data. The existing social metaverse-based intelligent identification of close friends privacy protection models typically use centralized mechanisms. This will limit users’ control over their data and make them vulnerable to privacy leakage and data misuse. To address these problems, this paper proposes a traceable and revocable decentralized multi-authority privacy protection scheme (TRDM) for social metaverse. The scheme establishes multiple authority centers based on users’ multi-dimensional data, overcoming single point of failure and performance bottlenecks. In addition, TRDM partially hides access policies and supports multi-dimensional attribute access control in social metaverse environment. By introducing leaf node values of binary trees, TRDM achieves the traceability and completes the revocation of malicious users by updating part of the ciphertext. Security analysis and experiments show that TRDM satisfies the requirement of static security under the random prediction model and has better performance in the revocation of malicious users.}

The relevant aspects of pandemics risk management have been first identified and mapped; then, the studies reviewed have been analysed with the aim of evaluating their suitability of being applied to sanitary crises. In carrying out this review of the literature, the study moves from previous, more general, reviews about risk management and updates them, starting from the lines of research that have been covered in recent years and evaluating their consistency with future research directions emerging also as a consequence of the pandemic crisis. Gaps and limitations of the existing models are identified and future research directions for pandemics risk management are suggested.}

abstract = {Serverless computing is the most innovative and affordable cloud service model that improves three strategic business objectives: flexibility, efficiency, and innovation. Compared to monolithic applications, serverless computing applications scale better as the applications are further broken down into small building blocks of functions. Resources are assigned per function and can scale up as function requests increase. Hence, serverless computing has been increasingly employed in high-impact areas such as banking and health care. An issue affecting serverless computing’s performance is cold-start — the delays in assigning resources for function execution. Such delays can violate the Service Level Agreements especially those of time-sensitive applications. Current cold-start management policies operate in silos with narrow focuses on function, application, runtime, or infrastructure levels. Such policies do not incorporate higher-level requirements like those in the Service Level Agreements. Additionally, operating in silos does not follow the principle of continuous feedback loops among management policies at different system levels, which is essential for AI-driven self-adaptive future computing systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel 2-prong cold-start management policy that allows feedback loops with other higher management policies and orchestrates lower-level cold-start optimization policies. The main policy driver is the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model that can predict function instance arrivals from 5 to 15 min into the future. Evaluation strategies were proposed for both the TCN model and the management policy. Evaluation results show that the TCN model performs reliably across two trace datasets from leading serverless computing providers. Notably, the proposed cold-start policy evaluation plan allows organizations to realistically evaluate their cold-start management in ways that have never been done before.}

abstract = {The assurance case arguments are created to demonstrate acceptable system safety and/or security. In this regard, a series of propositions expressed by natural language statements (claims) are broken down into sub-claims representing a logical chain of reasoning until the corresponding evidence is obtained. The review and update of assurance arguments for aligning with the process and product counterparts used for their construction are essential tasks. These tasks are perceived as challenging but can be efficiently supported by using Natural Language Processing (NLP). To date, however, the published studies on assurance cases have not leveraged the NLP. Accordingly, this paper presents our NLP-based assurance framework called ATTEST. At first, the text preprocessing is carried out by using NLP tasks. The rules are created, in which both syntactic and semantic features are captured. The former is captured by using NLP tasks, while the latter is captured by the internal structure of models as well as the mappings across them. The created rules are triggered for argument comprehension, well-formedness, sufficiency checks, and identifying defeaters and counter-evidence selection. Besides the process, product, and assurance case models produced during the design and development phase, the operational data is gathered from the configured simulation environments and used for identifying problems as well as the measures for resolving them. Finally, the affected parts of assurance case models are highlighted and the underlying reasoning for their adaptation is presented. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated by reviewing and updating assurance cases constructed for vehicular Accelerator Control System (ACS) with Electronic Throttle Control (ETC).}

A first order disruption is a localized change, within a market or industry. A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.}

abstract = {Objective
Despite current standardization actions towards the unification between European Union (EU) countries, there is still much work to do. In this context, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of the EU concerning emergency situations, specifically in cross-border, cross-hierarchical, and cross-sectorial emergencies, as well as the analysis of emergent opportunities for improvement. The final goal of this analysis is to serve as an initial step for pre-standardizing these opportunities.
Materials and methods
This work, performed in the context of the EU H2020 VALKYRIES project, first analyzed existing gaps from three dimensions: technological, procedural, collaboration, and training. Each gap was obtained from the literature, professional experience within VALKYRIES, or a consultation process on EU emergency agencies. This research subsequently obtained a list of opportunities from these limitations, aggregating those opportunities with similarities to ease their study. Then, this work prioritized the opportunities based on their feasibility and positive impact, performing an additional consultation process to EU emergencies for validation. Finally, this investigation provided a roadmap for pre-standardization for the five top-ranked opportunities per dimension.
Results
This paper presents a set of 303 gaps and 255 opportunities across technological, procedural, collaboration, and training dimensions. After clustering the opportunities, this work provides a final set of 82 meta opportunities for improving emergency actions in the EU, prioritized based on their feasibility for adoption and positive impact. Finally, this work documents the roadmaps for three top-ranked opportunities for conciseness.
Conclusion
This publication highlights the limitations and opportunities in the EU concerning emergency agencies and, more specifically, those existing in cross-border and multi-casualty incidents. This work concludes that there is still room for improvement despite the current measures toward harmonization and standardization.}

abstract = {With the growing complexity of modern vehicles in the digital era, ensuring the reliability of vehicle system becomes a challenge that needs a responsive framework to monitor and alert the unhealthy states. An unhealthy state refers to a timestamp in which vehicle operates off the expected range of performance. Being able to detect an unhealthy state early not only helps to identify imminent performance failures but also indicates the necessity of deploying preventive maintenance. It is almost impossible to be aware of an imminent failure without modeling the behavior of various subsystems of vehicle. This study proposes a behavior modeling and anomaly detection approach to accurately analyze the operation of various vehicle subsystems and trigger early alerts of unhealthy states. We propose a Multi-Layer Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that is integrated with an Autoencoder architecture (ML-LSTMAE) to monitor and predict the operation of different subsystems of vehicle. Modern vehicles involve various subsystems with respective sensors that record various operating signals. The proposed model leverages multivariate time series data sequences that are recorded by different sensors to train an encoding–decoding scheme. We use One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to analyze the reconstruction errors and build a support boundary. Then, the trained support boundary evaluates the prediction errors in test data to distinguish the healthy and unhealthy states of vehicle. We validate the efficiency of the proposed behavior modeling and anomaly detection approaches via evaluating two case study problems. First, a case study of an operating vehicle data that consists of 15 months time series records of 101 data channels. Second, a NASA bearing case study data that includes 20,110,378 observational records of four bearings time series sequences. The results of both case studies confirm the high accuracy of the proposed ML-LSTMAE network for learning the latent behavior of different operating subsystems. Moreover, the proposed OCSVM algorithm classifies the healthy and unhealthy states in both case studies, precisely.}

Thus, this paper aims to explore the nature of blockchain technology under varying conditions for consumer benefits. Academic and press articles followed by interviews from industry experts were used to explore the nature of blockchain technology (BCT) for the hospitality and tourism sector (HTS). A hybrid research methodology is proposed to investigate the criticality of factors, their hierarchical model, and cause & effect relationships. 35 Employees from two geographies, namely India (N=17) and Netherlands (N=18) in hospitality and tourism firms, were interviewed. In the next step, the expert opinions were collected using the Analytic hierarchy process - Interpretive Structural Modeling- Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (AHP-ISM-DEMATEL) technique. A forward-looking approach was adopted by considering the implications of barriers and drivers on the adoption of BCT and thereby benefiting HTS. The results suggest that ‘low cost’ and ‘risk management’ are the key drivers with driving power of 1 and 10 in Indian and the Netherlands, respectively. They are placed at I and VI hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group. ‘Lack of Government Regulation/ Policy’ and ‘Market Uncertainty’ are the critical barriers with driving power 9 and 10 in the Indian and Netherlands context, respectively. They are placed at V and III hierarchy levels and fall under the cause effect group.}

Among the technological portfolio enabling this revolution, the late literature has capitalized on the potential of data analytics for improving the production cycle at different stages, from resource provisioning to planning, delivery and storage. However, such a promising role of data analytics has been so far explored without a proper, quantitative inspection of the cost-improvement trade-off, nor has the process of acquiring sensors and extracting valuable information from their captured data formalized in a series of methodological steps. This paper introduces the Analyze, Sense, Preprocess, Predict, Implement and Deploy (ASPPID) methodology, an iterative decision workflow that spans from the acquisition of sensing equipment to the quantitative assessment of the contribution of their captured data to enhance the production step under focus. By placing the data scientist at the core of the workflow, this methodology helps improvement teams make informed decisions about which parts of the process need to be sensed, and how to exploit this information towards a verifiable improvement of the production cycle. The implementation of this methodology is exemplified in a real use case within the automotive industry, where the detection of defects in an annealing process can be modeled as a classification problem over a highly imbalanced dataset. Results obtained after applying the proposed ASPPID methodology show that the scrap ratio is reduced by sensing the correct part of the process at minimal investment costs, thus highlighting the crucial role of the data scientist in the management team of manufacturing plants.}

It furthermore provides solutions for handling those problems. Second, following Finger and Jaag 2015, the reshaping of the maritime supply chain is discussed from the industry, policy, and management perspectives. Last, some scenarios of how the industry should evolve from partner collaboration (one-to-one collaboration) to a maritime supply network (many-to-many collaboration) are discussed.

abstract = {Modern utility grid is experiencing a transition from conservative centralized generation structure to a more distributed and decentralized structure. To achieve this transition, decentralized energy sources and loads must be seamlessly integrated and isolated from main grid structure. Realization of one such approach is termed as “Microgrid”. Microgrids (MGs) are a source of clean, efficient, and an economical way to integrating renewable energy sources and loads to the main grid. Higher penetration levels of MG would lead to significant perturbations with time periods being lower than conventional dynamic responses. This may pose problems of stable operation for the entire utility grid. For addressing this problem, this paper gives an in-depth literature review on the different control structure of MGs. As control dynamics required vary significantly, depending upon the integrated source, connected loads and ratings of the MG, it is important to understand the different structures of MG. Thus, categorization of MG based on different criteria such as distributed energy resources (DERs), type of distribution systems, modes of operation, and types of communication links used are first studied. As modern control structures are layered to achieve dynamic responses at different time constants, hierarchical controls are implemented. To address this concern, different levels of hierarchical controls are also discussed along with the control strategies of integrating various renewable energy resources in MGs. Different methods of controls are analyzed and assessed in each category and the major issues faced in the current infrastructure are noted. As the grid is moving towards optimal design of microgrid structures this manuscript reviews a number of optimization techniques along with their benefits and drawbacks.}

The promises and realities of digital innovation have come to suffuse everything from government to finance, art to medicine, astronomy to cities, politics to warfare—and from genetics to reality itself. This astonishing advance presents enormous opportunities and risks. It carries with it great responsibilities. Digital systems augmenting physical space, buildings, and cities occupy a special place in the wider evolutionary discourse about advanced technology. Elsevier's two Intelligent Environments books edited by Peter Droege span a quarter of a century across this genre. This second volume goes a step further than the first and asks: how does civilization approach thinking systems, and more specifically intelligent spatial models, design methods, and support structures that are designed or applied for spatial sustainability, in ways that could even counteract current challenges to terrestrial habitability? The result of this quest is useful, practical, and informative: it opens a door to what must now become a rapidly growing and overarching existential focus. This book presents a range of practical, typical, systemic but also unusual and even sublime ideas and initiatives to regenerate a sustainable world freed from the dogma of development without purpose. These are visible in endeavors as diverse as the planned guidance of industrial change across regions, currency innovation, infrastructure architecture, network protocols of energy transaction, geodesign, net-positive design, remote work, integrated transport—or notions of artificial intelligence in understanding our most immediate spatial setting: the human body.}

However, an understanding of hierarchical concepts, as they exist at present, can help to clarify some of many possible trade-offs in the control and operation of electric power systems. By the middle of the 21st century, we should expect drastic changes in the appearance of the energy sector. These changes are related not only to the processes that are intrinsic to the energy sector (intensive development of energy technologies, a qualitative shift in the scale of adoption of intelligent information and communication technologies and means of control of energy facilities and systems), but also to a fundamental change in the paradigm of development and operation of energy systems as client-oriented infrastructure systems that provide reliable and efficient services to industries and the community. The complexity of energy systems, their interaction and interdependence, the complexity of substantiating the expansion of these systems as stand-alone systems and as part of the energy sector as well as integrated energy systems, the complexity of the processes that take place in energy systems - all this predetermines the relevance of the application of hierarchical modeling to substantiating the development and management of the operation of energy systems.}

abstract = {This study draws on an extensive survey and interview data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents were executives of industrials firms whose factories, warehouses, and headquarters are located in Northern Italy. This is undoubtedly the European region first and most extensively affected by the pandemic, and the government implemented radical lockdown measures, banning nonessential travel and mandating the shutdown of all nonessential businesses. Several major effects on both product and service businesses are highlighted, including the disruption of field-service operations and supply networks. This study also highlights the increased importance of servitization business models and the acceleration of digital transformation and advanced services. To help firms navigate through the crisis and be better positioned after the pandemic, the authors present a four-stage crisis management model (calamity, quick & dirty, restart, and adapt), which provides insights and critical actions that should be taken to cope with the expected short and long-term implications of the crisis. Finally, this study discusses how servitization can enhance resilience for future crises—providing a set of indicators on the presumed role of, and impact on, service operations in relation to what executives expect to be the “next normal.”}

abstract = {Wearable sensing is a rapidly expanding research area with significant future potential and impact, encompassing lifestyle, sports & fitness and healthcare applications. The target of the next generation of wearable technologies is to be energy efficient, accurate, intelligent and integrate seamlessly with the body as a second skin. Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs), which use static charging and electrostatic induction to convert body movements into electrical pulses, are envisioned as a key addition to next generation wearables due to their self-powered sensing and energy harvesting capabilities. TENGs offer high instantaneous electrical outputs, low cost, flexibility and comfort, presenting the potential for autonomous and maintenance free operation of wearable sensing applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the cutting-edge developments in TENG based wearable sensing systems. Herein, we present a holistic system level assessment where we analyse the sensing and power generation functions of the TENGs as well as the related power management, signal acquisition, decision making, connectivity and integration processes. The drawbacks and the most critical challenges of the existing technology are discussed, with perspectives on potential routes to overcome them.}
