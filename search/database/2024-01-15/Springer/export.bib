            Most definitions of the Internet of Things (IoT) take a technology perspective, referring to connected devices exchanging data with each other and with higher levels, establishing autonomously operating systems. From a business perspective, IoT can be regarded as a business transformation, driving commoditization or even threatening conventional businesses, providing opportunities for product and process improvements and opening perspectives for services business or entirely new businesses based on data acquired by IoT. While the development of the Internet of Things resembles in many aspects the characteristics of for example semiconductor and IT platforms, there are some essential differences, mainly in scale and scope, that make the kickstart of a successful IoT more complex. This paper addresses key elements of a successful deployment of IoT and also key roles for IT professionals in IoT.},

            The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) promises productivity gains in industrial practice. While IT technology offers a variety of technological advances, plant owners strive for stability and robustness of the production process. To overcome this tension field, we propose a set of 16 requirements for the development of industrial AI solutions to foster i) the adaptation process, ii) support the solution engineering and iii) ease the embedding into the existing system landscape while respecting iv) safety aspects to build up v) trust into industrial AI solutions. The proposed requirements can guide industrial stakeholders to focus on the right solution approach for specific production challenges and support them in voicing their own needs towards novel AI solutions. This will help AI developers to speed up time-to-market as well as to increase market acceptance of industrial AI solutions. Overall, specifying requirements on industrial AI will foster the acceptance and utilization rates of AI solutions in industrial practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            According to contemporary challenges of digital evolution in management and maintenance of construction processes, the present study aims at defining valuable strategies for building management optimization. As buildings’ and infrastructures’ Digital Twins (DT) are directly connected to physical environment through the Internet of Things (IoT), asset management and control processes can be radically transformed. The proposed DT framework connects building information model (BIM) three-dimensional objects to information about the planned maintenance of components, supplying system’s self-learning capabilities through input data coming from Building Management Systems (BMSs), ticketing, as well as maintenance activities’ data flow both as-needed or unexpected. The concept of real-time acquisition and data processing set the basis for the proposed system architecture, allowing to perform analysis and evaluate alternative scenarios promptly responding to unexpected events with a higher accuracy over time. Moreover, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) allows the development of maintenance predictive capabilities, optimizing decision-making processes and implementing strategies based on the performed analysis, configuring a scalable approach useful for different scenarios. The proposed approach is related to the evolution from reactive to proactive strategies based on Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) for Building and Facility Management, providing actionable solutions through operational, monitoring and maintenance data. Through the integration of BIM data with information systems, BMS, IoT and machine learning, the optimization and real-time automation of maintenance activities are performed, radically reducing failures and systems’ breakdowns. Therefore, integrating different technologies in a virtual environment allows to define data-driven predictive models supporting Building Managers in decision-making processes improving efficiency over time and moving from reactive to proactive approaches.},

            The conference's Innovation session gathered more than 20 papers ranging from the digitization of the construction world to the digital twin of complex infrastructure such as port areas. The common denominator of the presentations was the methodological search for the best combination of physical reality and digital replication, always putting the functionality and operability of the built environment at the center of the study. In fact, the contributions, although coming from very different research realities, clearly highlighted the inescapable path toward the integration of the digital world in the AECO sector.},

            The digital transformation process is creating a system of new digital technologies that will give rise to an autonomous ecosystem capable of predicting and determining what will happen in the physical world. The digital twin seen as a moment of creation of a self-named digital model (digital alter ego) and guided in its design by an artificial intelligence can be a source of concern, questioning the central role of the person and of his intelligence in the creative process. The most important problems are: Artificial intelligence capacity to extend its capabilities in a unpredictable way and the inability to understand how artificial intelligence builds its solutions. After hinting at the roots of this problems, we will introduce co-creation as a new way of conceiving the collaboration between the human being and artificial intelligence. Co-creation requires to solve the problems outlined above and this could perhaps define new frontiers of creativity.},

            Industry 4.0 is affecting almost every area of the industry, and as a result of its effects, systems, technologies, and the way information is processed are being transformed. Its typical feature is transmission of information in the system environment provided by the Internet of Things. All information should be stored and shared through cloud computing. As a result, access to information should be unrestricted. This chapter is focused on Computational Intelligence (CI) in the context of Industry 4.0. Each subchapter provides fundamentals of some paradigms, followed by the use of CI in the concrete paradigm. The ending part of the chapter is focused on connecting theory and practice in a case study, which lists industrial parts recognition by convolutional neural networks for assisted assembly.},

            In this chapter, we explore after 10 years of Industry 4.0 the status of the application in manufacturing companies and especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Based on literature and previously conducted research we present guidelines and a modular framework for implementing smart manufacturing in SMEs. In addition, a stage model is illustrated to support SMEs in breaking down the framework from a design level to an implementation and operational level. Finally, an outlook is given on the future challenges that SMEs will face in the coming years when they want to reach the next level of Industry 4.0 in their own company.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The way humans work is constantly changing. This has always been the case, especially in dynamic environments. In the context of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), collaborative platforms, accelerated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, give rise to new automation opportunities of complex and previously labor-intensive tasks, while also creating new business models for multiple stakeholders.
            Due to accelerated product innovation, the manufacturing industry needs to be able to generate solutions in a timely manner and quickly move them into production according to customer expectations. Today, machines in an Industry 4.0 factory are collaboratively connected. Such a development requires the application of advanced predictive tools that can systematically transform requirements and data into information and ultimately knowledge to manage uncertainties and make informed ad hoc decisions. In this context, a production system needs to perform rapid self-reconfiguration in response to different product characteristics to achieve an agile transition to the new manufacturing processes. However, a large number of non-standardized device interfaces and communication protocols are currently existing on the shop floor, which leads to high time and capital costs. Furthermore, this leads to insufficient reliability in the configuration of the production system, so that the requirements for customization and rapid adaptation cannot be met. In addition, there is also a large knowledge gap in the academic field of self-configurable intelligent production systems using collaborative engineering and IoT platforms.
            Therefore, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT, Germany) and Tongji University (Shanghai, People´s Republic of China) have proposed the collaborative “Construction, Reference Implementation and Verification Platform of Reconfigurable Intelligent Production Systems” and the “Factory Automation Platform”, which meets the challenges of self-configuration, agile response, accumulation of domain knowledge and services, intelligent operation and maintenance of production systems.},

            This paper presents a summary of mechanisms for the evolution of artificial intelligence in ‘internet of things’ networks. Firstly, the paper investigates how the use of new technologies in industrial systems improves organisational resilience supporting both a technical and human level. Secondly, the paper reports empirical results that correlate academic literature with Industry 4.0 interdependencies between edge components to both external and internal services and systems. The novelty of the paper is a new approach for creating a virtual representation operating as a real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process (i.e., digital twin) outlined in a conceptual diagram. The methodology applied in this paper resembled a grounded theory analysis of complex interconnected and coupled systems. By connecting the human–computer interactions in different information knowledge management systems, this paper presents a summary of mechanisms for the evolution of artificial intelligence in internet of things networks.},

            Cyber-physical systems (CPS) offer great potential for the digital transformation of industrial value creation in the context of Industry 4.0. They unify and integrate several technological approaches, including big data analysis and artificial intelligence, enhancing real-time monitoring and control of manufacturing processes. An extensive knowledge base formed by various disciplines, including information systems, engineering, and computer science, already exists for CPS. However, this knowledge has not been holistically captured and structured to date. To address this research gap, this study conducts a large-scale literature review of 2365 papers representing the current state of the research and then develops a novel categorization on industrial CPS with 10 sections, 32 areas, and 246 fields. The categorization is presented in hierarchical graphical form and can also be utilized as a web tool. To conclude, a perspective on future research needs and potentials to enhance Industry 4.0 in both research and practice are offered.},

            Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) serves as an interdisciplinary effort that incorporates cyber vector as well as physical vector. The latter can generate exponentially growing amounts of data. How to process CPS big data systematically and efficiently is the key to the breakthrough of offering prospective and personalized services for each individual user and entity involved. In recent years, much research has been proactively conducted on advancing specific scenario or algorithm. However, few surveys value their integration. For good measure, the synthesis remains a fundamental challenge. Subsequently, we fill the gap in the literature by constructing cloud computing, fog computing and edge computing as a whole to inspire on new architectures and cross utilizations. Moreover, bringing the enthusiasm of traditionally solitude entities into play is crucial. In this exploratory study, we examine definitions of CPS as well as the three aforementioned computing paradigms and then shed new light on comprehensively established frameworks. We also survey on the application level of Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing in CPS respectively and dive into diversified algorithms and strategies to embed big data applications into a more intelligent and convenient society with current deficiencies and future research directions followed.},

            Current food system evolved in a great degree because of the development of processing and food engineering technologies: people learned to bake bread long before the advent of agriculture; salting and smoking supported nomad lifestyles; canning allowed for longer military marches; etc. Food processing technologies went through evolution and significant optimization and currently rely on minor fraction of energy comparing with initial prototypes. Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper presents a method that utilizes graph theory and state modelling algorithms to perform automatic complexity analysis of the architecture of cyber-physical systems (CPS). It describes cyber physical systems risk assessment (CPSRA), a tool to provide automatic decision support for enhancing the overall resilience of CPS architectures often used in critical infrastructures. CPRSA is built to enhance industrial risk assessment and improve the resilience of CPS architecture against malicious attacks on the cyber domain that can affect industrial processes, which is critical in a distributed cyber environment. Such attacks often compromise execution states on physical components and lead to hazards or even disasters through plant malfunction. CPSRA is tested against a real-world testbed model of a large SCADA system that is infused with real-world CVE vulnerabilities in some of its components. The tool creates an isomorphic graph of the CPS process model and uses graph algorithms and network analytics on the model to test cyber-attacks and evaluate attack resilience aspects. The tool’s output is then used to pinpoint high-complexity components in terms of influence on the overall CPS architecture and suggest mitigation points for security measure implementation while considering every potential subattack path and subliminal path on the model’s attack graph. The paper complements standardized assessment reports and contributes to automatic architecture assessment for critical infrastructure environments and can be used as the basis to model dependencies and threat propagation in larger digital twins, a need outlined in major NIST publications concerning the security of industrial systems that was previously done manually, without automatic insight into state and vulnerability influences.},

            Urban Internet of Things (IoT) is in an early speculative phase. Often linked to the smart city movement, it provides a way of sensing and collecting data—environmental, societal, and transitional—both automatically, remotely, and with increasing levels of spatial and temporal detail. From city-wide data collection down to the scale of individual buildings and rooms, this chapter details the technology behind the rise of IoT in urban areas and explores the challenges (societal and technical) behind city-wide deployments. Drawing from a series of deployments at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, it details the challenges and opportunities for mass data collection. Widening out the view, it looks at what is becoming known as “the humble lamp post” in Urban IoT fields to detail the potential of Urban IoT with the objects that already form part of the urban fabric. Finally, it examines the potential of Urban IoT for input into urban modeling and how we are on the edge of a shift in the collection, analysis, and communication of urban data.},

            The existing logistics practices frequently lack the ability to effectively handle disruptions. Recent research called for dynamic, digital-driven approaches that can help prioritise allocation of logistics resources to design more adaptive and sustainable logistics networks. The purpose of this study is to explore inter-dependencies between physical and digital assets to examine how cyber-physical systems could enable interoperability in logistics networks. The paper provides an overview of the existing literature on cyber-physical applications in logistics and proposes a conceptual model of a Cloud Material Handling System. The model allows leveraging the use of digital technologies to capture and process real-time information about a logistics network with the aim to dynamically allocate material handling resources and promote asset and infrastructure sharing. The model describes how cloud computing, machine learning and real-time information can be utilised to dynamically allocate material handling resources to product flows. The adoption of the proposed model can increase efficiency, resilience and sustainability of logistics practices. Finally, the paper offers several promising research avenues for extending this work.},

            Most definitions of the Internet of Things (IoT) take a technology perspective, referring to connected devices exchanging data with each other and with higher levels, establishing autonomously operating systems. From a business perspective, IoT can be regarded as a business transformation, driving commoditization or even threatening conventional businesses, providing opportunities for product and process improvements and opening perspectives for services business or entirely new businesses based on data acquired by IoT. While the development of the Internet of Things resembles in many aspects the characteristics of for example semiconductor and IT platforms, there are some essential differences, mainly in scale and scope, that make the kickstart of a successful IoT more complex. This paper addresses key elements of a successful deployment of IoT and also key roles for IT professionals in IoT.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Future construction projects will need the implementation of industry 4.0 and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. The construction sector has, however, falling behind other industries in the application of these technologies and is currently facing considerable challenges. One of the industries that lag behind in the use of new innovative technological tools is the construction industry. This study reviews the research work in industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things as they relate to construction and examines key Ghana-based construction professionals and firms to ascertain their level of understanding of these emerging innovative technologies, including the challenges and benefits associated with their implementation. An extensive review of pertinent literature was done to help identify the important paradigms and variables which were cautiously tested. Adopting a quantitative research approach, the attained variables were used to design into a close-ended questionnaire. The sample frame was a survey of people from 154 construction experts and researchers with good standing by using the purposive sampling. Relative importance index (RII) analysis was used to analyzed the data. It was discovered from the findings that smart construction was the most popular industry 4.0 technology in the Ghanaian construction industry. The most important benefit of these technologies is that they will add sustainable policy requirements to tendering, with the most pressing technology being the lack of talent and skills in using industry 4.0 and IoT technologies. The scope of this research is based on the questionnaire survey, proving a sustainable pathway to the construction industry community, which creates its own significance by including key stakeholders and those affected by these technologies.},

However, despite the increased push towards “human-centric” IoT, it is still poorly understood what “human-centric” actually means in this context, how it is interpreted and embedded into the design, by whom, and for which purposes. To address these questions, we conducted a systematic literature review (N = 84) on the theory, principles, and design requirements of human-centric IoT. A key observation is that, despite the recent increase in research on humane perspectives for IoT, “human-centredness” often still seems to be used primarily as a label and overarching paradigm, not leading to a profound change in the underlying practices. We found no shared understanding of what “human-centric” implies in this context or common agreement on which principles human-centric IoT should be built upon. Furthermore, our analysis confirmed the predominance of technology-oriented fields, with a traditional approach towards user involvement and limited involvement of other disciplines. Overall, our findings point towards an apparent discrepancy between how contributions are positioned and framed (“human-centric”), the practices and assumptions they are based on, and their actual impact and ability to orient existing efforts towards genuine human-centric outcomes and key values. Based on the results, we formulate directions for future research aimed at building a more human-centric and empowering IoT.},

            The Internet of Things technology offers convenience and innovation in areas such as smart homes and smart cities. Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12\% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms. We propose an IoT Cybersecurity Communication Scorecard to help organizations benchmark the density and sentiment of their corporate communications regarding security against their specific industry.},

            Industrial revolutions (IRs) are mostly associated with how transformations regarding the operations of an enterprise affect said enterprise’s manufacturing systems. However, the impact of these transformations exceeds the production systems themselves; rather, they affect the entire value chain, from the product design and development process (PDDP) through manufacturing and supply-chain management to marketing and disposal. As the new PDDP to a large extent defines the value chain for a company, the challenge lies in ensuring that the designed product will help the company fully benefit from the IRs. By analysing the 4th IR, the authors reveal that few publications shed light on this aspect. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to establish features and properties that will shape the PDDP throughout the 4th IR and into a smart design engineering. To accomplish this, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature, which provides ten findings. These findings are then analysed by 11 specialists both from academia and the industry, and the findings’ relations to the 4th IR and their impact on the product development process is discussed. By establishing these findings, this paper provides a platform for the understanding of what could potentially shape smart design engineering and its design-related activities.},

            Industry 4.0 aims to transform chemical and biochemical processes into intelligent systems via the integration of digital components with the actual physical units involved. This process can be thought of as addition of a central nervous system with a sensing and control monitoring of components and regulating the performance of the individual physical assets (processes, units, etc.) involved. Established technologies central to the digital integrating components are smart sensing, mobile communication, Internet of Things, modelling and simulation, advanced data processing, storage and analysis, advanced process control, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud computing, and virtual and augmented reality. An essential element to this transformation is the exploitation of large amounts of historical process data and large volumes of data generated in real-time by smart sensors widely used in industry. Exploitation of the information contained in these data requires the use of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies integrated with more traditional modelling techniques. The purpose of this paper is twofold: a) to present the state-of-the-art of the aforementioned technologies, and b) to present a strategic plan for their integration toward the goal of an autonomous smart plant capable of self-adaption and self-regulation for short- and long-term production management.},

            Industry 4.0 (i4.0) is central to advanced manufacturing. Building on novel digital technologies, it enables smart and flexible manufacturing with systems connected across company boundaries and product lifecycle phases. Despite its benefits, the adoption of i4.0 has been limited, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. A key challenge is the technological complexity of i4.0. While advanced functionality requires technological complexity, it complicates an understanding of which enabling technologies are particularly useful and required. This article presents a framework to support successful i4.0 adoption across the entire product generation process through a systematic matrix-based dependency analysis of i4.0 solutions and underlying i4.0 technologies. Through increasing transparency around technological complexity of i4.0 solutions, this research contributes to a better understanding of which technologies are required for specific i4.0 solutions and which technologies could be strategic enablers for a broad variety of i4.0 applications. Knowing these technological dependencies supports both, the systematic adoption of existing i4.0 solutions and the development of new i4.0 solutions. This also sets the basis for a future socio-technical investigation.},

            The advent of smart manufacturing and the exposure to a new generation of technological enablers have revolutionized the way manufacturing process is carried out. Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are introduced as main actors of this manufacturing shift. They are characterized for having high levels of communication, integration and computational capabilities that led them to a certain level of autonomy. Despite the high expectations and vision of CPPS, it still remains an exploratory topic. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been widely used by software engineers to solve traditional computing problems, e.g., banking transactions. Because of their high levels of distribution and autonomous capabilities, MAS have been considered by the research community as a good solution to design and implement CPPS. This work first introduces a collection of requirements and characteristics of smart manufacturing. A comprehensive review of various research applications is presented to understand the current state of the art and the application of agent technology in manufacturing. Considering the smart manufacturing requirements and current research application, a SWOT analysis was formulated which identifies pros and cons of the implementation of agents in industry. The SWOT analysis was further validated by an industrial expert evaluation and the main findings and discussion of the results are presented.},

            On the one hand, Industry 4.0 provides possibilities to address arising challenges such as globalisation, individualisation and shortening product lifecycles. On the other hand, it also increases changes and challenges in planning and operation processes of production systems.
            The paper discusses the changes in digital work in the areas of planning, operating and improving smart production systems. Current research approaches show that especially in planning processes and supportive tasks a high dynamic is evident, but also the work on the shop floor is changing. Automation technology and intelligent algorithms as a base for production planning and control up to factory-as-a-service concepts reduce operational room for manual actions, but require new digital planning, implementation and maintenance tasks. Furthermore, technologies like cobots enable new forms of flexible coexistence between human and machine in production systems. Due to the increasing complexity of products and production systems, conventional improvement approaches from the fields of Lean Management and Six Sigma are reaching their limits, as the analyses are often limited to simple relationships and correlations. Data science in the industrial environment enables new opportunities to analyse large volumes of data to identify multivariate patterns and correlations. All of this leads to new requirements for competences, roles and work organisation.},

              Potential benefits of precision medicine in cardiovascular disease (CVD) include more accurate phenotyping of individual patients with the same condition or presentation, using multiple clinical, imaging, molecular and other variables to guide diagnosis and treatment. An approach to realising this potential is the digital twin concept, whereby a virtual representation of a patient is constructed and receives real-time updates of a range of data variables in order to predict disease and optimise treatment selection for the real-life patient. We explored the term digital twin, its defining concepts, the challenges as an emerging field, and potentially important applications in CVD. A mapping review was undertaken using a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature. Industry-based participants and patent applications were identified through web-based sources. Searches of Compendex, EMBASE, Medline, ProQuest and Scopus databases yielded 88 papers related to cardiovascular conditions (28\%,
              n
               = 25), non-cardiovascular conditions (41\%,
              n
               = 36), and general aspects of the health digital twin (31\%,
              n
               = 27). Fifteen companies with a commercial interest in health digital twin or simulation modelling had products focused on CVD. The patent search identified 18 applications from 11 applicants, of which 73\% were companies and 27\% were universities. Three applicants had cardiac-related inventions. For CVD, digital twin research within industry and academia is recent, interdisciplinary, and established globally. Overall, the applications were numerical simulation models, although precursor models exist for the real-time cyber-physical system characteristic of a true digital twin. Implementation challenges include ethical constraints and clinical barriers to the adoption of decision tools derived from artificial intelligence systems.},

            The digitalisation of the deep renovation process and built environment is enabled by ubiquitous connectivity and monitoring of the environment itself, the artefacts and actors within it, and events that occur. Such monitoring is important for efficient construction management, dynamic peak demand reduction, affordability, and occupants’ well-being. Sensor networks based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies represent an important prerequisite for both optimising and redefining the stages of the building process to meet environmental challenges. This chapter provides an overview of how computation capabilities are being integrated into the physical environment and the role of sensor networks in the context of deep renovation. The key advantages and benefits of these technologies at the pre, during and post-renovation stages are discussed together with different use cases. The value of sensor network infrastructures and the legal and ethical implications of the use of such sensor infrastructures is also discussed.},

              Cyber-physical systems are hybrid networked cyber and engineered physical elements that record data (e.g. using sensors), analyse them using connected services, influence physical processes and interact with human actors using multi-channel interfaces. Examples of CPS interacting with humans in industrial production environments are the so-called cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), where operators supervise the industrial machines, according to the human-in-the-loop paradigm. In this scenario, research challenges for implementing CPPS resilience, promptly reacting to faults, concern: (i) the complex structure of CPPS, which cannot be addressed as a monolithic system, but as a dynamic ecosystem of single CPS interacting and influencing each other; (ii) the volume, velocity and variety of data (Big Data) on which resilience is based, which call for novel methods and techniques to ensure recovery procedures; (iii) the involvement of human factors in these systems. In this paper, we address the design of resilient cyber-physical production systems (R-CPPS) in digital factories by facing these challenges. Specifically, each component of the R-CPPS is modelled as a
              smart machine
              , that is, a cyber-physical system equipped with a set of recovery services, a Sensor Data API used to collect sensor data acquired from the physical side for monitoring the component behaviour, and an operator interface for displaying detected anomalous conditions and notifying necessary recovery actions to on-field operators. A
              context-based mediator
              , at shop floor level, is in charge of ensuring resilience by gathering data from the CPPS, selecting the proper recovery actions and invoking corresponding recovery services on the target CPS. Finally,
              data summarisation and relevance evaluation
              techniques are used for supporting the identification of anomalous conditions in the presence of high volume and velocity of data collected through the Sensor Data API. The approach is validated in a food industry real case study.},

            Today’s supply chain is becoming complex and fragile. Hence, supply chain managers need to create and unlock the value of the smart supply chain. A smart supply chain requires connectivity, visibility, and agility, and it needs be integrated and intelligent. The digital twin (DT) concept satisfies these requirements. Therefore, we propose creating a DT-driven supply chain (DTSC) as an innovative and integrated solution for the smart supply chain. We provide background information to explain the DT concept and to demonstrate the method for building a DTSC by using the DT concept. We discuss three research opportunities in building a DTSC, including supply chain modeling, real-time supply chain optimization, and data usage in supply chain collaboration. Finally, we highlight a motivating case from JD.COM, China’s largest retailer by revenue, in applying the DTSC platform to address supply chain network reconfiguration challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

            Increasing freight volumes and challenging environments in seaports and container terminals worldwide require streamlined and reliable operations. Digital twins are seen as important drivers of the digitalization in seaports by providing a basis for higher transparency, control and data-driven decision making. In this context, however, the concept is rarely studied, and implementation issues are not comprehensively discussed. The paper presents an exploratory study of digital twins in seaports based on a literature review and case studies. The analysis reveals a standardization deficit for digital twin implementations, an inflationary and improper use of the term digital twin, and fields of research that need to be explored further. The application of optimization methods and the integration of simulation-based optimization in the field of seaports and container terminals is examined, due to its relevance for digital twins. Important lessons learned can be taken from the most advanced implementations, integrating simulations and emulations with optimization methods. An in-depth examination of multiple case studies and discussions with global port leaders yields valuable perspectives on the varied levels of digital twin implementations being applied today, including insights into the most advanced implementations currently being used in ports and container terminals. As a result of the analyses conducted, various research directions and a research agenda are presented.},

              Driven by the ongoing migration towards Industry 4.0, the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered smart manufacturing and digital transformation. AI enhances the migration towards industry 4.0 through AI-based decision-making by analyzing real-time data to optimize different processes such as production planning, predictive maintenance, quality control etc., thus guaranteeing reduced costs, high precision, efficiency and accuracy. This paper explores AI-driven smart manufacturing, revolutionizing traditional approaches and unlocking new possibilities throughout the major phases of the industrial equipment lifecycle. Through a comprehensive review, we delve into a wide range of AI techniques employed to tackle challenges such as optimizing process control, machining parameters, facilitating decision-making, and elevating maintenance strategies within the major phases of an industrial equipment lifecycle. These phases encompass design, manufacturing, maintenance, and recycling/retrofitting. As reported in the 2022 McKinsey Global Survey (
              https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review
              ), the adoption of AI has witnessed more than a two-fold increase since 2017. This has contributed to an increase in AI research within the last six years. Therefore, from a meticulous search of relevant electronic databases, we carefully selected and synthesized 42 articles spanning from 01 January 2017 to 20 May 2023 to highlight and review the most recent research, adhering to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and shedding light on the latest trends and popular AI techniques adopted by researchers. This includes AI techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM) etc., which are extensively discussed in this paper. Additionally, we provide insights into the advantages (e.g., enhanced decision making) and challenges (e.g., AI integration with legacy systems due to technical complexities and compatibilities) of integrating AI across the major stages of industrial equipment operations. Strategically implementing AI techniques in each phase enables industries to achieve enhanced productivity, improved product quality, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. This exploration of the potential of AI in smart manufacturing fosters agile and resilient processes, keeping industries at the forefront of technological advancements and harnessing the full potential of AI-driven solutions to improve manufacturing processes and products.},

            In recent years, driven by Industry 4.0 wave, academic research has focused on the science, engineering, and enabling technologies for intelligent and cyber manufacturing. Using a network science and data mining-based Keyword Co-occurrence Network (KCN) methodology, this work analyzes the trends in data science topics in the manufacturing literature over the past two decades to inform the researchers, educators, industry leaders of knowledge trends in intelligent manufacturing. It studies the evolution of research topics and methods in data science, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and cyber manufacturing. The KCN methodology is applied to systematically analyze the keywords collected from 84,041 papers published in top-tier manufacturing journals between 2000 and 2020. It is not practically feasible to review this large body of literature through tradition manual approaches like systematic review and scoping review to discover insights. The results of network modeling and data analysis reveal important knowledge components and structure of the intelligent and cyber manufacturing literature, implicit the research interests switch and provide the insights for industry development. This paper maps the high frequency keywords in the recent literature to nine pillars of Industry 4.0 to help manufacturing community identify research and education directions for emerging technologies in intelligent manufacturing.},

However, they also change the narrative of logistics management. Scholars in the areas of engineering, logistics, transportation, and management are attracted by this revolution. Operations management research on smart logistics mainly concerns the application of underlying technologies, business logic, operation framework, related management system, and optimization problems under specific scenarios. To explore these studies, the related literature has been systematically reviewed in this work. On the basis of the research gaps and the needs of industrial practices, future research directions in this field are also proposed.},

            Complex processes meet and need Industry 4.0 capabilities. Shorter product cycles, flexible production needs, and direct assessment of product quality attributes and raw material attributes call for an increased need of new process analytical technologies (PAT) concepts. While individual PAT tools may be available since decades, we need holistic concepts to fulfill above industrial needs. In this series of two contributions, we want to present a combined view on the future of PAT (process analytical technology), which is projected in smart labs (Part 1) and smart sensors (Part 2). Part 2 of this feature article series describes the future functionality as well as the ingredients of a smart sensor aiming to eventually fuel full PAT functionality. The smart sensor consists of (i) chemical and process information in the physical twin by smart field devices, by measuring multiple components, and is fully connected in the IIoT 4.0 environment. In addition, (ii) it includes process intelligence in the digital twin, as to being able to generate knowledge from multi-sensor and multi-dimensional data. The cyber-physical system (CPS) combines both elements mentioned above and allows the smart sensor to be self-calibrating and self-optimizing. It maintains its operation autonomously. Furthermore, it allows—as central PAT enabler—a flexible but also target-oriented predictive control strategy and efficient process development and can compensate variations of the process and raw material attributes. Future cyber-physical production systems—like smart sensors—consist of the fusion of two main pillars, the physical and the digital twins. We discuss the individual elements of both pillars, such as connectivity, and chemical analytics on the one hand as well as hybrid models and knowledge workflows on the other. Finally, we discuss its integration needs in a CPS in order to allow its versatile deployment in efficient process development and advanced optimum predictive process control.},

            In recent times, the literature has seen considerable growth in research at the intersection of digital innovation, data analytics, and supply chain resilience. While the number of studies on the topic has been burgeoning, due to the absence of a comprehensive literature review, it remains unclear what aspects of the subject have already been investigated and what are the avenues for impactful future research. Integrating bibliometric analysis with a systematic review approach, this paper offers the review of 262 articles at the nexus of innovative technologies, data analytics, and supply chain resiliency. The analysis uncovers the critical research clusters, the evolution of research over time, knowledge trajectories and methodological development in the area. Our thorough analysis enriches contemporary knowledge on the subject by consolidating the dispersed literature on the significance of innovative technologies, data analytics and supply chain resilience thereby recognizing major research clusters or domains and fruitful paths for future research. The review also helps improve practitioners’ awareness of the recent research on the topic by recapping key findings of a large amount of literature in one place.},

            The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) promises productivity gains in industrial practice. While IT technology offers a variety of technological advances, plant owners strive for stability and robustness of the production process. To overcome this tension field, we propose a set of 16 requirements for the development of industrial AI solutions to foster i) the adaptation process, ii) support the solution engineering and iii) ease the embedding into the existing system landscape while respecting iv) safety aspects to build up v) trust into industrial AI solutions. The proposed requirements can guide industrial stakeholders to focus on the right solution approach for specific production challenges and support them in voicing their own needs towards novel AI solutions. This will help AI developers to speed up time-to-market as well as to increase market acceptance of industrial AI solutions. Overall, specifying requirements on industrial AI will foster the acceptance and utilization rates of AI solutions in industrial practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings’ performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings’ management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings’ performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.},

            This article describes the impact of the global digital economy on the technological development of the mineral sector in the world. Due to the different specifics of the legislative bases of the investigated regions, such as the USA, China, EU, and Africa, the development of digital transformation is presented on the example of the Russian Federation in the context of world trends. The article presents an analysis of the possibilities of using straight-through digital technology in prospecting, design, development, and use of mineral resources. It describes a structure promoting the development of applied digital technology through research–education centers and international competence centers. This structure would allow forming the new competencies for personnel working in the digital economy. The underfunding of the information and computing infrastructure could be a significant challenge to the digital transformation of the economy. Creating the conditions for a reliable and secure process of generating, storing, and using data is the basis for protection from the cybersecurity hazard that could act as a brake on technology advancement. This article discusses the organizational and technological priorities of the development of the mineral resource sector on the example of the Russian Federation. The challenges for the mineral resource complex resulting from global changes can be taken on through technological changes of the industry. The article gives a thorough description of issues related to technological developments in the raw materials sector, oil refining industry, development of integrated and advanced mineral processing systems, and the use of household and industrial wastes. The research presents basic technology contributing to sustainable development, starting from exploration and production forecasting and up to sustainable planning and distribution of material and energy resources based on real-time data. It also pays special attention to the possibilities of creating digital platforms for the mineral sector. Digital integration, combining research areas, personnel, processes, users, and data will create conditions for scientific and technological achievements and breakthroughs, providing scientific and economic developments in related industries and, above all, in the global mineral and raw materials market.},

            The fourth industrial revolution is shaping a new industrial landscape. A variety of technologies related to software, information and communication technologies embody a ubiquitous digital and connectivity era. These technologies enable the creation of new products with the integration of connectivity, data collection and processing capacities which require combining engineering disciplines. Increasing product multidisciplinarity compels companies to adapt their product development practices. The scientific literature offers a variety of concepts and techniques to support multidisciplinary product development. This paper seeks to organize the landscape of concepts and techniques available for multidisciplinary product development. An extensive literature review was conducted, and 236 concepts and techniques were identified. Multidisciplinary products of interest deal with both software and hardware development and can be encountered through the denominations of cyber-physical systems, mechatronics and smart products and systems. An in-depth analysis led to the classification and mapping, for each product denomination, of the concepts and techniques available to support their development. The classification relies on a four-level model paired with a decision tree to thoroughly sort the variety of concepts and techniques into the approach, process, method, and tool levels. The mapping between the sorted concepts and techniques enabled the generation of graphical representations called cartographies. These cartographies serve to support companies’ transformation towards the fourth industrial revolution from the product development perspective by giving a general overview of the related literature, and guiding them in the identification of the most suitable approaches, processes, methods and tools.},

            According to contemporary challenges of digital evolution in management and maintenance of construction processes, the present study aims at defining valuable strategies for building management optimization. As buildings’ and infrastructures’ Digital Twins (DT) are directly connected to physical environment through the Internet of Things (IoT), asset management and control processes can be radically transformed. The proposed DT framework connects building information model (BIM) three-dimensional objects to information about the planned maintenance of components, supplying system’s self-learning capabilities through input data coming from Building Management Systems (BMSs), ticketing, as well as maintenance activities’ data flow both as-needed or unexpected. The concept of real-time acquisition and data processing set the basis for the proposed system architecture, allowing to perform analysis and evaluate alternative scenarios promptly responding to unexpected events with a higher accuracy over time. Moreover, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) allows the development of maintenance predictive capabilities, optimizing decision-making processes and implementing strategies based on the performed analysis, configuring a scalable approach useful for different scenarios. The proposed approach is related to the evolution from reactive to proactive strategies based on Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) for Building and Facility Management, providing actionable solutions through operational, monitoring and maintenance data. Through the integration of BIM data with information systems, BMS, IoT and machine learning, the optimization and real-time automation of maintenance activities are performed, radically reducing failures and systems’ breakdowns. Therefore, integrating different technologies in a virtual environment allows to define data-driven predictive models supporting Building Managers in decision-making processes improving efficiency over time and moving from reactive to proactive approaches.},

            Smart grids (SG) draw the attention of cyber attackers due to their vulnerabilities, which are caused by the usage of heterogeneous communication technologies and their distributed nature. While preventing or detecting cyber attacks is a well-studied field of research, making SG more resilient against such threats is a challenging task. This paper provides a classification of the proposed cyber resilience methods against cyber attacks for SG. This classification includes a set of studies that propose cyber-resilient approaches to protect SG and related cyber-physical systems against unforeseen anomalies or deliberate attacks. Each study is briefly analyzed and is associated with the proper cyber resilience technique which is given by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Special Publication 800-160. These techniques are also linked to the different states of the typical resilience curve. Consequently, this paper highlights the most critical challenges for achieving cyber resilience, reveals significant cyber resilience aspects that have not been sufficiently considered yet and, finally, proposes scientific areas that should be further researched in order to enhance the cyber resilience of SG.},

            Industry 5.0 (I5.0) is the next industrial revolution that will leverage human intervention in collaboration with intelligent, logical, and smart machines to attain even more user-preferred and resource-efficient manufacturing and supply chain solutions. The main aim of this article is to study I5.0 technologies in supply chains when these are affected by disruptive phenomena such as those created by wars, climate change or pandemics. A systematic literature review methodology was conducted to understand the present knowledge connected with this theme. This study summarises 194 research articles from the period 2009 to 2022 to understand the present knowledge connected with this theme. The research findings show a significant gap related to the adoption of I5.0 technologies to prevent or overcome supply chain disruptions. 194 articles, including journal and review articles, were identified in the literature. The study provides a novel and insightful concept related to I5.0 within the context of supply chain disruptions. The potential applications of I5.0 and Industry 4.0 are elaborately discussed in three areas, namely: (1) disruptions in supply chains due to pandemics; (2) disruptions in supply chains due to war; and (3) disruptions in supply chains due to climate change. Finally, this study highlights research implications and proposes future research avenues that will contribute to further exploring the adoption of I5.0 technologies to prevent, manage and overcome disruptions in supply chains.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper presents a systematic literature review on the application of digital twins in the energy sector. Initially, we generated an overview through a survey of prior reviews, independent of market vertical, then followed by a more detailed review concentrating on the power production and distribution domains, as per the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) smart grid standard. We implemented a rigorous method, which included seven stages, beginning with the collection of 2238 articles. We observed that the energy sector range was too broad and filtered by generation and distribution during the practical screening, resulting in 275 for further screening. This amount was then condensed to 81 papers that matched the quality screening criteria for synthesis and examination. In summary, digital twin architectures and frameworks include five components: the physical entity, bidirectional communication, the virtual entity (with modeling and simulation), data management, and services. Our study contributed by determining that distribution management is the most pertinent application of digital twins in the distribution domain and fault diagnosis in the generation domain. Furthermore, we found that digital twins involve multiple stakeholders whose role is rarely discussed in studies, and we identified a similar absence of emphasis for security. Research on security often presents the digital twin as an additional layer of protection, yet rarely investigates the security of the digital twin by itself. The potential limitations of our study to answer some of the technical research questions may be because of the criteria for the selection of papers. However, as the emphasis of this study is on the energy sector, it enabled domain-specific findings for generation and distribution.},

            The rapid adoption of digital technologies has revolutionized business operations and introduced emerging concepts such as Digital Twin (DT) technology, which has the potential to predict system responses before they occur, making it an attractive option for smart and sustainable tourism. However, implementing DT software systems poses significant challenges, including compliance with regulations and effective communication among stakeholders, and concerns surrounding security, privacy, and trust with the use of big data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a documentation framework for architectural decisions (DFAD) that applies the concept of big data governance to the digital system. The framework aims to ensure accountability, transparency, and trustworthiness while adhering to rules and regulations. To demonstrate its applicability, a case study and three case scenarios on the potential use of Mobile Positioning Data (MPD) in Indonesia for DT technology in smart and sustainable tourism were examined. The paper highlights the benefits of DFAD in shaping stakeholder communication and human–machine interactions while leveraging the potential of MPD to measure tourism statistics by Statistics Indonesia since 2016. Not only the documentation framework promotes compliance with regulations, but it also facilitates effective communication among stakeholders and enhances trust and transparency in the use of big data in DT technology for smart and sustainable tourism. This paper emphasizes the importance of effective big data governance and its potential to promote sustainable tourism practices. The multidisciplinarity approach on political science, software engineering, tourism, and official statistics provides an opportunity for academic contribution and decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In recent years, the manufacturing sector is going through a major transformation, as reflected in the concept of Industry 4.0 and digital transformation. The urge for such transformation is intensified when we consider the growing societal demands for sustainability. The notion of sustainable manufacturing has emerged as a result of this trend. Additionally, industries and the whole society face the challenges of an increasing number of disruptive events, either natural or human-caused, that can severely affect the normal operation of systems. Furthermore, the growing interconnectivity between organizations, people, and physical systems, supported by recent developments in information and communication technologies, highlights the important role that collaborative networks can play in the digital transformation processes. As such, this article analyses potential synergies between the areas of sustainable and resilient manufacturing and collaborative networks. The work also discusses how the responsibility for the various facets of sustainability can be distributed among the multiple entities involved in manufacturing. The study is based on a literature survey, complemented with the experience gained from various research projects and related initiatives in the area, and is organized according to various dimensions of Industry 4.0. A brief review of proposed approaches and indicators for measuring sustainability from the networked manufacturing perspective is also included. Finally, a set of key research challenges are identified to complement strategic research agendas in manufacturing.},

            Nowadays, the market competition becomes increasingly fierce due to diversified customer needs, stringent environmental requirements, and global competitors. One of the most important factors for companies to not only survive but also thrive in today’s competitive market is their logistics performance. This paper aims, through a systematic literature analysis of 115 papers from 2012 to 2020, at presenting quantitative insights and comprehensive overviews of the current and future research landscapes of sustainable logistics in the Industry 4.0 era. The results show that Industry 4.0 technologies provide opportunities for improving the economic efficiency, environmental performance, and social impact of logistics sectors. However, several challenges arise with this technological transformation, i.e., trade-offs among different sustainability indicators, unclear benefits, lifecycle environmental impact, inequity issues, and technology maturity. Thus, to better tackle the current research gaps, future suggestions are given to focus on the balance among different sustainability indicators through the entire lifecycle, human-centric technological transformation, system integration and digital twin, semi-autonomous transportation solutions, smart reverse logistics, and so forth.},

            City governance is vital for sustainable development goals and resource management and allocation as well as urban climate-related initiatives, as it is estimated that more people will reside in the urban areas in further years. As more people migrate to cities, the world steadily becomes more urbanised. The population of the cities accounts for 55\% of the total population, and cities generate 85\% of global gross domestic product and emit 75\% of greenhouse gas emissions. SDG-11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, aims to ensure inclusive, safe, resilient, sustainable urban and human settlements by providing inexpensive transit solutions, decreasing urban sprawl, enhancing urban governance involvement, improving the protection of cultural assets and addressing urban resilience and climate change issues. This chapter presents the business models of 50 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-11. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            Currently, Digital Twins receive considerable attention from practitioners and in research. A Digital Twin describes a concept that connects physical and virtual objects through a data linkage. However, Digital Twins are highly dependent on their individual use case, which leads to a plethora of Digital Twin configurations. Based on a thorough literature analysis and two interview series with experts from various electrical and mechanical engineering companies, this paper proposes a set of archetypes of Digital Twins for individual use cases. It delimits the Digital Twins from related concepts, e.g., Digital Threads. The paper delivers profound insights into the domain of Digital Twins and, thus, helps the reader to identify the different archetypical patterns.},

            This chapter presents a Digital Twin Pipeline Framework of the COGNITWIN project that supports Hybrid and Cognitive Digital Twins, through four Big Data and AI pipeline steps adapted for Digital Twins. The pipeline steps are Data Acquisition, Data Representation, AI/Machine learning, and Visualisation and Control. Big Data and AI Technology selections of the Digital Twin system are related to the different technology areas in the BDV Reference Model. A Hybrid Digital Twin is defined as a combination of a data-driven Digital Twin with First-order Physical models. The chapter illustrates the use of a Hybrid Digital Twin approach by describing an application example of Spiral Welded Steel Industrial Machinery maintenance, with a focus on the Digital Twin support for Predictive Maintenance. A further extension is in progress to support Cognitive Digital Twins includes support for learning, understanding, and planning, including the use of domain and human knowledge. By using digital, hybrid, and cognitive twins, the project’s presented pilot aims to reduce energy consumption and average duration of machine downtimes. Data-driven artificial intelligence methods and predictive analytics models that are deployed in the Digital Twin pipeline have been detailed with a focus on decreasing the machinery’s unplanned downtime. We conclude that the presented pipeline can be used for similar cases in the process industry.},

            The objective of increasing productivity while optimizing operational and organizational processes has focused Industry 4.0 (I4.0) on technological development without considering the impact of technology on people and the impact of mass production on the environment. These impacts have led to growing concerns about climate change and complex global risks. A new vision of the industry, called Industry 5.0 (I5.0), has emerged within the scientific community. This human-centred industry appears to be a bold turn from individual technologies to a systematic approach that enables industry to achieve societal and environmental goals beyond economic growth. Under this approach, the question is no longer whether asset management should change, but what that transformation should look like. This paper identifies areas for improvement of the asset management process and presents a framework that incorporates the core values of I5.0 within the overall asset management framework, in which the core principles remain, and the new technologies are the enabling functions. Though the primary focus of this paper on manufacturing and industrial systems, many of its concept and ideas are also relevant to asset management in the public sector infrastructure systems.},

            Developing and underdeveloped countries need durable infrastructure investments, sustainable industrial breakthroughs and innovative approaches to achieve sustainable economic growth and social and grassroots development and combat climate change. SDG-9, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, is based on three main themes. To provide transportation, information and communication infrastructures, which are an important part of development in line with these goals, the key to sustainable economic growth and raising the welfare level of the society is to develop industrialisation, and new technological developments and new skills in line with innovation are discussed. This chapter presents the business models of 59 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-9. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            The study of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a continuous endeavor of scientists and engineers for over 65 years. The simple contention is that human-created machines can do more than just labor-intensive work; they can develop human-like intelligence. Being aware or not, AI has penetrated into our daily lives, playing novel roles in industry, healthcare, transportation, education, and many more areas that are close to the general public. AI is believed to be one of the major drives to change socio-economical lives. In another aspect, AI contributes to the advancement of state-of-the-art technologies in many fields of study, as helpful tools for groundbreaking research. However, the prosperity of AI as we witness today was not established smoothly. During the past decades, AI has struggled through historical stages with several winters. Therefore, at this juncture, to enlighten future development, it is time to discuss the past, present, and have an outlook on AI. In this article, we will discuss from a historical perspective how challenges were faced on the path of revolution of both the AI tools and the AI systems. Especially, in addition to the technical development of AI in the short to mid-term, thoughts and insights are also presented regarding the symbiotic relationship of AI and humans in the long run.},

            Innovation plays a critical role in the mining industry as a tool to improve the efficiency of its processes, to reduce costs, but also to meet the increasing social and environmental concerns among communities and authorities. Technological progress has also been crucial to allow the exploitation of new deposits in more complex scenarios: lower ore grades, extreme weather conditions, deeper deposits, harder rock mass, and high-stress environments. This paper discusses the importance of innovation for the mining industry and describes the mechanisms by which it is carried out. It includes a review of the drivers and actors involved and current trends. The digital transformation process that the industry is going through is analyzed, along with other relevant trends that are likely to shape the mining of the future. Additionally, a case study is presented to illustrate the technical and economic implications of developing a disruptive innovation project.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The transformation of power grids into intelligent cyber-physical systems brings numerous benefits, but also significantly increases the surface for cyber-attacks, demanding appropriate countermeasures. However, the development, validation, and testing of data-driven countermeasures against cyber-attacks, such as machine learning-based detection approaches, lack important data from real-world cyber incidents. Unlike attack data from real-world cyber incidents, infrastructure knowledge and standards are accessible through expert and domain knowledge. Our proposed approach uses domain knowledge to define the behavior of a smart grid under non-attack conditions and detect attack patterns and anomalies. Using a graph-based specification formalism, we combine cross-domain knowledge that enables the generation of whitelisting rules not only for statically defined protocol fields but also for communication flows and technical operation boundaries. Finally, we evaluate our specification-based intrusion detection system against various attack scenarios and assess detection quality and performance. In particular, we investigate a data manipulation attack in a future-orientated use case of an IEC 60870-based SCADA system that controls distributed energy resources in the distribution grid. Our approach can detect severe data manipulation attacks with high accuracy in a timely and reliable manner.},

            The development of digital transformation in the construction industry has led to the increasing adoption of smart contracts. As programmable applications to automatically write, verify, and enforce transaction conditions, smart contracts can be used in different areas mainly to improve automation level, information security, and built digital environment enhancement. However, the smart contract is commonly mentioned as a blockchain appendage, while its unique connotation and value in the construction industry have not been recognized. Therefore, this study carries out a systematic review based on 81 research articles published from 2014 to 2021 on smart contract applications in construction to explore and highlight their potentials under domain-specific requirements. Results are analyzed according to research type categorization and domain codification. Eight research domains are identified, where the three most highly explored domains are contract and payment, supply chain and logistics, and information management. The integration of smart contracts with other innovative concepts and advanced technologies is analyzed. The applicability, benefits, and challenges of smart contract applications regarding different research domains are discussed.},

In this article, we analyse the publication as it touches on broader themes ranging from digital literacy, to cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Within this context, in this article, we use the EC publication as a point of departure to explore themes central to national and international digital transformation and policy writ large. As such, this article is to be read as a thematic analysis rather than a close reading of the EC’s publication. The article is divided into three parts: an executive findings and recommendations section (where our main findings are articled); Themes and Key Takeaways (where we thematically flesh out the document); and, EU Data Strategy document summary (where we provide an overview summary the document itself).},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Digital transformation (DT) has become a buzzword, triggering different disciplines in research and influencing practice, which leads to independent research streams. Scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. Approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. Thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. With this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of DT research from a holistic business perspective. We identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. Our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. Within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. However, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. This study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. Yet, research on DT still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. The findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on DT from a business perspective.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Driven by digital technologies, manufacturers aim to tap into data-driven business models, in which value is generated from data as a complement to physical products. However, this transformation can be complex, as different archetypes of data-driven business models require substantially different business and technical capabilities. While there are manifold contributions to research on technical capability development, an integrated and aligned perspective on both business and technology capabilities for distinct data-driven business model archetypes is needed. This perspective promises to enhance research’s understanding of this transformation and offers guidance for practitioners. As maturity models have proven to be valuable tools in capability development, we follow a design science approach to develop a maturity model for the transformation toward archetypal data-driven business models. To provide an integrated perspective on business and technology capabilities, the maturity model leverages a layered enterprise architecture model. By applying and evaluating in use at two manufacturers, we find two different transformation approaches, namely ‘data first’ and ‘business first’. The resulting insights highlight the model’s integrative perspective’s value for research to improve the understanding of this transformation. For practitioners, the maturity model allows a status quo assessment and derives fields of action to develop the capabilities required for the aspired data-driven business model.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            There have recently been intensive efforts aimed at addressing the challenges of environmental degradation and climate change through the applied innovative solutions of AI, IoT, and Big Data. Given the synergistic potential of these advanced technologies, their convergence is being embraced and leveraged by smart cities in an attempt to make progress toward reaching the environmental targets of sustainable development goals under what has been termed “environmentally sustainable smart cities.” This new paradigm of urbanism represents a significant research gap in and of itself. To fill this gap, this study explores the key research trends and driving factors of environmentally sustainable smart cities and maps their thematic evolution. Further, it examines the fragmentation, amalgamation, and transition of their underlying models of urbanism as well as their converging AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies and solutions. It employs and combines bibliometric analysis and evidence synthesis methods. A total of 2,574 documents were collected from the Web of Science database and compartmentalized into three sub-periods: 1991–2015, 2016–2019, and 2020–2021. The results show that environmentally sustainable smart cities are a rapidly growing trend that markedly escalated during the second and third periods—due to the acceleration of the digitalization and decarbonization agendas—thanks to COVID-19 and the rapid advancement of data-driven technologies. The analysis also reveals that, while the overall priority research topics have been dynamic over time—some AI models and techniques and environmental sustainability areas have received more attention than others. The evidence synthesized indicates that the increasing criticism of the fragmentation of smart cities and sustainable cities, the widespread diffusion of the SDGs agenda, and the dominance of advanced ICT have significantly impacted the materialization of environmentally sustainable smart cities, thereby influencing the landscape and dynamics of smart cities. It also suggests that the convergence of AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies provides new approaches to tackling the challenges of environmental sustainability. However, these technologies involve environmental costs and pose ethical risks and regulatory conundrums. The findings can inform scholars and practitioners of the emerging data-driven technology solutions of smart cities, as well as assist policymakers in designing and implementing responsive environmental policies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Emerging smart manufacturing technologies combine physical production networks with digital IT systems, resulting in complex smart factory networks, which are especially vulnerable to IT security risks, such as IT component non-availabilities. Companies must employ extensive IT security measures to secure their production facilities. However, complex network structures and inherent dependencies of smart factory networks complicate corresponding investment decisions and increase the need for appropriate decision support. We develop a risk assessment model that supports companies in the investment decision-making process regarding IT security measures by identifying and evaluating the most critical areas of the information network while considering the underlying production network. For this purpose, IT availability risks are quantified by means of graph theory, matrix notation, and value-at-risk. Our model provides a structured approach and considers network structures and interdependencies. The insights gained by our model present a profound economic basis for investment decisions on IT security measures. By applying our model in an exemplary real-world setting, we analyze various IT security measures and their risk reduction effect.},

            In this paper a program and methodology for bibliometric mining of research trends and directions is presented. The method is applied to the research area Big Data for the time period 2012 to 2022, using the Scopus database. It turns out that the 10 most important research directions in Big Data are Machine learning, Deep learning and neural networks, Internet of things, Data mining, Cloud computing, Artificial intelligence, Healthcare, Security and privacy, Review, and Manufacturing. The role of Big Data research in different fields of science and technology is also analysed. For four geographic regions (North America, European Union, China, and The Rest of the World) different activity levels in Big Data during different parts of the time period are analysed. North America was the most active region during the first part of the time period. During the last years China is the most active region. The citation scores for documents from different regions and from different research directions within Big Data are also compared. North America has the highest average citation score among the geographic regions and the research direction Review has the highest average citation score among the research directions. The program and methodology for bibliometric mining developed in this study can be used also for other large research areas. Now that the program and methodology have been developed, it is expected that one could perform a similar study in some other research area in a couple of days.},

            From its origins as a computer-aided three-dimensional modelling tool, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has evolved to incorporate time scheduling, cost management, and ultimately an information management framework that has the potential to enhance decision-making throughout the whole life-cycle of built assets. This chapter summarises state-of-the-art BIM and its benefits. It then considers the particular characteristics of deep renovation projects, the challenges confronting their delivery, and the potential for using BIM to meet the challenges. This includes the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to BIM models to optimise deep renovation project delivery. The prospects for this are encouraging, but further development work, including the creation of ontologies that are appropriate for renovation work, is still needed.},

            Economic growth can be defined by increasing consumption due to the increase in population and reaching production amounts to meet consumption with technological developments and governmental incentives. The correct placement of people in the production and consumption equation can be expressed as decent work. Although decent work and economic growth may seem like different terms at first glance, they are inseparable terms for each other. SDG-8, Decent Work and Economic Growth, aims to attain full and productive employment, as well as respectable work, for all women and men by 2030. This chapter presents the business models of 37 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-8. We should highlight that one use case can be related to more than one SDG and it can make use of multiple emerging technologies.},

            The subjectivity and inaccuracy of in-clinic Cognitive Health Assessments (CHA) have led many researchers to explore ways to automate the process to make it more objective and to facilitate the needs of the healthcare industry. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as the most promising approaches to automate the CHA process. In this paper, we explore the background of CHA and delve into the extensive research recently undertaken in this domain to provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art. In particular, a careful selection of significant works published in the literature is reviewed to elaborate a range of enabling technologies and AI/ML techniques used for CHA, including conventional supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and image processing techniques. Furthermore, we provide an overview of various means of data acquisition and the benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in using AI and ML for CHA along with some possible solutions. In summary, this paper presents CHA tools, lists various data acquisition methods for CHA, provides technological advancements, presents the usage of AI for CHA, and open issues, challenges in the CHA domain. We hope this first-of-its-kind survey paper will significantly contribute to identifying research gaps in the complex and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary mental health field.},

            Digital Twins offer considerable potential for cross-company networks. Recent research primarily focuses on using Digital Twins within the limits of a single organization. However, Shared Digital Twins extend application boundaries to cross-company utilization through their ability to act as a hub to share data. This results in the need to consider additional design dimensions which help practitioners design Digital Twins tailored for inter-company use. The article addresses precisely that issue as it investigates how Shared Digital Twins should be designed to achieve business success. For this purpose, the article proposes a set of design principles for Shared Digital Twins stemming from a qualitative interview study with 18 industry experts. The interview study is the primary data source for formulating and evaluating the design principles.},

            The COVID-19 pandemic before mass vaccination can be restrained only by the limitation of contacts between people, which makes the digital economy a key condition for survival. More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and many cities have already transformed into “smart” digital/virtual hubs. Digital services ensure city life safe without an economy lockout and unemployment. Urban society strives to be safe, sustainable, well-being, and healthy. We set the task to construct a hybrid sociological and technological concept of a smart city with matched solutions, complementary to each other. Our modeling with the elaborated digital architectures and with the bionic solution for ensuring sufficient data governance showed that a smart city in comparison with the traditional city is tightly interconnected inside like a social “organism”. Society has entered a decisive decade during which the world will change by moving closer towards SDGs targets 2030 as well as by the transformation of cities and their digital infrastructures. It is important to recognize the large vector of sociological transformation as smart cities are just a transition phase to human-centered personal space or smart home. The “atomization” of the world urban population raises the gap problem in achieving SDGs because of different approaches to constructing digital architectures for smart cities or smart homes in countries. The strategy of creating smart cities should bring each citizen closer to SDGs at the individual level, laying in the personal space the principles of sustainable development and wellness of personality.},

            Advanced knowledge engineering (KE), represented by knowledge graph (KG), drives the development of various fields and engineering technologies and provides various knowledge fusion and knowledge empowerment interfaces. At the same time, advanced system engineering (SE) takes model-based system engineering (MBSE) as the core to realize formal modeling and process analysis of the whole system. The two complement each other and are the key technologies for the transition from 2.0 to 3.0 in the era of artificial intelligence and the transition from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence. This survey summarizes an advanced information fusion system, from model-driven to knowledge-enabled. Firstly, the concept, representative methods, key technologies and application fields of model-driven system engineering are introduced. Then, it introduces the concept of knowledge-driven knowledge engineering, summarizes the architecture and construction methods of advanced knowledge engineering and summarizes the application fields. Finally, the combination of advanced information fusion systems, development opportunities and challenges are discussed.},

            Digital transformation is continuously changing ecosystems, which also forces established companies to re-evaluate their value proposition. However, only transformations of single ecosystems have been studied. Therefore, this work targets to examine the similarities of digital transformation in five platform ecosystems: automotive, blockchain, financial, insurance, and IIoT. For our analysis, we combine the strengths of conceptual modeling using e3 value with a cluster analysis based on text mining to identify similarities in the respective ecosystems. As a result, we identified 15 clusters. Cluster 01 is the core cluster, containing the roles of organizations from all five ecosystems. Cluster 02–05 are intertwined, as they include roles from at least two ecosystems. Clusters 06–15 are ecosystem-specific that only include roles found in one ecosystem. Scholars and practitioners can use these clusters when analyzing or building a new platform ecosystem, or transforming a traditional ecosystem towards a platform ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The proliferation of IoT devices has influenced end users in several aspects. Yottabytes (YB) of information are being produced in the IoT environs because of the ever-increasing utilization capacity of the Internet. Since sensitive information, as well as privacy problems, always seem to be an unsolved problem, even with best-in-class in-formation governance standards, it is difficult to bolster defensive security capabilities. Secure data sharing across disparate systems is made possible by blockchain technology, which operates on a decentralized computing paradigm. In the ever-changing IoT environments, blockchain technology provides irreversibility (immutability) usage across a wide range of services and use cases. Therefore, blockchain technology can be leveraged to securely hold private information, even in the dynamicity context of the IoT. However, as the rate of change in IoT networks accelerates, every potential weak point in the system is exposed, making it more challenging to keep sensitive data se-cure. In this study, we adopted a Multi-level Blockchain-based Secured Framework (M-BSF) to provide multi-level protection for sensitive data in the face of threats to IoT-based networking systems. The envisioned M-BSF framework incorporates edge-level, fog-level, and cloud-level security. At edge- and fog-level security, baby kyber and scaling kyber cryptosystems are applied to ensure data preservation. Kyber is a cryptosystem scheme that adopts public-key encryption and private-key decryption processes. Each block of the blockchain uses the cloud-based Argon-2di hashing method for cloud-level data storage, providing the highest level of confidentiality. Argon-2di is a stable hashing algorithm that uses a hybrid approach to access the memory that relied on dependent and independent memory features. Based on the attack-resistant rate ({\textgreater} 96\%), computational cost (in time), and other main metrics, the proposed M-BSF security architecture appears to be an acceptable alternative to the current methodologies.},

              Maintaining pace with ongoing changes due to digitalization is challenging for manufacturing companies. For successful implementation of digitalization, manufacturing companies must consider their existing technical systems, organizational structures, and processes, as well as social aspects. With the support of a maturity model, a company-specific digitalization level can be evaluated to provide manufacturing companies with an initial insight into their particular status quo; this can serve as a starting point for future optimization and digitalization projects. Furthermore, the results of such an analysis allow objective comparison of different areas within the company and with competitors. In this paper, the “Integrierte Arbeitssystemgestaltung in digitalisierten Produktionsunternehmen” (InAsPro) maturity model is presented, which considers the
              Development
              ,
              Production
              , and

              product lifecycle phases, as well as
              Aftersales
              , and assesses their digitalization level focusing on the four dimensions of
              Technology
              ,
              Organization
              ,
              Social Issues
              , and
              Corporate Strategy
              . The maturity model’s rating scale distinguishes between four maturity levels. The results given by the InAsPro maturity model for an entire company are presented, along with those for each product lifecycle phase. Extensive descriptions for each specific maturity level are also provided.},

            In order to ensure the safety and security of industrial systems with regard to all life cycle phases from development through operation to disposal, specific regulatory and normative requirements are imposed. Due to the digitalization, interconnection, and constantly increasing complexity of manufacturing systems in the context of Industrie 4.0, the manual effort necessary to achieve the required safety and security is becoming ever greater and almost impossible to manage, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, this paper examines the existing challenges in this area in more detail and gives an outlook on the possible solutions to ensure safety and security much quicker and with less manual effort. The overall vision is a (partially) automated risk assessment of modular systems with respect to safety and security, including the alignment of the corresponding processes from both domains and the formalization of the information models needed.

            Zusammenfassung
            Um Safety und Security von industriellen Systemen im Hinblick auf alle Lebenszyklusphasen von der Entwicklung über den Betrieb bis zur Entsorgung zu gewährleisten, werden bestimmte regulatorische und normative Anforderungen gestellt. Durch die Digitalisierung, Vernetzung und stetig steigende Komplexität von Fertigungssystemen im Kontext von Industrie 4.0 wird der manuelle Aufwand zur Sicherstellung der geforderten Safety und Security immer größer und vor allem für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen kaum noch bewältigbar. Daher untersucht dieser Artikel die bestehenden Probleme in diesem Bereich genauer und gibt einen Ausblick auf die möglichen Lösungen, um Safety und Security deutlich schneller und mit weniger manuellem Aufwand zu gewährleisten. Ziel ist eine (teil-) automatisierte Risikobeurteilung von modularen Systemen in Bezug auf Safety und Security, einschließlich des Abgleichs der entsprechenden Prozesse aus beiden Domänen und der Formalisierung der benötigten Informationsmodelle.},

            As wind turbines continue to grow in size, they are increasingly being deployed offshore. This causes operation and maintenance of wind turbines becoming more challenging. Digitalization is a key enabling technology to manage wind farms in hostile environments and potentially increasing safety and reducing operational and maintenance costs. Digital infrastructure based on Industry 4.0 concept, such as digital twin, enables data collection, visualization, and analysis of wind power analytic at either individual turbine or wind farm level. In this paper, the concept of predictive digital twin for wind farm applications is introduced and demonstrated. To this end, a digital twin platform based on Unity3D for visualization and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) for data communication is developed. The platform is completed with the Prophet prediction algorithm to detect potential failure of wind turbine components in the near future and presented in augmented reality to enhance user experience. The presentation is intuitive and easy to use. The limitations of the platform include a lack of support for specific features like electronic signature, enhanced failover, and historical data sources. Simulation results based on the Hywind Tampen floating wind farm configuration show our proposed platform has promising potentials for offshore wind farm applications.},

Integrating AI into the fabric of urban infrastructure marks a monumental leap in societal evolution, underscoring the imperative to cultivate and advance AI technologies. This paper endeavors to elucidate the multifaceted applications of AI within the domains of smart cities, illuminating its pivotal role in shaping and advancing our contemporary era. From intelligent transportation systems and energy management to public safety and healthcare, AI permeates various aspects of urban life, ushering in unprecedented efficiencies and novel solutions to age-old challenges. The symbiotic relationship between AI and smart cities is explored in detail, showcasing how AI technologies are instrumental in optimizing resource allocation, improving decision-making processes, and ultimately enhancing the overall quality of life. Furthermore, this paper delves into the imperative of fostering the development and advancement of AI technologies within the context of smart cities. It underscores the interconnectedness of technological progress and urban development, emphasizing how a concerted effort to cultivate AI capabilities can propel cities into a future marked by sustainable growth, resilience, and innovation. The exploration of challenges and opportunities in deploying AI within urban environments adds a critical dimension to the discourse, encouraging a balanced consideration of ethical, regulatory, and societal implications. In conclusion, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding smart cities and the transformative impact of AI. By shedding light on the diverse applications of AI within urban landscapes and emphasizing its pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of our era, it underscores the critical importance of advancing AI technology development for the continued progress of smart cities and, by extension, the broader global community.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Companies employing an Engineer-to-Order (ETO) manufacturing strategy often develop, design and produce complex goods in single or small batches based on an individual customer order. The increased complexity caused by project business multiplies the engineering, cost, and change management efforts that are often required, resulting in lost productivity and more non-value-adding activities. To improve efficiency and reduce losses, ETO organizations strive to implement Lean practices and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, but the relevant literature in ETO industrial context is more exploratory and contains less empirical data. Building on the preliminary work categorizing the common losses in ETO organizations, the study examined how these can be reduced by Lean and I4.0 practices. Current literature was analyzed, and empirical data was collected using a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with 16 companies from the construction, shipbuilding, and machinery and plant manufacturing industries. The scientific literature was compared with the empirical data to find out whether Lean methods and I4.0 technologies are known in research but not applied in practice and vice versa. As a result, there are several practices from both domains applied in practice to reduce losses, but the analyzed literature indicates few successful implementations. Future research should aim to provide more empirical data on the application of Lean and I4.0 practices to mitigate losses in companies with an ETO strategy and provide best practices and guidelines.},

            In the dynamic and changing realm of technology and business operations, staying abreast of recent trends is paramount. This review evaluates the progress in the development of the integration of machine learning (ML) with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, revealing the impact of these trends on the ERP optimization. In recent years, there has been a significant advancement in the integration of ML technology within ERP environments. ML algorithms characterized by their ability to extract intricate patterns from vast datasets are being harnessed to enable ERP systems to make more accurate predictions and data-driven decisions. Therefore, ML enables ERP systems to adapt dynamically based on real-time insights, resulting in enhanced efficiency and adaptability. Furthermore, organizations are increasingly looking for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions as they actually try to make ML models within ERP clear and comprehensible for stakeholders. These solutions enable ERP systems to process and act on data as it flows in, due to the utilization of ML models, which enables enterprises to react effectively to changing circumstances. The rapid insights and useful intelligence offered by this trend have had a significant impact across industries. IoT (Internet of Things) and ML integration with ERP are continuously gaining significance. These algorithms allow for the creation of adaptable strategies supported by ongoing learning and data-driven optimization, which has a number of benefits for ERP system optimization. In addition, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) was investigated in this review to provide the state-of-the-art and emerging challenges due to ML integration. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the integration of machine learning algorithms across several ERP applications by conducting an extensive literature assessment of recent publications. By synthesizing the latest research findings, this comprehensive review provides an in-depth analysis of the cutting-edge techniques and recent advancements in the context of machine learning (ML)-driven optimization of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. It not only provides an insight into the methodology and impact of the state-of-the-art but also offers valuable insights into where the future of ML in ERP may lead, propelling ERP systems into a new era of intelligence, efficiency, and innovation.},

            The global industrial mining sector is, like other sectors, undergoing an unprecedented transformation pushed by global sustainability and climate challenges. The need to increase productivity and efficiency of mineral extraction along with increasing pressure from a wide range of stakeholders to decarbonise the industry and make mining practices more sustainable, accountable, and socially acceptable are driving the adoption of automation and digitalisation technologies as well as the electrification of equipment and the implementation of more sustainable energy solutions for the industry. Automation and digitalisation are changing the way minerals and metals are extracted and provide important tools for designing and implementing the mine of the future: a digitally integrated, autonomous mine where no humans need to be put in harm’s way and in which the connected systems are able to reduce the ever-increasing complexity to such an extent that improved decision-making can be realised in real time. Mining as an industry still has a way to go to reach the potential of automation and digitalisation on the one hand, and alternative drive systems and sustainable power generation on the other. This paper will give an overview of empirically derived leading technologies underlying the current transformation and will place them in the context of the data-information-value-chain that can provide a more systematic approach to describe the various technologies and, in particular, their interrelationships. This can support a better understanding of assessing the overall technological maturity of an operation, especially with respect to their evolution from automation of equipment towards autonomous systems. There is no reason to doubt that, from a technology perspective, the digitally connected, autonomous, and carbon-free mine have the potential to become a reality. Breakthrough effects can be expected to come not from any single technology but rather from successfully developing, implementing, and integrating the full suite of (available) automation and digitalisation technologies across entire mining operations and moving towards digitally integrated, autonomous systems considering the process and its interrelations holistically (Clausen et al. 2020b). However, in order to get there, mining companies need to consider not only the technological aspects of this transformation. For successfully responding to the changing landscape of stakeholder expectations and future-proofing the industry requires, the authors argue that mining companies need to adopt a mind-set of the human-centred climate smart mine (Clausen and Sörensen 2021). In addition, mining companies need to reconsider their role in the economic, social, and environmental ecosystem they are embedded in so they can break through traditions that keep them from successfully positioning themselves as builders of social value.},

            Distribution networks are evolving to become more responsive with increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and digital transformation at the grid edges. This evolution imposes many challenges to the operation of the network, which then calls for new control and operation paradigms. Among others, a so-called grid-edge control is emerging to harmonise the coexistence of the grid control system and DER’s autonomous control. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the grid-edge control with various control architectures, layers, and strategies. The challenges and opportunities for such an approach at the grid edge with the integration of DERs and digital transformation are summarised. The potential solutions to support the network operation by using the inherent controllability of DER and the availability of the digital transformation at the grid edges are discussed.},

            Mobility robots may soon be among us, triggering a need for safety regulation. Robot safety regulation, however, remains underexplored, with only a few articles analyzing what regulatory approaches could be feasible. This article offers an account of the available regulatory strategies and attempts to theorize the effects of simulation-based safety regulation. The article first discusses the distinctive features of mobility robots as regulatory targets and argues that emergent behavior constitutes the key regulatory concern in designing robot safety regulation regimes. In contrast to many accounts, the article posits that emergent behavior dynamics do not arise from robot autonomy, learning capability, or code unexplainability. Instead, they emerge from the complexity of robot technological constitutions coupled with near-infinite environmental variability and non-linear performance dynamics of the machine learning components. Second, the article reviews rules-based and performance-based regulation and argues that both will fail adequately constrain emergent robot behaviors. The article claims that controlling mobility robots requires a simulation-based regulatory approach. Simulation-based regulation is a novelty with significant theoretical and practical implications. The article argues that the approach signifies a radical break in regulatory forms of knowledge and temporalities. Simulations enact virtual futures to create a new regulatory knowledge type. Practically, the novel safety knowledge type may destabilize the existing conceptual space of safety politics and liability allocation patterns.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With increasing automation of manufacturing processes (focusing on technologies such as robotics and human-robot interaction), there is a realisation that the manufacturing process and the artefacts/products it produces can be better connected post-production. Built on this requirement, a “chatty" factory involves creating products which are able to send data back to the manufacturing/production environment as they are used, whilst still ensuring user privacy. The intended use of a product during design phase may different significantly from actual usage. Understanding how this data can be used to support continuous product refinement, and how the manufacturing process can be dynamically adapted based on the availability of this data provides a number of opportunities. We describe how data collected on product use can be used to: (i) classify product use; (ii) associate a label with product use using unsupervised learning—making use of edge-based analytics; (iii) transmission of this data to a cloud environment where labels can be compared across different products of the same type. Federated learning strategies are used on edge devices to ensure that any data captured from a product can be analysed locally (ensuring data privacy).},

            Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), including monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis, and health management, occupies an increasingly important position in reducing costly breakdowns and avoiding catastrophic accidents in modern industry. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL) approaches, the application of AI-enabled methods to monitor, diagnose and predict potential equipment malfunctions has gone through tremendous progress with verified success in both academia and industry. However, there is still a gap to cover monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis based on AI-enabled methods, simultaneously, and the importance of an open source community, including open source datasets and codes, has not been fully emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper provides a systematic overview of the current development, common technologies, open source datasets, codes, and challenges of AI-enabled PHM methods from three aspects of monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis.},

            Attention is currently being focused on DevOps, which aims to reduce software development time by means of close collaboration between the development and operations areas. However, little effort has been made to determine the role of requirements management in DevOps. The objective of this study is to help both researchers and practitioners by providing an overview of the best practices regarding requirements engineering in DevOps and identifying which areas still need to be investigated. A multivocal mapping study has, therefore, been carried out in order to study which methodologies, techniques and tools are used to support requirements management in DevOps environments. After applying the review protocol, 37 papers from formal literature and 14 references from grey literature were selected for analysis. The general conclusions obtained after analysing these papers were that, within DevOps, more attention should be paid to: (1) the reuse of requirements in order to identify systems and software artefacts that can serve as a basis for the specification of new projects; (2) the communication of requirements between the different areas of an organisation and the stakeholders of a project; (3) the traceability of requirements in order to identify the relationship with other requirements, artefacts, tasks and processes; (4) non-functional requirements in order to identify the requirements of the operations area in the early phases of a project; and finally (5) specific requirements tools that should be seamlessly integrated into the DevOps toolchain. All these issues must be considered without ignoring the agile and continuous practices of development, operations and business teams. More effort must also be made to validate new methodologies in industry so as to assess and determine their strengths and weaknesses.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This chapter describes how smart applications from multiple domains can participate in the creation of data spaces based on FIWARE software building blocks. Smart applications participating in such data spaces share digital twin data in real time using a common standard API like NGSI-LD and relying on standard data models. Each smart solution contributes to build a complete digital twin data representation of the real world sharing their data. At the same time, they can exploit data shared by other applications. Relying on FIWARE Data Marketplace components, smart applications can publish data under concrete terms and conditions which include pricing or data usage/access policies.
            A federated cloud infrastructure and mechanisms supporting data sovereignty are necessary to create data spaces. However, additional elements have to be added to ease the creation of data value chains and the materialization of a data economy. Standard APIs, combined with standard data models, are crucial to support effective data exchange enabling loose coupling between parties as well as reusability and replaceability of data resources and applications. Similarly, data spaces need to incorporate mechanisms for publication, discovery, and trading of data resources. These are elements that FIWARE implements, and they can be combined with IDSA architecture elements like the IDS Connector to create data spaces supporting trusted and effective data sharing.
            The GAIA-X project, started in 2020, is aimed at creating a federated form of data infrastructure in Europe which strengthens the ability to both access and share data securely and confidently. FIWARE is bringing mature technologies, compatible with IDS and CEF Building Blocks, which will accelerate the delivery of GAIA-X to the market.},

            Discovering malicious packets amid a cloud of normal activity, whether you use an IDS or gather and analyze machine and device log files on company infrastructure, may be challenging and time consuming. The vulnerability landscape is rapidly evolving, and it will only become worse as more and more developing technologies, such as IoT, Industrial Automation, CPS, Digital Twins, etc are digitally connected. A honey trap aids in identifying malicious packets easily as, after a few rapid calibrations to eliminate false positives. Besides analyzing and reporting particular invasion patterns or toolkits exploited, it also assists in preventing access to actual devices by simulating the genuine systems and applications functioning in the network thus delaying as well as baffling the invader. In order to analyze and evaluate the hackers’ behavior, an ensemble of research honeypot detectors has been deployed in our work. This paper delivers a robust outline of the deployment of containerized honeypot deployment, as a direct consequence, these are portable, durable, and simple to deploy and administer. The instrumented approach was monitored and generated countless data points on which significant judgments about the malevolent users’ activities and purpose could be inferred.},

              Organizations face attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) as vulnerabilities are pervasive. However, patching vulnerable systems by simply updating to the newest version is often not an option and shifts focus to workarounds. Beyond pure patching, workarounds specify other remediation measures (e.g., firewall or VPN configuration) that must be taken due to system availability requirements, complexity, or heterogeneous devices. In this paper, we introduce vulnerability playbooks based on open standards. Pushing the envelope of cybersecurity playbooks—steps organizations should follow when responding to cybersecurity incidents reactively—for ICS vulnerability management offers organizations a more transparent, repeatable process and faster, possibly automated actions. We have designed a process model to collect and transform security advisories in
              Common Security Advisory Framework
              (CSAF) format and generate
              Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations
              (CACAO) playbooks based on listed remediation advice. With a proof of concept, we demonstrate that structured CSAF documents can be seamlessly transformed into CACAO playbooks. For our industrial use case, we must also use unstructured security advice highlighting quality differences (compared to CSAF). Our generated 79 standard conformant CACAO playbooks with 485 identified actions hint at imbalanced advice toward patching. Preferably, vendors should include detailed technical remediation advice, provide APIs, and go beyond patching recommendations in their security advisories. Subscribers should structure their assets and use machine learning to normalize, generate, and prioritize CACAO playbooks. With CSAF and CACAO, we see two open standards for handling vulnerabilities.},

This paper introduces a multi-disciplinary innovation research approach grounded in a participatory ForSTI (i.e., Foresight in Science, Technology, and Innovation) methodology. We apply a Horizon scanning exercise in combination with expert interviews and a lead user workshop to develop a future humanity-centric roadmap for IEs that aligns with a coherent understanding of human and societal needs. Multiple technical visions are explored to foresee how ethics, human control, and agency can be preserved in developing future human-centric IEs. Our findings indicate that the “feasible” future vision is propelled forward by
              technical enchanted determinism
              , with weak resistance from the public, citizens, and society. The “possible” vision augments humans and the environment through technical advancement. In contrast, the most “desirable” vision is inclusive of all humanity, also the most vulnerable, and can bring forth meaningful human involvement and influence in the technical configurations of IEs. By carefully considering the potential drivers and barriers ahead, we can re-think how to design for the most desirable future vision in developing IEs.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Modern manufacturing has to cope with dynamic and changing circumstances. Market fluctuations, the effects caused by unpredictable material shortages, highly variable product demand, and worker availability all require system robustness, flexibility, and resilience. To adapt to these new requirements, manufacturers should consider investigating, investing in, and implementing system autonomy. Autonomy is being adopted in multiple industrial contexts, but divergences arise when formalizing the concept of autonomous systems. To develop an implementation of autonomous manufacturing systems, it is essential to specify what autonomy means, how autonomous manufacturing systems are different from other autonomous systems, and how autonomous manufacturing systems are identified and achieved through the main features and enabling technologies. With a comprehensive literature review, this paper provides a definition of autonomy in the manufacturing context, infers the features of autonomy from different engineering domains, and presents a five-level model of autonomy — associated with maturity levels for the features — to ensure the complete identification and evaluation of autonomous manufacturing systems. The paper also presents the evaluation of a real autonomous system that serves as a use-case and a validation of the model.},

            Disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major upheavals for manufacturing, and has severe implications for production networks, and the demand and supply chains underpinning manufacturing operations. This paper is the first of its kind to pull together research on both—the pandemic-related challenges and the management interventions in a manufacturing context. This systematic literature review reveals the frailty of supply chains and production networks in withstanding the pressures of lockdowns and other safety protocols, including product and workforce shortages. These, altogether, have led to closed facilities, reduced capacities, increased costs, and severe economic uncertainty for manufacturing businesses. In managing these challenges and stabilising their operations, manufacturers are urgently intervening by—investing in digital technologies, undertaking resource redistribution and repurposing, regionalizing and localizing, servitizing, and targeting policies that can help them survive in this altered economy. Based on holistic analysis of these challenges and interventions, this review proposes an extensive research agenda for future studies to pursue.},

              The seemingly simple step of molding a cholesteric liquid crystal into spherical shape, yielding a
              Cholesteric Spherical Reflector
              (CSR), has profound optical consequences that open a range of opportunities for potentially transformative technologies. The chiral Bragg diffraction resulting from the helical self-assembly of cholesterics becomes omnidirectional in CSRs. This turns them into selective retroreflectors that are exceptionally easy to distinguish—regardless of background—by simple and low-cost machine vision, while at the same time they can be made largely imperceptible to human vision. This allows them to be distributed in human-populated environments, laid out in the form of QR-code-like markers that help robots and Augmented Reality (AR) devices to operate reliably, and to identify items in their surroundings. At the scale of individual CSRs, unpredictable features within each marker turn them into Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), of great value for secure authentication. Via the machines reading them, CSR markers can thus act as trustworthy yet unobtrusive links between the physical world (buildings, vehicles, packaging,…) and its digital twin computer representation. This opens opportunities to address pressing challenges in logistics and supply chain management, recycling and the circular economy, sustainable construction of the built environment, and many other fields of individual, societal and commercial importance.},

Adaptation towards SDG-7, Affordable and Clean Energy, brings in new investments and creates a significant economy around it. While private investments and government spending in developed countries concentrate on achieving efficiency and renewable energy production, developing countries focus on obtaining access to electricity and clean energy sources. This chapter presents the business models of 60 companies and use cases that employ emerging technologies and create value in SDG-7.

              Aim
              The purpose of this review is to examine the applications of novel digital technology domains for the screening and management of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR).
            
            
              Methods
              A PubMed engine search was performed, using the terms “Telemedicine”, “Digital health”, “Telehealth”, “Telescreening”, “Artificial intelligence”, “Deep learning”, “Smartphone”, “Triage”, “Screening”, “Home-based”, “Monitoring”, “Ophthalmology”, “Diabetes”, “Diabetic Retinopathy”, “Retinal imaging”. Full-text English language studies from January 1, 2010, to February 1, 2022, and reference lists were considered for the conceptual framework of this review.
            
            
              Results
              Diabetes mellitus and its eye complications, including DR, are particularly well suited to digital technologies, providing an ideal model for telehealth initiatives and real-world applications. The current development in the adoption of telemedicine, artificial intelligence and remote monitoring as an alternative to or in addition to traditional forms of care will be discussed.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Advances in digital health have created an ecosystem ripe for telemedicine in the field of DR to thrive. Stakeholders and policymakers should adopt a participatory approach to ensure sustained implementation of these technologies after the COVID-19 pandemic.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Current research on trend detection in artificial intelligence (AI) mainly concerns academic data sources and industrial applications of AI. However, we argue that industrial trends are influenced by public perception and political decisions (e.g., through industry subsidies and grants) and should be reflected in political data sources. To investigate this hypothesis, we examine the AI trend development in German business and politics from 1998 to 2020. Therefore, we propose a web mining approach to collect a novel data set consisting of business and political data sources combining 1.07 million articles and documents. We identify 246 AI-related buzzwords extracted from various glossaries. We use them to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. This study successfully detects an AI trend and follows its evolution in business and political data sources over the past two decades. Moreover, we find a faster adoption of AI in business than in politics, with a considerable increase in policy discourse in recent years. Finally, we show that the collected data can be used for trend detection besides AI-related topics using topic clustering and the COVID-19 pandemic as examples.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper proposes a general approach for using conversational interfaces such as chatbots to offer adaptive learning of business processes in an environment involving different actors. Adaptivity concerns both the content being proposed, the sequence of learning items, and the way the conversation is conducted. The original approach allows the development of sustainable chatbots and empowers various non-technical actors (authors, teachers, publishers, and learners) to control the chatbot features directly. The aCHAT-WF framework (adaptive CHATbot for WorkFlows), proposed in this paper for managing conversational interfaces, conceptually represents all the aspects related to a conversation about business processes, with different facets for the user, the conversation flow, and the conversation contents, combining them to obtain a flexible interaction with the user. The paper focuses on the different preparation phases for instructional material based on Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) models, separating the different roles involved in the construction of a chatbot for teaching business processes and with the possibility of defining different styles for the interaction with the users. The proposed method is configuration-driven, to facilitate the separation of the different aspects of the control of the interaction and the delivery of contents.},

              Background
              In the future, extended reality technology will be widely used. People will be led to utilize virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in their daily lives, hobbies, numerous types of entertainment, and employment. Medical augmented reality has evolved with applications ranging from medical education to picture-guided surgery. Moreover, a bulk of research is focused on clinical applications, with the majority of research devoted to surgery or intervention, followed by rehabilitation and treatment applications. Numerous studies have also looked into the use of augmented reality in medical education and training.
            
            
              Methods
              Using the databases Semantic Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect, a scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. To find other articles, a manual search was also carried out in Google Scholar. This study presents studies carried out over the previous 14 years (from 2009 to 2023) in detail. We classify this area of study into the following categories: (1) AR and VR in surgery, which is presented in the following subsections: subsection A: MR in neurosurgery; subsection B: spine surgery; subsection C: oral and maxillofacial surgery; and subsection D: AR-enhanced human-robot interaction; (2) AR and VR in medical education presented in the following subsections; subsection A: medical training; subsection B: schools and curriculum; subsection C: XR in Biomedicine; (3) AR and VR for rehabilitation presented in the following subsections; subsection A: stroke rehabilitation during COVID-19; subsection B: cancer and VR, and (4) Millimeter-wave and MIMO systems for AR and VR.
            
            
              Results
              
                In total, 77 publications were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Four distinct AR and/or VR applications groups could be differentiated: AR and VR in surgery (
                N
                = 21), VR and AR in Medical Education (
                N
                = 30), AR and VR for Rehabilitation (
                N
                = 15), and Millimeter-Wave and MIMO Systems for AR and VR (
                N
                = 7), where
                N
                is number of cited studies. We found that the majority of research is devoted to medical training and education, with surgical or interventional applications coming in second. The research is mostly focused on rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical applications. Moreover, the application of XR in MIMO has been the subject of numerous research.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Examples of these diverse fields of applications are displayed in this review as follows: (1) augmented reality and virtual reality in surgery; (2) augmented reality and virtual reality in medical education; (3) augmented reality and virtual reality for rehabilitation; and (4) millimeter-wave and MIMO systems for augmented reality and virtual reality.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            To assure certain critical quality properties (e.g., safety, security, or privacy), supervisory authorities and industrial associations provide reference frameworks such as standards or guidelines that in some cases are enforced (e.g., regulations). Given the pace at which both technical advancements and risks appear, there is an increase in the number of reference frameworks. As several frameworks might apply for same systems, certain overlaps appear (e.g., regulations for different countries where the system will operate, or generic standards in conjunction with more concrete standards for a given industrial sector or system type). We propose the use of modelling for alleviating the complexity of these reference frameworks ecosystems, and we provide a tool-supported method to create them for the benefit of different stakeholders. The case study is based on privacy data protection, and more concretely on privacy impact assessment processes. The European GDPR regulates the movement and processing of personal data, and, contrary to available software engineering privacy guidelines, articles in legal texts are usually difficult to translate to the underlying processes, artefacts and roles that they refer to. To facilitate the mutual comprehension of legal experts and engineers, in this work we investigate how mappings can be created between these two domains of expertise. Notably, we rely on modelling as a central point. We modelled the legal requirements of the GDPR on data protection impact assessments, and then, we selected the ISO/IEC 29134, a mainstream engineering guideline for privacy impact assessment, and, taking a concrete sector as example, the EU Smart Grid Data Protection Impact Assessment template. The OpenCert tool was used for providing technical support to both the modelling and the creation of the mapping models in a systematic way. We provide a qualitative evaluation from legal experts and privacy engineering practitioners to report on the benefits and limitations of this approach.},

              Sustainability has entered all aspects of life, calling for an active approach from the wireless and mobile communications community to help in solving fundamental challenges facing societies. Societal, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainability have become increasingly important design criteria in developing future technologies, along with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework that sets specific goals and targets to be achieved by 2030. The role of mobile communications is important in supporting nations and organizations in meeting the UN SDGs in a timely manner, but the whole ICT sector itself, with its critical role as the backbone of society, can create a significant sustainability burden. Research on the next-generation mobile communication networks (6G) has started, aiming at first deployments in 2030, in a new era where sustainability defines its development. Therefore, sustainability, especially through the UN SDGs, and the future 6G wireless networks, cannot be treated in isolation, but a clear connection between them is urgently needed. This paper extends from traditional green communications and energy efficiency considerations in wireless communications to establishing a close connection between 6G and the triple bottom line of
              economic
              sustainability,
              societal
              sustainability, and
              environmental
              sustainability. The paper outlines open research challenges for sustainable 6G development and provides a set of research questions encouraging especially the researchers and engineers in the wireless and mobile communications community to address to realize a sustainable future.},

            The digital transformation process is creating a system of new digital technologies that will give rise to an autonomous ecosystem capable of predicting and determining what will happen in the physical world. The digital twin seen as a moment of creation of a self-named digital model (digital alter ego) and guided in its design by an artificial intelligence can be a source of concern, questioning the central role of the person and of his intelligence in the creative process. The most important problems are: Artificial intelligence capacity to extend its capabilities in a unpredictable way and the inability to understand how artificial intelligence builds its solutions. After hinting at the roots of this problems, we will introduce co-creation as a new way of conceiving the collaboration between the human being and artificial intelligence. Co-creation requires to solve the problems outlined above and this could perhaps define new frontiers of creativity.},

            Nations and cities are eagerly joining the global trend of transition to digitized society. Through digitalization, societies aim to streamline their key functions and to develop modern services to inhabitants. 5G wireless networks are being built globally with lots of expectations put on them. It is anticipated that at the first phase of 5G, the technology will benefit the most different verticals like factories, hospitals and campuses. Universities have likewise awoken to establish digitalization projects to respond to the disruption of education and to overcome in the growing global competition. The transition to digital campus will inevitably rely on campus ICT and IoT infrastructures. Additionally, the number of terminals, devices, sensors and robots will multiply. This article proposes a technical architecture for future Smart Campus consisting of 5G and IoT networks complemented by distributed computing and data analytics. Increasing complexity of digital environment calls for a specific actor to operate the Smart Campus infrastructure and also services, which has not been widely discussed. It is foreseen that the university IT Administration is probably not willing to adopt the responsibility of enlarging infra and growing number of devices. Similarly, mobile network operators are not seen appropriate to take this role being commonly profiled to offer merely connectivity. To tackle this question, a novel operational model for the Smart Campuses is presented based on the recently proposed micro operator concept. Moreover, a case study of the University of Oulu campus is presented, where smart technology in the form of 5G test network has been deployed.},

            To enable sound scientific research in future energy informatics projects, it is necessary to obtain an overview of the current state of the research field to identify unaddressed gaps and challenges. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the research trends and achievements within energy informatics in a Danish context within the last three decades. This paper reviews 207 energy informatics projects collected until the second quarter of 2022. Quantitative analysis results show that most projects have focused on applying energy informatics through energy-aware control of end-user consumption. The qualitative review finds an emphasis on data usage and end-users which aligns with the quantitative review. Furthermore, it tends to focus on specific end-users, e.g., buildings and heat pumps. Four overall recommendations are established: (I) Increased emphasis on research for sector coupling to aid in unlocking energy system flexibility, (II) project data value chain output, focusing on structuring and managing the data to make it applicable for future re-use, (III) utilizing industrial loads and incorporating an end-user perspective, (IV) inclusion of research institutions for the improved overall output of the projects through interdisciplinary solutions.},

            Digital transformation is of crucial importance in the manufacturing industry, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic because of the increasing need for remote working and socially distanced workplaces. However, there is a lack of a clear and well-defined process to implement digital transformation in manufacturing. This paper aims to identify the most critical stages to implementing digital transformation in the manufacturing sector. Twenty-one structured interviews with experienced specialists in digitalisation in the manufacturing sector in the Egyptian economy were held and used the Best–Worst Method to analyse the data as an analysis tool for a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. The digital transformation process comprises eight stages covering technology, management, communications, and customer elements. The main contribution of this work stage is the balance between the different elements of digital transformation—digital technologies, leadership and strategy, people and business processes—to create an integrated 8-step process of digital transformation in the manufacturing sector of developing economies such as the Egyptian economy.},

            Technical standards in digital technology can now be utilised to gather numerous digital sub-universes into the metaverse. However, how to create and implement guidance for the metaverse based on technical standards remains unexplored. This study investigated the theoretical framework and policy implications for future technical standards-based metaverse governance (TS-MG). The methodology entailed reviewing the available metaverse governance literature to establish both theoretical and case analyses of practices based on the economics of standards and the theory of networks. This study found that TS-MG encompasses the formulation, security, and compatibility of technical standards. TS-MG should enable the first-mover advantage of standards formulation for standard-setting organisations. It also includes phased governance policies that balance the compatibility and security of standards in the initial, growth, and mature stages of the metaverse. This study highlights the necessity of cooperation among governments, standard-setting organisations, and enterprises to (1) accelerate the development of systemised standards and (2) promote the effective supply of metaverse standards.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Purpose
              European Extended Reality (XR) industry is expected to significantly increase by 2025 with an extreme impact on the Healthcare scenario. Considering that the transition period for the Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (MDR 2017/745) will end in May 2024, purpose of this study is to assess whether the Medical Device Regulatory Compliance is ready to cope with the inclusion of XR and its possible social and economic impact in the world of medical device software (MDSW).
            
            
              Methods
              XR publications patterns were evaluated since MDR 2017/745 release on different databases. European normative about MDSW are consulted, followed by the European Database of Medical Devices (EUDAMED).
            
            
              Results
              The number of publications on XR have increased since 2017 and healthcare is the third highest-impacted subject area. Specific classes for software have been introduces in the European Nomenclature of Medical Devices (EMDN) and some XR applications have already been registered in EUDAMED classified as MDSW.
            
            
              Conclusions
              XR will become intrinsic in everyday medical protocol and guidelines. The establishment of the IEEE Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Working Group and the statement of VR for remoting surgery as a MDSW in MDCG 2019-11 are demonstration of the necessity of MD regulatory compliance in being able to keep up with the upcoming XR technologies. The Authors agree that the competent authorities should consider intervening in the European Regulative Compliance to cope with the revolution of Phygital in Healthcare and to regulate procedures involving the use of XR in medicine preventing future misunderstanding and criticalities especially for high risk situations.},

            The future of work is changing rapidly as result of fast technological developments, decarbonization and social upheavals. Thus, employees need a new skillset to be successful in the future workforce. However, current approaches for the identification of future skills are either based on s small sample of expert opinions or the result of researchers interpreting the results of data-driven approaches and thus not meaningful for the stakeholders. Against this background, we propose a novel process for the identification of future skills incorporating a data-driven approach with expert interviews. This enables identifying future skills that are comprehensive and representative for a whole industry and region as well as meaningful for the stakeholders. We demonstrate the applicability and utility of our process by means of a case study, where we identify 33 future skills for the manufacturing industry in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. Our work contributes to the identification of comprehensive and representative future skills (for whole industries).},

Investment in deep renovation is driven by various rationales, including societal, economic, environmental, energy security, quality, opportunistic, and catalytic motivations and benefits. At the same time, both deep renovation and digital technology adoption to support deep renovation are impacted by challenges presented in humans, organisational processes, technologies and external environments. This chapter explores the key drivers and barriers to deep renovation and associated digitalisation. It establishes the motivation for the remainder of the book.},

            Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to significantly impact transportation systems in terms of mobility, the environment, safety, and the economy. These vehicles rely on a range of sensors and cameras to detect road signs and lane markings, as well as to scan their surroundings, and they are connected to other vehicles and infrastructures. Previous research has highlighted the need for transport asset management processes to manage the intrinsic aspects of CAVs more effectively, with a view to improving performance, resource utilization, and budget planning. However, little literature was found with a deep discussion of how CAVs will impact asset management. In this article we offer an initial discussion on the impacts of CAVs on road asset management. To do so, we first provide a short introduction to CAVs, followed by an overview of road asset management. We then comprehensively discuss many asset management aspects that are affected by CAVs. Finally, future research opportunities, challenges, and important subjects are outlined.},

            There is a consensus that health is a fundamental human right. The extent of the countries seeking to improve the health conditions of their people is one of the indications of sustainable development. Poor health systems jeopardise a country’s citizens’ rights, hinder their involvement in educational programs, limit their ability to participate in economic activities and engage in meaningful work fully and ultimately raise poverty regardless of gender.

            Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative information technologies of our century. Despite high expectations across all industries and corporate functions, companies have difficulties to realize the full potential of AI and struggle to move beyond AI pilots. This article provides empirical evidence from survey data and three case studies to better understand the value drivers of AI. Leading companies specify use cases from a business perspective and leverage domain expertise to tap into value pools by combining technology with human capabilities. They provide fundamental enablers for AI like digital and data platforms, a data-centric organization with solid governance, and a dedicated human resource base to facilitate AI value creation. Moreover, these firms assess the financial and business impact of AI initiatives and reprioritize projects if the expected value does not materialize. Based on these insights, recommendations to better scale and derive value from AI projects will be offered.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The emerging phenomenon of platformization has given rise to what has been termed "platform society,“ a digitally connected world where platforms have penetrated the heart of urban societies—transforming social practices, disrupting social interactions and market relations, and affecting democratic processes. One of the recent manifestations of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform whose data infrastructures, governance models, and economic processes are predicted to penetrate different urban sectors and spheres of urban life. The Metaverse is an idea of a hypothetical set of “parallel virtual worlds” that incarnate ways of living in believably virtual cities as an alternative to future data-driven smart cities. However, this idea has already raised concerns over what constitutes the global architecture of computer mediation underlying the Metaverse with regard to different forms of social life as well as social order. This study analyzes the core emerging trends enabling and driving data-driven smart cities and uses the outcome to devise a novel framework for the digital and computing processes underlying the Metaverse as a virtual form of data-driven smart cities. Further, it examines and discusses the risks and impacts of the Metaverse, paying particular attention to: platformization; the COVID-19 crisis and the ensuing non-spontaneous "normality" of social order; corporate-led technocratic governance; governmentality; privacy, security, and trust; and data governance. A thematic analysis approach is adopted to cope with the vast body of literature of various disciplinarities. The analysis identifies five digital and computing processes related to data-driven smart cities: digital instrumentation, digital hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization. The novelty of the framework derived based on thematic analysis lies in its essential processual digital and computing components and the way in which these are structured and integrated given their clear synergies as to enabling the functioning of the Metaverse towards potentially virtual cities. This study highlights how and why the identified digital and computing processes—as intricately interwoven with the entirety of urban ways of living—arouse contentions and controversies pertaining to society’ public values. As such, it provides new insights into understanding the complex interplay between the Metaverse as a form of science and technology and the other dimensions of society. Accordingly, it contributes to the scholarly debates in the field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) by highlighting the societal and ethical implications of the platformization of urban societies through the Metaverse.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            On the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, high-risk and vulnerable groups in the population were at particular risk of severe disease progression. Pregnant women were one of these groups. The infectious disease endangered not only the physical health of pregnant women, but also their mental well-being. Improving the mental health of pregnant women and reducing their risk of an infectious disease could be achieved by using remote home monitoring solutions. These would allow the health of the mother and fetus to be monitored from the comfort of their home, a reduction in the number of physical visits to the doctor and thereby eliminate the need for the mother to venture into high-risk public places. The most commonly used technique in clinical practice, cardiotocography, suffers from low specificity and requires skilled personnel for the examination. For that and due to the intermittent and active nature of its measurements, it is inappropriate for continuous home monitoring. The pandemic has demonstrated that the future lies in accurate remote monitoring and it is therefore vital to search for an option for fetal monitoring based on state-of-the-art technology that would provide a safe, accurate, and reliable information regarding fetal and maternal health state. In this paper, we thus provide a technical and critical review of the latest literature and on this topic to provide the readers the insights to the applications and future directions in fetal monitoring. We extensively discuss the remaining challenges and obstacles in future research and in developing the fetal monitoring in the new era of Fetal monitoring 4.0, based on the pillars of Healthcare 4.0.},

            Industry 4.0 has started to transform the manufacturing industries by embracing digitalization, automation, and big data, aiming for interconnected systems, autonomous decisions, and smart factories. Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), have emerged as potent tools to address the related computational tasks. These advancements have also reached the pharmaceutical industry, where the Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative has already paved the way for the real-time analysis of the processes and the science- and risk-based flexible production. This paper aims to assess the potential of ANNs within the PAT concept to aid the modernization of pharmaceutical manufacturing. The current state of ANNs is systematically reviewed for the most common manufacturing steps of solid pharmaceutical products, and possible research gaps and future directions are identified. In this way, this review could aid the further development of machine learning techniques for pharmaceutical production and eventually contribute to the implementation of intelligent manufacturing lines with automated quality assurance.

            Through the lens of the stock market, we examine whether and how the cloud economy affects China’s economy. We review the literature on cloud computing and related concepts and propose a definition of the cloud economy. Based on this new definition, we create a China Cloud Economy Index (CCEI) and its sub-indices. Using stock market data from 2012 to 2020, we analyze the basic characteristics of these indices, their validity, and their relationship with the overall stock market. The robustness of the new index is also examined. We find that the relationship between the CCEI and the stock market had been getting stronger but weakened somewhat after January 11, 2019 plausibly because of the availability of recent cloud-related policies that have widened the gap between the market performance of CCEI and that of the stock market.},

            This study aims to investigate the factors that influence the willingness of highway construction enterprises in China to adopt intelligent construction technology. Based on the existing literature, a TOSE framework was proposed, and four dimensions and 15 hypothesized influencing factors were identified through expert interviews. By using a combination of PLS-SEM and ANN, 513 survey data were analyzed to determine the linear and non-linear relationships of the influencing factors on the willingness to adopt. The results showed that all 14 hypothesized factors had varying degrees of positive or negative effects on the willingness to adopt, except for organizational culture, which was found to have no significant impact. Specifically, technology cost was found to be the most influential negative factor, while market demand and organizational structure were the most influential positive factors. The findings of this study have important reference value for decision makers and participants in highway construction enterprises, as well as other construction companies when considering the adoption of smart construction technologies. The originality of this research lies in the novel application of the TOSE framework to investigate smart construction technology adoption, and the combined use of PLS-SEM and ANN to examine both linear and nonlinear relationships between variables for the first time.},

            In the recent years, the copy detection patterns (CDP) attracted a lot of attention as a link between the physical and digital worlds, which is of great interest for the internet of things and brand protection applications. However, the security of CDP in terms of their reproducibility by unauthorized parties or clonability remains largely unexplored. In this respect, this paper addresses a problem of anti-counterfeiting of physical objects and aims at investigating the authentication aspects and the resistances to illegal copying of the modern CDP from machine learning perspectives. A special attention is paid to a reliable authentication under the real-life verification conditions when the codes are printed on an industrial printer and enrolled via modern mobile phones under regular light conditions. The theoretical and empirical investigation of authentication aspects of CDP is performed with respect to four types of copy fakes from the point of view of (i) multi-class supervised classification as a baseline approach and (ii) one-class classification as a real-life application case. The obtained results show that the modern machine-learning approaches and the technical capacities of modern mobile phones allow to reliably authenticate CDP on end-user mobile phones under the considered classes of fakes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The literature on the modeling and management of data generated through the lifecycle of a manufacturing system is split into two main paradigms: product lifecycle management (PLM) and product, process, resource (PPR) modeling. These paradigms are complementary, and the latter could be considered a more neutral version of the former. There are two main technologies associated with these paradigms: ontologies and databases. Database technology is widespread in industry and is well established. Ontologies remain largely a plaything of the academic community which, despite numerous projects and publications, have seen limited implementations in industrial manufacturing applications. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comparison between ontologies and databases, offering both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the context of PLM and PPR. To achieve this, the article presents (1) a literature review within the context of manufacturing systems that use databases and ontologies, identifying their respective strengths and weaknesses, and (2) an implementation in a real industrial scenario that demonstrates how different modeling approaches can be used for the same purpose. This experiment is used to enable discussion and comparative analysis of both modeling strategies.},

            Models are the key tools humans use to manage complexity in description, development, and analysis. This applies to all scientific and engineering disciplines and in particular to the development of software and data-intensive systems. However, different methods and terminologies have become established in the individual disciplines, even in the sub-fields of Informatics, which raises the need for a comprehensive and cross-sectional analysis of the past, present, and future of modeling research. This paper aims to shed some light on how different modeling disciplines emerged and what characterizes them with a discussion of the potential toward a common modeling future. It focuses on the areas of software, data, and process modeling and reports on an analysis of the research approaches, goals, and visions pursued in each, as well as the methods used. This analysis is based on the results of a survey conducted in the communities concerned, on a bibliometric study, and on interviews with a prominent representative of each of these communities. The paper discusses the different viewpoints of the communities, their commonalities and differences, and identifies possible starting points for further collaboration. It further discusses current challenges for the communities in general and modeling as a research topic in particular and highlights visions for the future.},

            Industrial collaborative robotics is promising for manufacturing activities where the presence of a robot alongside a human operator can improve operator’s working conditions, flexibility, and productivity. A collaborative robotic application has to guarantee not only safety of the human operator, but also fluency in the collaboration, as well as performance in terms of productivity and task time. In this paper, we present an approach to enhance fluency and productivity in human-robot collaboration through online scaling of dynamic safety zones. A supervisory controller runs online safety checks between bounding volumes enclosing robot and human to identify possible collision dangers. To optimize the sizes of safety zones enclosing the manipulator, the method minimizes the time of potential stop trajectories considering the robot dynamics and its torque constraints, and leverages the directed speed of the robot parts with respect to the human. Simulations and experimental tests on a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic arm verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and collaborative fluency metrics show the benefits of the method with respect to existing approaches.},

            The current digital transformation of many businesses and the exponential growth of digital data are two of the key factors of digital revolution. For the successful meeting of high expectations, the data platforms need to employ the recent theoretical, technological, and methodological advances in contemporary computing and data science and engineering. This chapter presents an approach to address these challenges by combining logical methods for knowledge processing and machine learning methods for data analysis into a hybrid AI-based framework. It is applicable to a wide range of problems that involve both synchronous operations and asynchronous events in different domains. The framework is a foundation for building the GATE Data Platform, which aims at the application of Big Data technologies in civil and government services, industry, and healthcare. The platform implementation will utilize several recent distributed technologies such as Internet of Things, cloud, and edge computing and will integrate them into a multilevel service-oriented architecture that supports services along the entire data value chain, while the service orchestration guarantees a high degree of interoperability, reusability, and automation. The platform is designed to be compliant with the open-source software, but its open architecture supports also mixing with commercial components and tools.},

              The energy industry in Norway has a long tradition in using information technology to enable integrated operations, namely, remote collaboration between personnel at offshore installations and experts at onshore office environments. Currently, the industry is undergoing a digital transformation in which remote operations of unmanned offshore assets are the emerging standard. To ensure trustworthy and reliable operations, offshore remote sensing capabilities must be established through not only technical means but also a broader transformation involving new competence, work processes, and governance principles. In this chapter, we reconstruct this transformation and ask:
              What are the emerging capabilities that develop around the remote operation digital infrastructure?
              We unpack how the new digital infrastructure is a continuation of the practices and systems that have been established over time. We use historical reconstruction with vignettes from the development of a new generation of remotely operated offshore installations in oil and gas and wind facilities to describe the ongoing digital transformation as a process of infrastructuring in which the infrastructure gets increasingly entangled with internal and external systems, stakeholders, and agendas. In doing so, we shed light on how the established local and situated solutions evolve and are compensated for through the technical and organizational principles of the emerging information infrastructure.},

            This chapter introduces the evolution of mobile communications. As the mobile communications’ context is expected to become increasingly platform-based and ecosystemic, it is important to distinguish relevant perspectives and map the developments in the field. This chapter provides an outlook from the first (1G) to fifth (5G) generation of mobile communications by looking at technology and standardization, relevant regulatory developments and contents, and specifically characterizes the business ecosystems toward the sixth generation of mobile communications (6G). The purpose of the chapter is to provide a contextual setting for the discussions presented in the subsequent chapters by showing the emergence and evolutionary continuum of mobile communications from 1 to 6G.},

            Business models in mobile communication have remained surprisingly stable up to 4G. 5G and beyond generations will bring a fundamental change to how mobile connectivity is deployed and commercialized. This chapter explores value capture on 5G and 6G by looking at the business opportunities, business models, and changing platform-based business ecosystems of the future that extend beyond traditional company boundaries. Combining technology and strategy perspectives, six baseline business models are presented for 5G: General bit-pipe, Segmented specialized service, Wholesale service local operator, Retail service local operator, Vertical service operator, and Context service local operator. Additionally, 6GMNO, OTT operator, Edge operator, Telco broker, and Service-flow business models are envisioned for 6G. The chapter concludes by characterizing the future mobile communications business models as vertically, horizontally, or obliquely structured ecosystems.},

            In the last few years, the potential impact of big data on the manufacturing industry has received enormous attention. This chapter details two large-scale trials that have been implemented in the context of the lighthouse project Boost 4.0. The chapter introduces the Boost 4.0 Reference Model, which adapts the more generic BDVA big data reference architectures to the needs of Industry 4.0. The Boost 4.0 reference model includes a reference architecture for the design and implementation of advanced big data pipelines and the digital factory service development reference architecture. The engineering and management of business network track and trace processes in high-end textile supply are explored with a focus on the assurance of Preferential Certification of Origin (PCO). Finally, the main findings from these two large-scale piloting activities in the area of service engineering are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The built environment fundamentally suffers from organisational fragmentation in various aspects, such as data flow, finance, and supply chains. Blockchain technology can be considered a transformative solution to the inherent fragmentation of this industry. This chapter first defines the basics of blockchain technology to show how a peer-to-peer network could enable a decentralised, traceable, and immutable information system across the life cycles of built assets. Then, an overview of blockchain literature within the context of a circular economy, with real-life examples and the current state of blockchain adoption in the circular built environment, is presented, and the role that this technology plays in addressing certain circular strategies is discussed. Afterward, implementation challenges and incentives are identified to set realistic expectations regarding the capabilities of blockchain technologies. Emerging concepts within blockchain technologies are then presented to give insights into prospects beyond current literature and use cases in the circular built environment. Finally, the future of blockchain technology in a circular built environment is discussed to present the applicability of blockchain and its possible integration with other emerging digitalisation tools, such as building information modelling (BIM) and material passports, in wider domains of circular, smart cities and communities.},

            This chapter explores the opportunities for value creation via the services enabled by the fifth (5G) and sixth (6G) generation of mobile communications. The chapter starts with a discussion on value creation in general and discusses value creation at service, platform, and ecosystem levels of analysis. We present the 5G and 6G usage cases as starting points and highlight the drivers of value creation and the key services enabled by the mobile communications technology generations. In 5G, the focus is on deployments of public commercial networks, public commercial virtual networks, neutral hosts, private local networks operated by MNOs, private local networks operated by others than MNOs, and public network integrated non-public networks. In 6G, the focus is on new capability usage case candidates that will be represented by immersive communications, connecting intelligence, sensing for sustainability, and connecting the unconnected.},

            The Big Data Value contractual Public-Private Partnership between the European Commission and the Big Data Value Association (BDVA) was signed in October 2014. Since then, more than 50 projects and numerous BDVA members have explored how data can drive innovation across the data stack and how industries can transform business practices. Meanwhile, start-ups have been working at the confluence of new sources of data (e.g. IoT, DNA, HD pictures, satellite data) and new or revisited processing paradigms (e.g. Edge computing, blockchain, machine learning) to tackle new use cases and to provide disruptive solutions for known problems. This chapter details a collection of stories showing concrete examples of the value created thanks to a renewed usage of data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Previous energy transformations have been driven by the exploitation of a new energy resource. In contrast, although the digitalization of energy is delivering cost reductions in the supply and transportation of energy; digitalization is truly transformational because it brings the demand side into play, facilitating the move to a more integrated, highly flexible and customer-centric energy system which will ultimately unlock deep decarbonization of our societies. This fertile new energy landscape will be dominated by data-rich organizations able to establish direct relationships with consumers, resulting in the provision of new services which enable the integration of energy consumption with weather-dependent renewable production. Much of the focus is on the intelligent management of demand and supply from connected buildings and electric vehicles, leading to a proliferation of new business models. This increased connectivity comes with risks: increased danger of cybersecurity attacks and disruption of existing business relationships, staffing and organizational structures and a re-positioning of the role of the customer at the heart of the system. This commercial disruption is inherent to the digital transformation of the energy sector: an essential step in the transition to a carbon-neutral global economy.},

            In a digitalized and deeply interconnected industrial ecosystem, it is of paramount importance to create mechanisms that seamlessly guarantee standardization and verifiability, interoperability (including regional legislation), transparency, and trustworthiness, in particular in the intermediation of all businesses and stakeholders, including SMEs. In this respect, the International Data Spaces and GAIA-X initiatives pave the way to a framework for collaboration that use secure and trusted data services to safeguard digital sovereignty.
            Huawei is a leading ICT provider, operating in more than 170 countries, and an active member of more than 600 standardization bodies and industry associations, among them IDS and GAIA-X. With their international footprint, IDS and GAIA-X are of the utmost importance for Huawei in Germany, Europe, and globally. Here, we provide a brief overview of our understanding of the data ecosystem’s inherent issues, and how regulations address them, followed by more specific examples of how IDS and GAIA-X objectives can be supported by Huawei, with emphasis on validating concepts in the manufacturing domain as a prominent reference example for an important European market vertical. We illustrate the use case of an evolved implementation of Industry 4.0 that integrates machines and cloud services. 5G connectivity for trusted networked production is added to the example. We finally highlight the use of GAIA-X compliant federated AI for control, maintenance, and match-making of demand and supply actors.},

            Emerging technologies can be defined as a set of technologies whose development and application areas are still expanding rapidly, and their technical and value potential is still largely unrealised. Naturally, this leads to a vivid innovation environment for these technologies. In this book, tech-savvy people can easily read and understand the working principles of 34 different emerging technologies. And then, they can see in what areas these technologies are used and how they can create value. Moreover, the book starts with an “Innovation Journey” chapter. This chapter focuses on innovation and how ideas are converted into value and business. By value, we mean monetary, environmental and social value. In addition, for entrepreneurs and start-ups, we also show the funding and financing mechanisms for innovative ideas.},
