abstract = {Abstract The complexity of industrial challenges is emerging together with the exponentially developing information and communication technologies (ICT) that provide several implementation approaches for systems engineering. It is difficult for a single company to follow technological development and remain a pioneer in every topic. Still, the industrial challenges require experts in each technology. Therefore, collaboration among technology providers is an opportunity to gather all resources and competences needed for full delivery. A joint offering (JO) is a solution, that is, co-created in collaboration between two or more actors that usually have complementary technological skills or value-creation logics. A JO has several doubts relating to the use case (UC) in hand, the feasibility of the joint solution to be co-created, the resources and skills needed to deliver the joint solution, the partners, the business value creation, the elements of the contract and the ownership of the outcome, just to mention a few. The Joint Offering Evaluation Framework (JOEF) uncovers these issues and supports decision-making before the development of a JO starts. The JOEF comprises the Joint Offering Playbook and the Business Value Toolset (BVT). The Playbook offers seven viewpoints with checklists and tools for IT solution providers considering collaboration and co-creation for a solution that they cannot deliver or sell alone. The BVT evaluates and illustrates the business value of a JO from the viewpoints of both creation and delivery, together with value capture and assessment. The JOEF was piloted with a digital twin (DT) UC from the pulp and paper industry.},

abstract = {Abstract An observed increase in systems scale and complexity has led to a significant momentum in exploring, identifying, and adopting model based systems engineering (MBSE) tools and techniques amongst research communities and industry practitioners. Several attempts to transform systems design and engineering practices through the use of MBSE in academia and industry has led to a considerable increase in the number of articles published containing the keyword “MBSE.” This growth serves as the motivation in this paper to explore the MBSE landscape with the help of text mining techniques to identify the most often used key terms, tools, and languages, in the context of research in MBSE and the thematic aspects defining the use of MBSE by researchers and practitioners. The objective of this paper is to provide a structured comprehensive overview of research contributions across the MBSE landscape by employing text mining techniques for: (a) identifying the concepts and methodologies inferred upon in relation to MBSE, and (b) classifying the literature published to identify commonalities across academic researchers and practitioners using MBSE tools and methods. For this purpose, the abstracts of 2380 relevant articles published in the period of the last two decades from five different databases are mined. It is found that the terms “SysML,” “Cyber Physical Systems,” and “Production” are the most used terms among researchers across the MBSE landscape with SysML being the most widely used modeling language. Further, six major thematic topics are identified that classify articles from over the last two decades with an increasing interest observed in the use of MBSE to support manufacturing and production engineering activities, especially in the cyber physical systems domain. The contributions of this paper provide a leeway on using text mining techniques to understand the research directions that are currently of interest in the field of MBSE and thereby identify potential future research directions.},

The definition and organization of the functions of the human operators and the HICPS are important steps in the design process, but the design of the interface, external representation of the Common Workspace, and thus support of the cooperative activity are also a crucial step to the success of the new HICPS.}

The digital twin historic landscape street has the performance advantages of virtual reality integration, real-time interaction, independent iteration, and dynamic perception. Taking the historical district of Yu Garden in Shanghai as an example, this paper builds a travel simulation model of the historical district based on the basic elements of the scene service of the digital twin district under the empowerment of “cloud, data and intelligence”. With the digital twin lamps as the physical entity, the passenger flow dynamic simulation data model is constructed. The effectiveness of the model was verified through simulation of the impact of passenger flow changes on passenger flow, and improvements and enhancements were made to smart lighting fixtures in the block. This study explores the rich application scenarios of digital twin historic blocks and creates a scenario-based service model, which will fully activate various online and offline elements of historic landscape blocks, bringing users a brand-new immersive experience.}

abstract = {Abstract In this work, we present a cloud-based digital twin for monitoring of a clamping technology for machining of composite parts. Supporting large and/or freeform composite parts is crucial to avoid bending during drilling. Bending of the part will lead to delamination and frayed edges of the drilled holes. The new active clamping technology allows to realise a stabilised fixture, localised in the area where the drilling occurs, to avoid bending. This significantly improves the quality of the drilled holes. The clamping device is equipped with an IoT edge device, with a bidirectional communication to the cloud. The cloud-based digital twin analyses the quality of the drilled holes based on computer vision, monitors the drill wear and detects incorrect operation of the active clamping device. All data is stored in the cloud. By means of a knowledge graph, which acquires and integrates information into an ontology and provides a central information access, it will be easier for a data scientist to query this data and to gain new insights in the operation of the drill with active clamping device. The full deployment occurs on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This transforms the standard machine into an Industry 4.0 compliant machine.},

abstract = {Summary Digital twin network (DTN) is a foremost enabler for efficient optimization in modern networks, as it owns massive real-time data and requires interaction with the physical network in real-time. When constructing a DTN, it is necessary to deploy many servers in the physical network for digital models' storage, calculation, and communication. Evolutionary algorithms show outstanding global optimization capabilities compared to the constructive heuristic method in such an optimization problem. However, due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the complicated evaluation of the deployment plan, evolutionary algorithms easily fall into the optimum local at a high computational cost, given that the server placement problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this research, we propose an evolutionary framework for server layout optimization that significantly improves the optimization efficiency of evolutionary algorithms and reduces the algorithm's computational cost. An offline-learning-based approach is used to reduce the search space, and a self-examining guided local search method is proposed to improve the search efficiency. Additionally, a look-up table-based hybrid approach is used for solution evaluation, reducing computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed framework and optimization strategy can significantly improve the evolutionary algorithm search efficiency and achieve excellent convergence performance.},

The reader may ponder about the amorphous questions or wonder in confusion. We disrupt the status quo and indulge in orthogonal, nonlinear, and asymmetric information arbitrage which may not be correct. This is a seed, sterile unless cultivated. We aspire to inform that tools and data related to the affluent world are not a template to be “copied” or applied to systems in the remaining (80\%) parts of the world which suffer from economic constraints. We need different thinking that resists the inclination of the affluent 20\% of the world to treat the rest of the world (80\% of the population) as a market. The 80/20 concept evokes the Pareto [1] theme in P3 and the implication is that ideas may float between (porous) the 80/20 domains (partition).}

Therefore, the advanced technologies like machine learning (ML), block chain, and Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing 6G network are leveraged to develop cost-efficient mechanisms to address the issues of excess communication overhead in the present state of the art. Initially, the authors discussed the key vision of 6G communication technologies, its core technologies (such as visible light communication [VLC] and THz), and the existing issues with the existing network generations (such as 5G and 4G). A detailed analysis of benefits, challenges, and applications of blockchain-enabled IoT devices with application verticals like Smart city, smart factory plus, automation, and XR that form the key highlights for 6G wireless communication network is also presented. In addition, the key applications and latest research of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G are discussed facilitating the dynamic spectrum allocation mechanism and mobile edge computing.

Currently, it expands well beyond manufacturing, affecting many areas of life and posing implications for all types of business. This paper focuses on the relationships between Industry 4.0 and Healthcare which transitions to increased interconnectivity, automation and smart decision making. The integration context of Industry 4.0 into Healthcare is only partly understood. Little was done until now to consolidate what is known on the integration benefits and the challenges. This article reports results of a systematic mapping study that analysed 69 papers to extract knowledge about the concepts of Industry 4.0 and the emerging Healthcare 4.0., and the relationships between them. We found 10 different perspectives of Healthcare 4.0, ranging from strategic to tactical and operational levels. Next, our results show: (i) nine applications of Industry 4.0 in the Healthcare domain: Augmented Reality and Simulation, Autonomous Robotics, Cybersecurity, Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing and Systems Integration; and (ii) 10 benefits and nine challenges in Healthcare 4.0. The most frequently mentioned benefits are patients' diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and financial benefits. The most researched challenges are data fragmentation, heterogeneity, complexity, and privacy.},

abstract = {Abstract With implementing cyber-physical systems, modern power systems are at continuous risk of cyber-attacks. Sensor data that is communicated through the communication links is the most vulnerable entity. The attacker breaches the confidentiality of the data and affects the controller's performance, destabilizing the system. This article proposes a neural network-based cyber-attack detection and mitigation scheme to detect and mitigate false data injection attacks on the sensors. Neural networks are used to predict duty; a combination of a data sampler and binary attack detector detects the presence of an attack. Attack mitigation is performed in the final step by analysing the outputs of prediction and detection networks. The designed control scheme is demonstrated at the DC–DC converter level by considering the synchronous boost converter as a plant with an input voltage sensor, output voltage sensor, input current sensor, and output current sensor. The shallow neural network model is trained with appropriate hyperparameters to obtain a root mean square error of 0.003. The control scheme is designed and implemented in MATLAB Simulink platform and realized in real-time hardware setup by deploying the neural network into the microcontroller and its results are explored.}

abstract = {Summary Systems engineers may need to adjust their thinking and adapt to a new problem set injected into society as a result of changes to the system or disruptive events. Changes can include: change in user needs; system mission changes; competition and teaming changes; and changing threat performance. Disruptions may also cause the systems engineer to adapt in the environment and workplace such as disruptions in technology, processes, and people-system interfaces. Future systems engineering efforts may be applied to different domains other than the traditional defense and aerospace projects. These include healthcare, transportation, environment, cybersecurity and Internet of Things, and manufacturing. Systems engineers may need to reconsider the traditional modality of their education. Some of these areas for consideration are core systems engineering topics, systems thinking, and the transdisciplinary development of ideas.}

abstract = {Summary Metaverse is an innovative variant of information and communication application, a sociological structure that combines a number of recent techniques (block chain, industrial IoT, artificial intelligence, deep learning, etc.) to create immersive virtual reality practices and hence establish a link between the biological and simulated worlds. The objective of the industrial metaverse is to speed up procedures such as repair and maintenance, establishing new production lines, remote monitoring, navigation system, and new consumer orientation. Metaverse technology, sometimes known as the digital twin of a workplace, provides immersive experience to the configuration layers of internet networks. Despite the fact that the framework and technologies are not yet in order to permit the widespread development of new immersive virtual environments that human avatars might traverse across platforms, academics are becoming more focused on the metaverse's potential for transformation. By integrating the enlightened narratives and multi-perspective methodology from researchers with diverse fields of knowledge on various facets of the metaverse and its revolutionary influence, this study investigates these issues in depth. The current study has been carried out to examine and pinpoint the possibilities of this developing technology in the industrial sector in perspective of the development of Metaverse technology and the significance of applying it in industry and supply chain.}

abstract = {Summary Among the new requirements needed in industry are the digitalization, automation, and fast measurements that are becoming extremely important in this era of digital manufacturing. In the digitalization of the economy, metrology plays a fundamental role not only in the verification and approval but also in a constant access to data and measurement any time locally or remotely to guarantee success. Digital measurements will ensure the following: eliminating manual error or inconsistency, increasing productivity, minimizing waste, and enabling greater factory automation. Several measurands can be recorded with a data acquisition system including distance and displacement, temperature, voltage, current strain, and pressure. Measurement and quantification are the basic concepts of metrology. This considers explicit and internationally accepted definitions, principles and standards. Similar to the principle of digital twin manufacturing, digital twin metrology inspection is the combination of a software model of the product as 3D CAD with semantic tolerances.}

abstract = {Abstract Attacks on cyber-physical systems, such as nuclear and water treatment plants, have physical consequences that impact the lives of thousands of citizens. In such systems, it is mandatory to monitor the field network and detect potential threats before a problem occurs. This work proposes a hybrid approach that orchestrates unsupervised and incremental learning methods to detect threats that impact the control loops in a plant. We use online data processing to identify new attack vectors. We train the online incremental learning method as new attacks arrive. We also apply a one-class support vector machine to each monitored sensor or actuator to retrieve abnormal behaviors of their closed control loop. The proposed solution orchestrates the outputs from the two machine learning methods and alerts the system operators when it detects a threat. We evaluate the proposal on the Secure Water Treatment testbed dataset, and the results reveal that our proposal detects threats at more than 90\% precision and with accuracy higher than 95\%.},

abstract = {Abstract As the world races to respond to the diverse and expanding demands for electrochemical energy storage solutions, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) remain the most advanced technology in the battery ecosystem. Even as unprecedented demand for state-of-the-art batteries drives gigascale production around the world, there are increasing calls for next-generation batteries that are safer, more affordable, and energy-dense. These trends motivate the intense pursuit of battery manufacturing processes that are cost effective, scalable, and sustainable. The digital transformation of battery manufacturing plants can help meet these needs. This review provides a detailed discussion of the current and near-term developments for the digitalization of the battery cell manufacturing chain and presents future perspectives in this field. Current modelling approaches are reviewed, and a discussion is presented on how these elements can be combined with data acquisition instruments and communication protocols in a framework for building a digital twin of the battery manufacturing chain. The challenges and emerging techniques provided here is expected to give scientists and engineers from both industry and academia a guide toward more intelligent and interconnected battery manufacturing processes in the future.},
