abstract = {Over the next few decades, the energy and chemicals markets will face a very important reshaping. Chemicals represent one of the fastest-growing crude-oil-demand sectors. The two thermodynamic parameters to be considered when analysing the thermodynamics of chemical reaction are enthalpy and Gibbs energy. This chapter covers the development of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide over nickel-based catalysts using the mean-field approximation. Since the 1960s, different reaction mechanisms for the noncatalytic decomposition of methane have been postulated. The petrochemical/chemical and allied products technology has certain well-defined characteristics. The chapter focuses on the vision, business trends, digital transformation and RAM modelling. Technology is changing industries and downstream oil and gas is no different. The digital transformation offers new tools that enable downstream producers to improve the yield of valuable products, while also reducing energy consumption and increasing throughput.}

abstract = {In this chapter, the authors employ strategic foresight methods to analyze Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) within a future Dynamic Disaster Management System and consider the role Medical Examiner (MEs)/Cs offer society, particularly when everyone is experiencing a devastating disaster event. According to Ralston and Wilson, performing future trend analysis, which entails horizon scanning, provides the best means of identifying early signals of change. Following a review of megatrends, futuring involves a Forcefield Analysis to determine drivers and constrainers of change. Unlike traditional analysis, the benefit of futuring is ME/Cs can “stresstest” DVI strategies to figure out if they will work in the twenty-first century. The advantage of grouping the findings into strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat categories is that it simplifies the content and helps leaders recognize issues of greatest concern. Specific to disasters, ME/Cs will need to regularly consider new DVI strategies versus thinking past strategies will work.}

abstract = {Abstract Energy systems across the world are becoming localized, decarbonized, and digitalized. This is the era of local energy system integrating heat, power, and transport. Local energy system refers to arrangements that operate locally at a scale less than the traditional centralized model to maximize social, economic, environmental benefits for people or organization in a specific geographical area. Beyond decarbonization, local energy systems are expected to provide a wide range of other benefits such as alleviating fuel poverty, community income generation. The increase in the deployment of local energy systems has been the subject of intensive research and development in recent era. This article aims to review the recent local energy system developments in India and United Kingdom. Specifically, this will focus on local energy system taxonomy, landscape, challenges, pilot projects, policies, energy storage technologies in India and United Kingdom. Further, this work will also discuss how local energy system can be used for electrification of rural India. Thus, this work will put forward the latest developments of local energy system in a developed and developing country. This work will conclude by presenting the way forward for local energy system adoption and development in India and United Kingdom. It is expected that this work will help power and energy system researchers to track down the recent developments and landscape, and lessons of local energy system.
