abstract = {Abstract Digital servitization is a business model transformation process enabled by the use of digital technologies to create or improve industrial services and product-service offerings by creating value and competitive advantage increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty as well as company revenue streams. 5G networks can enable digital servitization of manufacturing by providing faster, more secure, and more reliable communications between machines, devices, and humans. This paper explores the impact of adopting 5G technologies on servitization and identifies the services that can benefit most from 5G networks. The research consists of two parts: a literature review of the technologies currently used in the design and provision of industrial services that could benefit from 5G networks and an exploratory survey involving manufacturing companies that have started the digital servitization journey. The main results emerging from the research suggest that 5G can profoundly impact services supported by Augmented Reality, Cloud computing, and Cyber-physical systems, mainly concerning maintenance, workforce training, machine diagnosis and monitoring.},

It is a technological challenge due to the complexity of warships. It is necessary to define architectures (storage in the cloud), type of deployment (up to what extend the ship should be sensorized), use or not of open-source platforms, scalability, etc. The physical part connected to the virtual part, with the first sending real data to the second part, allows reliable predictions of the behavior of equipment and systems on board.

abstract = {Abstract The privacy of electricity consumers has become one of the most critical subjects in designing smart meters and their proliferation. In this work, a multilayer architecture has been proposed for anonymous data collection from smart meters, which provides: (1) The anonymity of information for third-party data consumers; (2) Secure communication to utility provider network for billing purposes; (3) Online control of data sharing for end-users; (4) Low communication costs based on available Internet of things (IoT) communication protocols. The core elements of this architecture are, first, the digital twin equivalent of the cyber-physical system and, second, the Tangle distributed ledger network with IOTA cryptocurrency. In this architecture, digital twin models are updated in real-time by information received from trusted nodes of the Tangle distributed network anonymously. A small-scale laboratory prototype based on this architecture has been developed using the dSPACE SCALEXIO real-time simulator and open-source software tools to prove the feasibility of the proposed solution. The numerical results confirm that after a few seconds of anomaly detection, the microgrid was fully stabilized around its operating point with less than 5\% deviation during the transition time.},

abstract = {Abstract Digital twins, succinctly described as the digital representation of a physical object, is a concept that has emerged relatively recently with increasing application in the manufacturing industry. This article proposes the application of this concept to the healthcare domain to provide enhanced clinical decision support and enable more patient-centric, and simultaneously more precise and individualized care to ensue. Digital twins combined with advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to facilitate the integration and processing of vast amounts of heterogeneous data stemming from diversified sources. Hence, in healthcare this can provide enhanced diagnosis and treatment decision support. In applying digital twins in combination with AI to complex healthcare contexts to assist clinical decision making, it is also likely that a key current challenge in healthcare; namely, providing better quality care which is of high value and can lead to better clinical outcomes and a higher level of patient satisfaction, can ensue. In this focus article, we address this proposition by focusing on the case study of cancer care and present our conceptualization of a digital twin model combined with AI to address key, current limitations in endometrial cancer treatment. We highlight the role of AI techniques in developing digital twins for cancer care and simultaneously identify key barriers and facilitators of this process from both a healthcare and technology perspective.

abstract = {Summary The advent of solutions with AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology means tools and software that integrate resources that automate the process of making algorithmic decisions. Simply put, AI consists of systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks improving iteratively over time based on the information collected. Thus, IoT currently matches a series of hardware that works connected to the internet, from a refrigerator to a wearable watch that measures heart rate and sends this data to an application. In this sense, it is possible to interpret what part of these devices uses, even on a small scale, AI technology. This technological innovation connects everyday intelligent devices or even intelligent sensors, to the internet, linking the physical world increasingly closer to the digital world. In this scenario, the world is experiencing a digital transformation, and related to it, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) aims to connect different devices to collect and transmit data present in an industrial environment. Performing this communication through essential industrial variables related to smart devices, effecting communication, data, and data analysis.

The article first introduces the design characteristics of Blockchain as a Platform and then examines successful use-cases for its implementation using the above attributes. It may be conjectured that the 3TIC framework would serve as the basis of a cross industry process for Blockchain. The intended contribution is that such a standard process will support industry-academia collaboration in the development of Blockchain platforms and services of relevance and utility as it can be applied by firms to structure their requirements and design specifications.},

abstract = {Abstract Nuclear facilities have a regulatory requirement to measure radiation levels within Post Operational Clean Out (POCO) around nuclear facilities each year, resulting in a trend towards robotic deployments to gain an improved understanding during nuclear decommissioning phases. The UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority supports the view that human-in-the-loop (HITL) robotic deployments are a solution to improve procedures and reduce risks within radiation characterisation of nuclear sites. The authors present a novel implementation of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) deployed in an analogue nuclear environment, comprised of a multi-robot (MR) team coordinated by a HITL operator through a digital twin interface. The development of the CPS created efficient partnerships across systems including robots, digital systems and human. This was presented as a multi-staged mission within an inspection scenario for the heterogeneous Symbiotic Multi-Robot Fleet (SMuRF). Symbiotic interactions were achieved across the SMuRF where robots utilised automated collaborative governance to work together, where a single robot would face challenges in full characterisation of radiation. Key contributions include the demonstration of symbiotic autonomy and query-based learning of an autonomous mission supporting scalable autonomy and autonomy as a service. The coordination of the CPS was a success and displayed further challenges and improvements related to future MR fleets.},

With the digital revolution, the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are shrinking to merge with new interactive modes between operators, machines, and products. Artificial intelligence, 3D printing, virtual reality, digital twin, blockchain, robotics, and digital technologies are transforming the means of production, organization, and business models of companies. If it is a more competitive technological revolution, bearer of numerous innovations, and creator of a new market dynamic, of possible reintegration of manufacturing in Western countries, Industry 4.0 disrupts the world of work as a whole. Indeed, it is the whole system of decision and political regulation of companies, communities, and states (and their natures) of the work relations on the part of the operators which is questioned with an obligation to get out of the processes of individualization and social misanthropy which are taking place at the moment. Transitions are therefore taking place with the search for a possible combination of classical aspects with the immense potential of digital technologies.}

abstract = {Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) contributes to public administration by augmenting public services, including managing big data and information technology. AI is currently utilized in e-government services that contribute value to American citizens, including providing a personalized customer experience, such as linking individualized data and processing individual assistance requests. Furthermore, AI can take over redundant routine tasks such as digital information provisioning and delivering services. However, in the United States, there is no overarching policy that governs AI. Inconsistent public policy contributes to public distrust of AI, concerns about privacy intrusion, and fears of inequitable service delivery. This review article discusses the rapid emergence of government applications of AI and provides a systematic review of proposed AI governance models. It then outlines their common components for the purpose of building a coherent, yet adaptable, AI Governance Framework and proposes a research agenda for policy and administration researchers.

We discuss the implications of our findings on selected real-world cybersecurity measures currently applied in the insurance and regulation practice or under discussion for future cyber risk control. To this end, we provide a brief overview of the current cybersecurity regulation and emphasize the role of insurance companies as private regulators. Moreover, from an insurance point of view, we provide first attempts to design systemic cyber risk obligations and to measure the systemic risk contribution of individual policyholders.}

abstract = {Summary The industrial revolution cannot be separated from the social system and from the freedom granted to people, to entrepreneurs to invest in companies that involve capital, and therefore risks. Capitalism in the financial sense plays a fundamental role. This chapter discusses the first, second, third, and fourth industrial revolutions. The fourth industrial revolution originates from the increased power of computers that follow Moore's law stipulating that their power doubles every 18 months. Artificial intelligence (AI) is based on machine learning, which itself includes deep learning. Deep learning utilizes algorithms called artificial neural networks. The transition to digital technology and AI has brought in its wake a number of digital tools and methods that have changed the landscape of the company and its means of production. The digital twin makes it possible to move from curative and preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance.}

abstract = {Summary Process control requires accurate, responsive, and maintainable measurements. This chapter examines the latest digital approach to the oil and gas industry that is the enabler to connected metering. Connected metering is digital transformation that is emerging for Industrial Internet of Things in which ubiquitous connectivity is coupled to cloud-borne data analytics and storage systems in enhancing metering accuracy and reliability. Metering has seen a tremendous growth since its early introduction in the 1800s in terms of both technology and market size. Connectivity is that enabled by the digital economy and its ubiquitous connectivity. Condition based monitoring is largely operating within the oil and gas industry as a stranded asset and typically for ultrasonic meters. A positive-unexpected consequence of collecting data within a digitization strategy is that further subsets of data may be readily formed from the larger master data sets bringing about new insights.}

abstract = {Summary The uses of Internet of Things (IoT)–based devices are increasing in the world by people, and life without such smart devices becomes impossible these days. The essential of human being has been increasing day by day and, along with the improvements in IoT, has led to demand on evolving platforms like edge computing and fog cloud. Here, we can define cloud computing terms as follows: “Cloud computing service was initially proposed due to small works in industries (to reduce the number of computer system in an organization), but later, it was implemented on a large scale”. Today, major companies like IBM and Amazon are providing such efficient services of the cloud to consumers (or millions of customers world-wide). When comes to company side of cloud computing, they actually prefer resources that are in the form of utility such as Virtual Machine (VM) and other applications, and some services involve cloud storage, hybrid cloud intelligence, and applications. Mainly, these services are classified into three main groups such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). These services are explained in this chapter in detail.}

abstract = {Abstract Smart water enables utilities, regulators, and customers to make more timely and informed decisions about how they use and regard their water resources. It has been developed to assist demand management by influencing customer behavior and reducing network leakage, lowering energy consumption, and avoiding deploying assets that are not actually needed. Smart water has seen an evolution toward monitoring wastewater applications. Challenges include the need for common operating standards and more cohesive national policy frameworks. As a result, smart water adoption occurs on a utility-by-utility basis.},
