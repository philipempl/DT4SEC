abstract = {Summary Intelligent manufacturing is used to build up adaptable and versatile assembling activities locally or internationally by utilizing the incorporated ICT and AI that can consolidate progressed processing capacity by assembling hardware. Industry 4.0 development integrates the industries as self-adaptive, self-learning, and flexible as per new conditions from SM/IM. Intelligent manufacturing is quite similar to a conventional manufacturing system in many ways. The similarities are based on timely accession, dispensation, and use of actual data from machines as well as processes in manufacturing. The information gathered from the manufacturing data can be analyzed through the IoT-based system with effective information [10] sharing which helps in improving the standard of the products. The standards of the products can be improved on basis of their quality, efficiency, reliability, and recyclability as well. System and product sustainability achieved through data management, data mining is nothing but the contribution of an intelligent manufacturing system to the factories for future growth and stability. The architecture of a cloud-based manufacturing system [22, 25–27] is equipped with smart components. For the ease of users, the data is transferred to the cloud through a specifically designed architecture called SOA.}

abstract = {Summary The terms Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing (SM) are widely used today in industry, academia, and the consulting world to describe a major industrial transition underway. This transition is truly revolutionary in that it is now possible to create a digital twin of physical operations to improve operational efficiency and safety while fostering the automation of repetitive, labor-intensive, and dangerous activities. Manufacturing before the Industrial Revolution was typically a cottage enterprise with small shops producing leather goods, clothing, harnesses, and so on. The Second Industrial Revolution began in the United States, England, and Europe with the introduction of electrical power over a grid, real-time communication over telegraph, and people and freight transportation over a network of railroads. The Third Industrial Revolution began in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of the first electronic computers.}

abstract = {Abstract We present an approach to decision support in cybersecurity with respect to cyber threats and stakeholders' requirements. We approach situations in which cybersecurity experts need to take actions to mitigate the risks, such as temporarily putting an IT system out of operation, but need to consult them with other stakeholders. We propose a decision support system that uses a mission decomposition model representing the organization's functional and security requirements on its IT infrastructure. Based on the cybersecurity state assessment, that is, discovery of vulnerabilities and attacker's position, the decision support system calculates the resilience metrics for each IT infrastructure's configuration, that is, how likely are they to not be disrupted. The calculation is enabled by two novel formal models, Privilege-Exploit Attack Graph and Bayesian Privilege Attack Graph, which reduce complex attack graphs into a comprehensible bipartite graph. Moreover, they illustrate the impact of exploiting the vulnerabilities and attackers gaining the privileges. The system recommends the most resilient mission configurations that are comprehensible to both cybersecurity experts and non-technical stakeholders, who may then choose which configuration to apply. Our approach is illustrated in a case study of a real-world medical information system.},

abstract = {Summary Manufacturing automation is vital to various industrial sectors: aeronatic, automotive, biomedical, consumer goods, and others. Two main trends influence the development of manufacturing automation: the large availability of data, reflecting the environment and the manufacturing process, and the emergence of robotics-based systems, and in general, robotics as a framework for autonomous systems. Both trends impose the integration of more powerful and adaptive control and optimization approaches, enabling new functionality and new business models. This new generation of controllers unifies data-driven, predictive, and learning-based methods making use of the available data, and of the increased computation possibilities due to cloud connectivity and access to better hardware in general. Availability of data and computation capabilities aligns in the concept of digital twin, a living virtual replica of the industrial system, which enables flexible and economically viable approaches to monitoring, predictive maintenance, and individualized production, and more efficient means to control the manufacturing systems.}

abstract = {Summary The transition to an intermittent energy production from renewable energy sources (RES) increases the complexity of providing reliable energy supply in Germany. Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.},

abstract = {Summary In the era of digitizing processes all over the world, the next step of evolution would be digitizing the energy industry. The energy industry comprising of oil and gas is affluent and momentous. Dubai is the first government to digitize all the government processes and moved to paperless transaction entirely. This means the entire government services are run through an online portal. This is just the beginning. Soon all the processes and resources will be governed by machines all over the world. This means that in order to achieve facileness and keeping everything organized, digitization is implemented. Due to this course of action, it opens up the whole world to a new level of exposure on the digital world. Cyberwarfare is now a reality. When two or more countries are at differences, there are espionages involved that are dealt digitally in today's era of technology. Digitization is the only way to make life simpler and organized for the people. In order to do that ultimately, everything would be brought within the grasps of the internet, which means anybody can access anything from anywhere. Despite this, any security measure implemented based on location etc. can be rendered moot if it can be accessed via the internet. That is why artificial intelligence in the field of cybersecurity is the need of the hour. If there is a way where the machines can be taught a way to constantly learn and evolve from active threats and process the mitigation strategies automatically without sabotaging the furtherance of digitization, then therein lies the holy grail of the digital world. This chapter explains in detail about the facets of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, along with implementing and securing a digitized workspace in the energy industry comprising oil and gas.}

AI capabilities are now being integrated into a variety of sectors, including healthcare, education, and smart-city services. Without the aid of rapid, secure, and error-tolerant communication media, these technical achievements would not have been conceivable. Traditional processing, communication, and storage technologies are incapable of maintaining high levels of user experience and scalability in immersive service environments. Users can immerse themselves in the metaverse, a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world, using cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies. This world combines elements of fantasy and reality to create a synthetic environment. A setting like this is still in the works and will necessitate a significant amount of research to reach the highest level of completion. In this paper, we will talk about some of the most important issues that need to be addressed to realize the potential of metaverse services. This chapter provides basic information about AI, metaverse technologies, the role of AI in the metaverse, the importance of AI in the metaverse, the AI technical aspects, and the feature of the metaverse with AI technology, and finally concludes with research directions.}

abstract = {Summary The healthcare sector remains actively focused on innovative medicines and treatments to improve the quality and longevity of human lives. Merely, the development of such innovations is not enough but making them available to the end consumer is imperative and that's where the HSC comes into the picture. As per the report, global medicine consumption crossed 4.5 trillion doses a year, with over 50\% of people take more than at least one daily dose of medicines, HSC management is vital for human lives. The Healthcare Supply Chain (HSC) is the most critical operation as it demands integrity, agility, resilience and cost-effectiveness. The legacy supply chain is not capable to handle the challenges of counterfeiting, geopolitical issues, disruptions due to pandemics and scarcity of skilled manpower to deliver products and services to the end consumers. Worldwide Covid-19 pandemic disruption has further strengthened the quest to revamp the HSC by making it more resilient and intelligent. Technologies like deep learning (DL) human-machine interface (HMI), machine learning (ML), blockchain, robotics, cloud computing, AI, big data analytics (BDA), Digital Twins, Industry 4.0, IoT and control towers aid for developing end-to-end intelligent, integrated and data-driven supply chain.}
