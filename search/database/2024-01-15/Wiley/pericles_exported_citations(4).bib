abstract = {Summary Digitalization is the business transformation that is using digital technologies to change business models and provide new revenue streams and value opportunities. Digitalization of the energy system that has been ongoing since a decade has been focusing on the infrastructure and operations without integrating customer services and the overall value chain as stated in the SmartGrids European initiative. Digitalization across the electricity networks, the energy networks, and the overall energy value chain leading to disruptive digital services beyond boundaries and networks will be considered. An outlook vision of the digital networks, the digital state of the art enabling technologies supporting the development of new services, or the use cases and their associated benefits will be numerated. The concept of an integrated digital platform across stakeholders, reshaping the energy landscape in Europe, leading to significant benefits and providing a European competitive advantage, will be introduced. This chapter will be ended by providing key recommendations.}

abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, many complex multi-vendor production environments, such as telecom infrastructures in smart cities or on-board passenger information systems in trains, are based on micro-services and deployed in the cloud. From a service integrator viewpoint, building new solutions for these environments, which can host a large number of externally designed and developed micro-services, is often complex and error-prone. This is in part due to undocumented behaviour or undocumented architectural specifications of such systems. Advanced service monitoring can offer a solution to quickly detect anomalies or unexpected service interaction behaviour during on-site integration. However, the monitoring service should not have an impact on the production environment itself. Therefore, this article proposes an agent-based unobtrusive monitoring platform, capable of monitoring both internally developed and externally developed services through the use of sidecar containers. It monitors state, metrics and network traffic at micro-service level and the research was conducted as part of the DynAMo research project, a collaboration with various industry partners. Prototype evaluation proves that our solution has a negligible impact (below 0.02\% CPU usage on average) on an existing micro-service environment just as other monitoring systems like Prometheus while offering additional functionality focused on multi-vendor service integration. This makes it suitable to be deployed in complex production domains to further aid on-site integration and quickly find potential new anomalies.},

abstract = {Abstract A systems perspective of an emergent field such as Industry 4.0 requires combining and analysing the entire multidisciplinary scholarship under one map. Recent developments in scientometric analysis allow researchers to carry out complex bibliometric analyses coupled with an unstructured ontological discovery made available through thematic and ensuing semantic analyses to gain a holistic outlook on the ecosystem of Industry 4.0. The state-of-the-art review of the entire scholarship of Industry 4.0 demonstrates three broad clusters—the implications of automation on industry, the integration of technologies and technological advancements driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The scholarship output is, for the first time, compared with the leading industrial and policymaking institutional reports to highlight similarities and discrepancies. This allows to propose a previously unavailable definition of Industry 4.0, which is much needed to progress the research further. The three highly discrepant areas between academic literature and industry insights include lack of research into return on investment, lack of research involving policymaking, and the implications of technological development on the workforce, firms and countries. It is imperative to drive research into the existent, as well as the highlighted, themes in advancing the knowledge and aligning the academic scholarship with the interests of practitioners.},

abstract = {Summary Intangible assets are the raw material for trade and social relationships in the 21st Century and, more precisely, for the value chains of the digital age. The creation, protection, exchange, valorization, enrichment and monetization of intangible assets all come up against obstacles in the form of three categories of systemic asymmetries: trust and security asymmetries, information and control asymmetries, and revenue and recognition asymmetries. The original Bitcoin protocol, called proof of work, aims to prevent malicious people from attacking the Bitcoin network by forcing them to use their computing power to prove their contributions to the network. Private protocols, such as proof of authority, are more “human centered” and can achieve a much lower carbon footprint. The augmentation convergence of the Bio, Phy and Digital worlds is based on the AugmentChain propelled by three “pyramidal” engines, the enablers, the catalysts and the outcome that work together in short cycles.}

abstract = {Abstract Internet-based information exchange has resulted in the propagation of false and misleading information, which is highly detrimental to individuals and humankind. Due to the speed and volume of social media news production, supervised artificial intelligence algorithms require many annotated data, which is difficult, costly, and time-consuming. To address this issue, we offer a novel federated semi-supervised framework based on self-ensembling that utilizes the linguistic and stylometric information of annotated news articles and searches for hidden patterns in unlabeled data to denoise labels. Self-ensembling predicts the labels of unlabeled data by using the outcomes of network-in-training from earlier epochs. These cumulative predictions should be a stronger predictor for unknown labels than the output of the most recent training epoch; hence, they may be utilized as a substitute for the labels of unlabeled data. The approach is distinctive in collecting all of the outputs from the neural network's past training periods. It utilizes them as an unsupervised target against which to assess the current output prediction of unlabeled articles. We intend to create a dataset centred on denoising to forward the study. The dataset is mapped using (1) the shifting focus time from published news articles and (2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for a neural contrast embedding model for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors that generate a focus time-based query in sequential news articles for temporal comprehension. The model achieved 0.83\% F-measure with lexicon expansion semi-supervised learning.},

abstract = {Summary Industry 4.0 reshaped the production and manufacturing landscape by enhancing operational efficiency and introducing novel business models, services, and goods. With Industry 4.0, we set out to improve the manufacturing processes in two key areas: productivity and longevity. With the focus on digitizing and digitalizing systems, more progress is feasible. As technology advances, it becomes more concerned with automating and optimizing processes than improving the human condition. The augmentation of technology channels is substantially enhanced by the increasing efficiency with which cutting-edge informatics insights and linked devices may be extracted. Civilization 5.0, on the other hand, involves a human-centered organization capable of juggling social responsibilities and economic expressions through a foundational blend of cyber physical environment. Similar to the implementation of technology change throughout all areas of engineering by Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Society 5.0 (S5.0) encourages people to embrace a digital makeover of their daily lives. Indeed the movement and part of the technological initial plan and the rapid development of ICT suggesting that they are mutually supportive is the favorable interpretation of Society 5.0. This research delves into the challenges and opportunities that have arisen as a consequence of I4.0 and S5.0 and discusses how these phenomena will progress in the near and far future.}

abstract = {Summary The various industrial revolutions have always been preceded by scientific, technological and organizational advances and innovations. In this chapter, the authors present a brief overview of these earlier revolutions before introducing Industry 4.0. The technological advances in the fourth Industrial Revolution resulted in a new generation of factories, which have been given various labels: the factories of the future, smart factories, digital factories, cyberfactories, integrated factories, innovative factories, Factory 4.0, and even Industry 4.0. To clarify the semantics of the terminology relating to technologies in Industry 4.0, Julien and Martin have suggested categorizing digital technologies into three categories: disruptive technologies; technologies for communication and interconnection; and data management technologies. Defining Industry 4.0, the panorama of technologies that make up Industry 4.0, their importance and temporal relevance form the framework for industrial safety, which must adapt to new demands.}
