abstract = {Summary The digital transformation of 'the working society introduces a further phase in the management of economic activities.”Digital Manufacturing' continues the concept of 'Computer Integrated Manufacturing' announced in the 1970s on the basis of, available, Internet-based technologies. The digital transformation should strengthen the competitiveness of commercial enterprises, while enabling desirable ways of working at the same time. The digital transformation is an opportunity to shed some light on the role of the human individual in digital manufacturing and the business development potential of a human-centered work design. Measures taken to adapt work to people refer to technical-ergonomic conditions and/or to substantive-organizational conditions of the work activity. Immersion, that is, complete immersion in the virtual world by means of head-mounted displays or projections, addresses as many human senses as possible, in order to achieve a realistic simulation. The digital transformation is changing human work and workload patterns.}

abstract = {Abstract Research on Reconfigurable Battery Systems (RBS) is gaining emphasis over the traditional fixed topology of the battery pack due to its advantages of adapting flexible topology (series-parallel) during its operation in the pack for meeting the non-linear time-dependent load requirements. There could emerge serious issues such as those related to safety due to malfunction of the switching circuit, heat generation from switches during frequent switching of circuits, charging temperature rise, increased charging time, sensing issues arising from the use of low-accuracy voltage/current sensors, state of charge/state of health estimation, and cost issues due to the use of increasing number of switches, fuses, contactors, relays, circuit breakers etc. To address these mentioned issues, the problem of optimal switching circuit topology for RBS is formulated as a mathematical multi-objective optimisation problem. An intelligent system framework based on digital twins is proposed. The proposed framework is further extended to a life cycle management approach that includes the interactions among pack design, pack assembly and operational and recycling levels. This could provide greater access of real-time big data cloud storage to the battery designers, manufacturers and recycling industries, who can make use of it to optimise their designs, systems and operations.},

abstract = {Abstract This review aims to assess the most prevalent disruptive technologies of the past decade and evaluate them from a dual perspective. This study utilises the technology life cycle framework to classify disruptive technologies into three phases, (i) emerging, (ii) industry, and (iii) customer-focused research outcomes. Subsequently, entities using six thematic categories via topic modelling are assessed to determine the research trajectory about customers, industries, and theory. The present study utilises the Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework for topic modelling, a quantitative tool that employs advanced statistical methodology to extract semantic knowledge from large text corpora. This approach offers a more comprehensive and insightful categorisation of information compared to traditional research review models such as archive review, meta-review analysis, and systematic literature review. After the review, over 750 articles were analysed and classified according to their unique themes and technological emphasis. The study suggests practical applications that could enhance industrial progress through disruptive technology. Furthermore, by identifying gaps, the authors suggest multiple research prospects for forthcoming investigations on disruptive technologies and their impact on consumer behaviour. This research is novel in various aspects. This research is by far the only research record in the last decade that provides a systematic literature review of disruptive technologies with an extensive focus on customers. Considering the methodological perspective, this research uses topic modelling as a new literature review model, enabling analysing more research outputs and yielding more valuable findings than traditional methodologies.}

We build on network-based models of platform growth to characterize configurations of digital and physical supply chain infrastructure. We define cross-platform effect as the value accrued by a platform on one side of a multiplatform configuration as capability for the opposite side platform evolves. We posit that aligning cross-platform effect across digital and physical infrastructure enhances system outcomes. Our arguments are informed by evidence on private–public partnerships for developing production and distribution infrastructure in the pharmaceutical industry. We identify enablers and inhibitors for cross-platform effects within these data in terms of product and process technology readiness, path-dependent standards creation, organizational alignment, regulatory fragmentation, and the desire towards such infrastructure yielding resilient outcomes. Implications of findings, in shaping analytical and empirical research on managing supply chain infrastructure, at the levels of firms, industries, and public policies are discussed.},

abstract = {Summary This chapter studies the cloud security issues in network forensics and a large-scale machine-to-machine (M2M) communication impact on the fourth industrial revolution. The parameters help to gather, analyze, and document information about incidentals security and network-based crime activities. It also supports the solving of a complication related to the network traffic in the cloud, virtual machine dynamic migration, virtual resources of cloud clients, provides an environment like multi-tenancy, does not infringe on the security and protection of other cloud users, and most important, avoids transferring costs of large sets of data and processed directly. Cloud security and M2M communication permit the discovery of the best conceivable security configuration, improve communication, self-monitoring, and diagnose cloud security issues without the need for human intervention. Restrictions and crucial points are emphasized to arrange for initial forensics investigations and also further studies in this area. This chapter presents a model that is generic in nature for network forensics in the cloud environment as well as defines prototype artifact that articulates the M2M communication security issue that impacts on fourth industrial revolution application. We validate the architecture prototype with an implementation based on the OpenNebula Hypervisor web-based interface and the NetworkMiner analysis framework.}

abstract = {Abstract Now is the time to refocus efforts in urban research and design. A changing climate and extreme weather events are presenting unique challenges to urban systems around the world. These challenges illuminate the social barriers that accompany disruptive events such as resource inequities and injustices. In this perspective, we provide three research priorities for just and sustainable urban systems that help to address these matters. The three research priorities are: (1) social equity and justice, (2) circularity, and (3) digital twins. Conceptual context and future research directions are provided for each. For social equity and justice, the future directions are mandatory equity analysis and inclusionary practices, understanding and reconciling historical injustices, and intentional integration with diverse community stakeholders. For circularity applications, they are better metrics for integration, more robust evaluation frameworks, and dynamic modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Future directions for digital twins include developing principles to reduce complexity, integrating model and system components, and reducing barriers to data access. These research priorities are core to meeting several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., 1—No Poverty, 8—Decent Work and Economic Growth, 10—Reduced Inequalities, and 11—Sustainable Cities and Communities). Useful social and technical matters are discussed throughout, where we highlight the importance of prioritizing localized research efforts, provide guidance for community-engaged research and co-development practices, and explain how these priorities interact to align with the evolving field of industrial ecology.},

abstract = {Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated for more than 60 years. With the development of computing power, innovative algorithms, and gathering of massive data, AI will be rejuvenated in the next decade and become one of the most important enabling technologies for 5G automation. How to use the powerful analysis, judgment, and prediction capabilities provided by the AI algorithms to enable 5G equipment, networks and service systems, and combine them with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of carriers' networks become an important topic in the ICT industry. Based on deep understanding, accumulated experience in telecom field, and long-term investment in AI strategies, many organizations have been introducing AI technology to telecom networks and contributing to development of standards essential for improving the quality and security of AI products and services, ensuring user safety and creating a fair and open industry ecosystem. 5G networks can be automatically deployed (automatic service deployment and automatic running) with the introduction of AI based on application scenarios. AI algorithms can also be used for self-healing (automatic fault recovery), self-optimization (network self-optimization) and creating autonomous 5G systems (self-evolving networks), which continuously improve network efficiency and reduce OPEX. This article aims at presenting the most relevant use cases, prominent research outcomes, latest standard developments and related standardization gaps, examples of AI strategy interpretation, AI solutions – including communication intelligent platform, AI model service, and deployment solution – and typical application scenarios. As a part of this framework, this article introduces the most important aspects of AI security, in terms of protecting the integrity and confidentiality of AI models and data, and thus preventing attackers from changing the inference results or stealing data.}

This study provides the results of a brief investigation of the main factors that contribute the success of DT and demonstrates the value of using technology roadmapping alongside systems engineering (SE) practices to create a path between identified “AS-IS” and “TO-BE” operational states. Applying SE methods to the adoption of the “T-Plan” roadmapping process resulted in a strategic communication tool that can be used among stakeholders to support them with the integration of business planning and technology adoption, and to help assess the impact that new technologies may have on their organizations in their journey toward a successful DT. In addition to the roadmap itself, which benefits the case company, this study contributes to building and enriching academic literature by providing insight from the oil and gas industry and demonstrating the use of technology roadmapping to create a strategic plan for DT in a well-established industrial domain.},

abstract = {Summary Understanding cybersecurity hazards and risk is one of the pillars in the RBPS approach for cybersecurity. Industrial (OT) cybersecurity risk is concerned with intentional or unintentional interference with the potential to compromise industrial automation and control systems by means of computer connected systems. The process industry has many targets that may be attractive to cybercriminals. Depending on their motivation, attackers will target different components on the process control system. Unlike cybersecurity incidents on IT systems, which tend to result almost exclusively in economic consequences, OT cybersecurity incidents can create a number of potential consequences, depending on the objectives of the attacker. The chapter provides a summary of information that should be considered when updating a process safety consequence severity table to apply to cybersecurity risk assessment.}

abstract = {Summary Cyber–Physical–Human Systems (CPHS) provide a new perspective and framework to support effective and efficient operations of complex systems, especially those that involve human and social factors in their management and control. However, the complexity of human and social behaviors in CPHS intensifies the differences between the models of systems and the systems to be modeled, thus leads the so-called “Cognitive Gap” or “Modeling Gap” for complex systems. Consequently, Merton's Laws rather than Newton's Laws must be applied in describing, predicting, and prescribing entities for CPHS. The ACP approach, which consists of “Artificial Systems” for description, “Computational Experiments” for prediction, and “Parallel Execution” for prescription or control and management, has transformed system models from system analysis into software-defined processes for data generation to make complex systems computable, testable, and verifiable. Based on ACP, Parallel Intelligence (PI) is constructed from the interactions and entanglement between actual systems and artificial systems. This chapter summarizes the research on PI and CPHS over the past 20 years. After a brief description of the history and framework, various applications are presented along eight aspects: parallel control and intelligent control, parallel robotics and parallel manufacturing, parallel management and intelligent organizations, parallel medicine and smart healthcare, parallel ecology and parallel societies, parallel economic systems and social computing, parallel military systems, and parallel cognition and parallel philosophy. Finally, the technical support and future direction for CPHS development are addressed.}
