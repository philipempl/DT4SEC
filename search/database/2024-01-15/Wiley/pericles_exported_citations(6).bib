abstract = {Summary Today, Machine Learning (ML) is apart of our daily life. It has major advancements in its applications and research as well. ML is the study in which a machine is trained with past data and examples and uses algorithms to build the logic. Important ML applicationsare speech recognition, computer vision, bio-surveillance, robot or automation control, empirical science experiments, DNA classification, intrusion detection, astronomical data analysis, information security, transportation, etc. According to a recent survey, computer-generated insurance advice is helpful to customers. Using ML, determination of cover for a certain customer can be predicted. Choice of the mode of transportation can also be benefited from ML. ML predicts the mode of transportation for an individual to make their travel better. Travel modes may include private car, public transport (bus or train), or soft mode (walking or cycling). The very first step in applying ML is to define a problem. This step includes three important processes to be considered, namely, problem identification, the motivation behind problem solving, and the solution itself. This chapter presents the evolution of ML along with the purpose it serves. It also focuses on the ideas of concept learning along with the methods and algorithms therein.}

The potential of AI in automating all kinds of processes is simply unlimited. The oil and gas sector deals with recurrent processes all the time. There is a lifecycle involved in the oil and gas production, which comprises five phases. Each time an oil and gas extraction project is started, the five phases are to be repeated. This makes it a good surface for implementation of AI. In the current scenario, there are several individual scenarios where AI is being used as part of the oil and gas industry. The thing is it is not incorporated as a single stream, rather the companies that deal with the industry have automated whatever they could, like the chatbot assistance. But, the capability of AI is much more than a simple chatbot. It can prove useful in so many ways in the oil and gas industry. This would make the industry and returns of the industry incrementally profitable and effective. This chapter deals with the applications of AI in various sectors in the oil and gas industry.}

It explains the effects and influences of insulation coordination and the reasons for studies are given. The chapter examines the health and safety impact of GIS and also explains very fast transient voltages and transient enclosure voltages for GIS. It describes the decomposition by-products of SF 6 and handling procedure. Most of the GIS equipment is shipped from the factory assembled and filled with positive SF 6 gas pressure or dry nitrogen. The GIS manufacturers follow the environmentally conscious design process, described in IEC 62430. Insulation coordination is the basic criteria for the reliability of the GIS. The grounding of the GIS is the most important protection against overvoltage stress. The very fast transient overvoltage generated internally within the GIS could become incident on externally connected apparatus.}

abstract = {Abstract Business process management (BPM) provides many benefits for a company including productivity, efficiency, compliance, risk management, consistency, repeatability, and measurability. Many of these aspects also ensure and improve functional safety, privacy, and security in process execution. However, managed business processes lack flexibility; ie, changing a business process requires more effort than ad hoc execution and adaptation. Thus, especially in small companies, the acceptance rate of managed business processes is low. So we claim that in current BPM approaches, the structuredness ensuring functional safety and security concepts contradicts with the objective for flexibility. The main goal of the AdaBPM project is to address this contradiction by providing a formal approach to handle advanced adaptations and exception handling in business processes. The technical objectives of the project include (1) the definition of a basic framework being capable of handling different levels of adaptivity and considering security and safety requirements at the same time, (2) a rigorous process specification language and model refinement methods, (3) static business process adaptations, and (4) dynamic (or ad hoc) adaptations. The result of our research is a general approach for flexible BPM combined with the possibility to nevertheless manage the process and define safety and security restrictions.},

abstract = {Abstract Principles of Industry 4.0 direct us to predict how pharmaceutical operations and regulations may exist with automation, digitization, artificial intelligence (AI), and real time data acquisition. Machine learning (ML), a sub-discipline of AI, involves the use of statistical tools to extract the desired information either through understanding the underlying patterns in the information or by development of mathematical relationships among the critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of biopharmaceuticals. ML is still in its infancy for directly supporting the quality-by-design based development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals. However, adoption of ML-based models in place of conventional multi-variate-data-analysis (MVDA) is increasing with the accumulation of large-scale data. This has been majorly contributed by the real-time monitoring of process variables and quality attributes of products through the implementation of process analytical technology in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. All aspects of healthcare, from drug design to product distribution, are complex and multidimensional. Thus, ML-based approaches are being applied to achieve sophistication, accuracy, flexibility and agility in all these areas. This review discusses the potential of ML for addressing the complex issues in diverse areas of biopharmaceutical development, such as biopharmaceuticals design and assessment of early stage development, upstream and downstream process development, analysis, characterization and prediction of post-translational modifications (PTMs), formulation, and stability studies. Moreover, the challenges in acquisition, cleaning and structuring the bioprocess data, which is one of the major hurdles in implementation of ML in biopharma industry, have also been discussed. Regulatory perspectives on implementation of AI/ML in the biopharma sector have also been briefly discussed. This article is a bird's eye view on the recent developments and applications of ML in overcoming the challenges for adopting “Industry – 4.0” in the biopharma industry.},

abstract = {Summary Power systems are undergoing a massive transformation in recent times, to accommodate a variety of new actors entering this space. The generation sector is getting an unprecedented renewable penetration at different voltage levels that change the status quo of upstream and downstream power flow. The consumption sector is also getting many emerging entrants at medium voltage level, namely charging infrastructure and data centers, that require a lot of power quality adjustments to maintain the stability and grid code compliance, both at source and load end. The transmission and distribution sector thus need to align with the generation and consumption profiles, so that the power flow becomes smooth, seamless, and free from interruptions. All these constraints must be addressed under the ambit of a decarbonized world (grid) while taking a lot of other political and climatic volatilities into consideration. This chapter notes down some of these problems and addresses them with relevant technology innovations, defining the role of smart power systems and making various interplays possible. The effervescence of digitalization in the grid network has been elaborated, with possible integration of AI, data science, communication technology, etc.; which already proved effective in other domains. The concept of a holistic condition monitoring for more systemic interactions and correlation between different assets in a substation is discussed for smart overloading, grid decongestion, capacity readjustments, etc. Some outlooks for power system are outlined that would be crucial for the prosperity of both users and operators of the grid, by economically benefiting from it.}

abstract = {In the Industry 4.0 era, automation and data analytics emerge as the major forces to enhance efficiency in operations management (OM). Disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, 3D printing, 5G, Internet-of-Thing, digital twins, and augmented reality, are widely applied. They potentially will bring a radical change to real world operations. In this study, we first explore several major disruptive technologies, examine the corresponding OM studies, and highlight their current applications in the industry. Then, we discuss the pros and cons associated with the use of these technologies and uncover the potential human–machine conflicting areas. After that, we propose measures which may be able to achieve human–machine reconciles in the coming Industry 5.0 era. A concept of “sustainable social welfare” which includes worker welfare, privacy, etc. is proposed and the roles played by policy makers are also discussed. Finally, a future research agenda, which covers topics in both the Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 eras, is established.},

abstract = {Summary This chapter presents EU–US industrial drivers and societal needs that are relevant for EU–US collaboration activities in the information and communication technology sector. The contents are based on the industry interviews that were performed, complemented by the results of the desk research. The chapter presents the key recommendations from industry, complemented by potential collaboration topics that were identified from the desk-based landscape analysis. Some of the recommendations are very specific and linked with industry priorities. The chapter provides a summary of barriers, both general barriers and barriers that were identified for the societal domains Smart Cities, Smart Energy, and Smart Transportation. Additionally, the interviews with industry highlighted some cultural business barriers between the European Union and the United States that are summarized as well.}
