The BDVA Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) defines overall goals, technical and non-technical priorities, and research and innovation challenges for this European Public Private Partnership (PPP) on big data. With the aim to find an agreed synthesis, the BDVA adopted the smart manufacturing industry (SMI) concept definition, including the whole value chain gravitating around goods production. Both the Industrial Internet Consortium and Platform Industries 4.0 have developed IT reference architectures in the manufacturing domain: Platform Industries 4.0's Reference Architecture Model for Industries 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) and the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA). The chapter shows the list of research challenges within the three SMI scenarios: smart factory scenario, smart supply chain scenario, and smart product lifecycle.}

Besides international SDOs, there are a number of regional, national, and industrial blockchain standards are published or under development. They are connected with ISO, ITU-T, and/or IEEE through membership or liaison relationships. Blockchain is a technology stack where innovative mechanisms and digital solutions can be built upon.}

abstract = {Abstract Digital manufacturing technologies (DMTs) have the potential to transform industry productivity, but their introduction into the workplace is often a complex process, requiring not only technical expertise but also an awareness of ethical and societal challenges surrounding human–system integration. Concerns about the introduction of new technology have been prevalent throughout history, and exploring public perceptions of these technologies can provide insight to help address such cultural anxieties. However, evaluating user perceptions of futuristic technology is difficult, requiring novel approaches to provide context and understanding. To explore users' perceptions of future DMTs, we applied the ContraVision technique in a questionnaire-based study. Participants viewed films, representing fictionalized utopic and dystopic visions of what the future of these DMTs might involve, and a questionnaire probed the perceptions of the technologies afterward. Findings showed that irrespective of the way technology was portrayed, participants had concerns about the ethical and responsible implementation of these tools. Participant responses were analyzed to identify key challenges for policy surrounding DMT implementation in the future of manufacturing.},

abstract = {Abstract This study examined the emergence of value creation during digital transformation. We used case studies to gather empirical evidence of the phenomenon from an organizational perspective. The study tried to closely link theory and practice by identifying the mechanisms that determined the paths of value creation in 11 companies that had taken concrete steps toward digital transformation. It contributed to knowledge management research by building a research framework according to previous literature and outlining three different value creation paths based on the objectives and motivations of the organizations. The conclusions of the study were that (1) the strategic orientation of transformation must exceed a certain level to constitute an actual value creation mechanism; (2) digital transformation paths are driven by changes in the competitive environment; (3) pressure from customers impacts the value creation mechanism in digital transformation, but depends on the value creation path essence; as well as (4) value creation in digital transformation is determined by the extent to which a company manages to balance the existing business with digital transformation. The results also had managerial implications because they assisted managers in considering the key mechanisms of digital transformation.},

abstract = {Abstract The implementation of Industry 4.0 needs the convergence in operational technology and information technology (OT–IT) for improving the flexibility to access real-time data and KPIs. In India, a small-scale automation industry is full of edge devices and produces massive amount of data due to which an infrastructure may overwhelm. These industries face challenges in convergence of IT–OT like scalability. This work developed a data-driven framework, which is an additional infrastructure between the IT–OT platforms. The framework consists of data cleaning which helps to remove the anomaly from the sensor data. The uncertainty analysis ensures the correctness of the data. Variable ranking and correlation matrix help to identify the KPIs of the process. All these stages are helpful to select the data and push this selected data to cloud for developing predictive or diagnostic models. This framework is deployed for the performance prediction of four-effect falling-film evaporator used to produce skimmed milk. The outlet skimmed milk density is the key performance indicator for the present case study and it is monitored here. Both linear and neural network-based nonlinear models are used in the framework. It is noticed that linear regression model is capable of predicting the plant product density of skimmed milk with good accuracy. However, it is not capable to identify the faults in the key parameters like inlet milk flow rate. These faults can be better identified using k-means clustering at the initial stage of the framework. Practical applications This article titled “A data-analytic framework to monitor product density of four-effect falling-film evaporator for skimmed milk production” by Nivedita Wagh and Sudhir D. Agashe contains the results obtained for data-driven framework for performance prediction and fault diagnosis for four-effect falling-film evaporator used for production of skimmed milk. A data-driven framework which includes uncertainty analysis, variable ranking, various linear and neural network-based nonlinear regression models for performance prediction, and fault detection of an evaporator is proposed. The results are presented in terms of density of the skimmed milk as a performance parameter. The objective of the work is to provide the possibility of IT–OT convergence so as to solve the scalability issue in the IT–OT convergence. The authors are able to bring out a data-driven framework for fault identification using k-means clustering using four-effect falling-film evaporator used for production of skimmed milk as a case study. We hope the results will be useful to data managers for understanding the KPIs statistics and take appropriate decision in time for the overall growth of organization.},
