abstract = {Summary Extended reality (XR) technologies are rapidly morphing together with Industry 4.0 cyberphysical twins, and multi-user games and game-engine developers' software, into a concept called the metaverse, enabled by the advancements of a breadth of graphics technology, including game engines, augmented reality (AR) wearables, real-world scans, and virtual reality (VR). The future XR metaverse runs on top of the internet backbone, similar to the world wide web, and connects and decentralizes AR and VR spaces and experiences. Whether this will be an open immersive network for entertainment, education, enterprise collaboration, group-gaming, and social gatherings, or a one-world walled garden, the XR metaverse will have to be built collaboratively by many developers and organizations, because it is to huge to be built by one organization alone. It has to be built in coordination, in order to make things interoperable, and the only way to achieve this is through collaboration and openness to create a shared innovation ecosystem. Open standards and open source are essential elements of the future of XR, enabling the future XR metaverse, which is so huge, and the implications of widespread adoption are so influential that we must create it together in cross-disciplinary, international collaboration and stay vigilant to mitigate the inherent risks to privacy and security.}

abstract = {Zusammenfassung BIM-basierte Ansätze sind die Wegbereiter für effiziente Prozesse im Bauingenieurwesen und das Erreichen von Nachhaltigkeitszielen beim Bau und Betrieb von Gebäuden. Der Begriff des digitalen Zwillings hat sich in den letzten Jahren rasch weiterentwickelt von einer digitalen Replik des Gebäudes hin zu IT-Systemen, die große Datenmengen verarbeiten, datengestützte Optimierungen ermöglichen oder Steuerungsfunktionen übernehmen. Der Beitrag gibt eine Übersicht über Methoden, die für die Einführung eines digitalen Zwillings im Unternehmen essenziell sind. Getrennt wird dabei zwischen dem Themenbereich des Software Engineerings, in dem IT-Projekte im Kontext von Anforderungen, Zeit und Budget umgesetzt werden, und dem Themenbereich der Digitalen Transformation, in der strategische Entscheidungen zur Neugestaltung von Prozessen und dabei eingesetzten IT-Werkzeugen fallen. Dies ist der Ausgangspunkt für Digitale Ökosysteme in der Bauwirtschaft mit neuen Märkten und Geschäftsmodellen.}

abstract = {Abstract Digital technology is regarded as providing a promising means of moving production and consumption towards the circular economy. However, it is still unclear which functions of digital technologies are most useful to improving circularity, and how these functions could be used to enhance different circular economy strategies. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic literature review. After examining 174 papers, creating 782 original codes and 259 second-round codes, the study identifies 13 critical functions of digital technologies which are most relevant to circular economy strategies. The paper then proposes a framework which reveals seven mechanisms of how these digital functions can enhance different circular economy strategies. The framework also reveals which combinations of the digital functions and circular economy strategies have already been studied extensively as well as where there may be gaps. This indicates which digital functions are more mature in terms of possible implementation for circular economy as well as what missing links there are in the empirical and theoretical research. The study advances the synergies between digital technologies and the circular economy paradigm through the lens of digital functions. The proposed framework and mechanisms build a theoretical foundation for future research, and we highlight five research areas for further studies. This study also provides a structured way for managers to explore the appropriate digital functions for their CE strategies, so as to identify required digital technologies and new value creation through digital functions.},

The main purpose of edge computing is to describe an area as the technical landscape “over the Internet”. Edge computing extends the ability of devices to work in disconnected situations or deliver services without being fully dependent on online resources. It a key driver for the Internet of Augmented Me (I.AM). The chapter illustrates some characteristics of business cases in order to explain how to look at these business cases from an edge computing point of view. Edge computing contributes to end-to-end solutions, and transforms the I.AM into a responsive, personalized and omnipresent service. Edge computing is an essential component in the user experience, fully seamless through all the “smart everything technologies” and the collaborative models.}

abstract = {Abstract Developing renewable energy generation (REG)-rich power systems could contribute to achieving carbon neutrality. To ensure the secure and economic operation of power systems with high penetration of renewable energy, it is necessary to solve the problem of inefficient utilisation of demand-side resources by the current electricity market mechanism. The metaverse, an emerging technology attracting widespread attention, is expected to efficiently solve this problem. The metaverse can be regarded as a virtual-real interactive economic system built on advanced technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, extended reality, avatars, and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO). This paper first briefly introduces the concept, architecture, technologies, and features of the metaverse. Then, a metaverse-based DAO for energy systems is proposed and the corresponding business model is explored. The Energy DAO utilises algorithms and user consensus combined with smart contracts to solidify organisational operation rules. In this way, it organises users to directly participate in multiple types of electricity markets and carbon markets, as well as behavioural data production and transactions. Finally, an Energy DAO example for demand-side sources demonstrates how the Energy DAO could solve the problems of information asymmetry, information opacity, and incentive incompatibility in electricity market mechanisms.},

abstract = {Abstract This study contributes to state-of-the-art circular business strategies (CBSs) for Industry 4.0 (I4.0) by designating the critical indicators since the advent of I4.0 and demonstrating the business challenges and opportunities for the global development of circularity-based operations. Social media big data-driven analysis is used to compare geographical regions, and suggestions are made to promote CBSs among regions. CBSs for I4.0 are receiving increasing attention, but a holistic viewpoint and an understanding of the indicators influencing their effective and successful implementation in each region are still lacking. To fill this gap, this study aims to determine the definitive CBS indicators for I4.0 and their opportunities and challenges across regions. As an enormous amount of multisource information is obtained from capitalizing on social media data analytics, firms can adopt social media data-driven analysis, including content analysis, normal distribution tests, and the entropy weight method, to detect opportunities and challenges connected with the transformation to a CBS for I4.0. There are 28 validated indicators from the original set of relevant hashtags. The results show that the top indicators with a high level of difference among world regions selected for further discussion include waste management, vanguard leadership, deep learning, strategy execution, and collaboration. The findings of this study are a reference for decision-makers to determine a suitable direction for CBS implementation, thus gaining sustainable competitive advantages.},

Smart Manufacturing will bring automation on a number of technological fronts and to all types of manufacturing. Life on the factory floor has changed dramatically since the early days of the Industrial Revolution, when unhealthy and dangerous working conditions were the norm. Equipment was prone to breakdowns and fires with few safety protocols. Smart Manufacturing will only be successful with skilled and dedicated workers on the factory and distribution floor. Fictional artificial intelligence dominates the way the general public perceives the possibilities and potential pitfalls of machine learning applications. It is important to understand the three major roles mentioned earlier that will be needed in Smart Manufacturing: service, application, and operator. The chapter also presents three types of tools needed in smart manufacturing: process tools, process control tools, and handling tools.}

The processes are now automated to save money, manual labors, and also achieve precision output. The oil and gas field deals with recurrent processes all the time. There is a lifecycle involved in oil and gas, which comprises five phases. Each time an oil and gas extraction project is started, the five phases are to be repeated again and again. This makes it a good surface for implementation of AI. In the current scenario, there are several individual scenarios where AI is being used as a part of the oil and gas industry. The thing is it is not incorporated as a single stream, rather the companies that deal with the industry have automated whatever they could like the chatbot assistance. But the capability of AI is much more than a simple chatbot. It can prove useful in so many ways in the oil and gas industry. This would make the industry and returns of the industry incrementally profitable and effective. This chapter deals with the applications of AI in various sectors in the oil and gas industry.}
