abstract = {Summary This chapter discusses an initiative undertaken at the University of Pisa to provide its students with valuable skills to address Industry 4.0. Thanks to such an initiative, 30 undergraduate students brought their knowledge into local companies to support them in understanding Industry 4.0 basic concepts and analyzing their maturity level. In particular, the research shows the training program on the assessment model and its practical application conducted by students in one company from the region of Tuscany. The knowledge transfer process to support companies in understanding their Industry 4.0 maturity level can be one way through which higher education institutions can support the business environment. Companies can support students in translating such knowledge in best practices and concrete solutions that can be valuable for growing the professional profile of the students themselves, and for developing the company's processes and business models.}

abstract = {Summary The recent wave of creating an interconnected world through satellites has renewed interest in satellite communications. Private and government-funded space agencies are making advancements in the creation of satellite constellations, and the introduction of 5G has brought a new focus to a fully connected world. Satellites are the proposed solutions for establishing high throughput and low latency links to remote, hard-to-reach areas. This has caused the injection of many satellites in Earth's orbit, which has caused many discrepancies. There is a need to establish highly adaptive and flexible satellite systems to overcome this. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have gained much popularity when it comes to communication systems. This review extensively provides insight into ML and DL's utilization in satellite communications. This review covers how satellite communication subsystems and other satellite system applications can be implemented through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the ongoing open challenges and future directions.},

It draws on an empirical investigation into location awareness and the politics of spatial data, which explored both end-user and industry/government perceptions of location-based services and the digital platforms providing them. In keeping with the focus on contentions of the software-sorted city, the chapter discusses three broad themes: big data versus thick data, data privacy, and data sovereignty. Big data and advancement of analytical tools to make sense of these data create the illusion of knowing everything about everyone, specifically in regards to urban development and smart cities. Pioneering good data practices is significant as many jurisdictions across the world embrace both national smart city strategies and a data-driven economy.}

In light of this, the objective of this research was to verify the state of the art in information technology, more specifically the use of Big Data and its role in reducing food waste. This is descriptive research with a qualitative approach, whose technical procedure was the systematic literature review (SLR), with a time cut off the last 10 years, 2010 to 2020, which analyzed the scientific databases Scopus, Sage, and Taylor \& Francis. The results were analyzed using the precepts of the thematic categorical content analysis and indicated low use of Big Data. Still, few published articles address the recycling and valorization of food waste to minimize its waste. Finally, it is presented the existing gaps in the literature and recommendations for future studies.},

Together with extended reality (XR) technologies, these are the crucial components of the industrial metaverse due to their ability to create immersive and interactive experiences that enhance various industrial processes and operations. The industrial metaverse potential is driven by achievable, business-relevant results, and there are already solid indicators of the realized benefits in numerous areas across industrial design, production, and logistics. It is however important to note that many industrial metaverse use cases have very differing needs for optimal connectivity that will stretch the capabilities of new 5G networks. The drive to Industry 4.0 will result in dramatically more demanding requirements for latency, jitter, reliability, efficiency, and sensing, which create the concrete basis for 6G research in the industrial context.}

abstract = {Abstract There is an ever-increasing demand for next-generation devices that do not require passwords and are impervious to cloning. For traditional hardware security solutions in edge computing devices, inherent limitations are addressed by physical unclonable functions (PUF). However, realizing efficient roots of trust for resource constrained hardware remains extremely challenging, despite excellent demonstrations with conventional silicon circuits and archetypal oxide memristor-based crossbars. An attractive, down-scalable approach to design efficient cryptographic hardware is to harness memristive materials with a large-degree-of-randomness in materials state variations, but this strategy is still not well understood. Here, the utilization of high-degree-of-randomness amorphous (A) state variations associated with different operating conditions via thermal fluctuation effects is demonstrated, as well as an integrated framework for in memory computing and next generation security primitives, viz., APUF, for achieving secure key generation and device authentication. Near ideal uniformity and uniqueness without additional initial writing overheads in weak memristive A-PUF is achieved. In-memory computing empowers a strong exclusive OR (XOR-) and-repeat A PUF construction to avoid machine learning attacks, while rapid crystallization processes enable large-sized-key reconfigurability. These findings pave the way for achieving a broadly applicable security primitive for enhancing antipiracy of integrated systems and product authentication in supply chains.},

There are two main infrastructure models that have similarities and elements in common, the Open Infrastructure Foundation (OIF) and the Cloud Native. OIF architecture is based on OpenStack which is an opensource Cloud management system. OpenStack can be managed as a public or private Cloud, operated by a single organization with its own goals and making its own decisions. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is a project of the Linux Foundation that was founded in 2015 to help advance container technology and push this technology into the enterprise. The chapter introduces the European Gaia-X project, which is an attempt to react against GAFAM companies to try to free up data and allow them to simply migrate from one provider's data center to another provider's data center.}

abstract = {Abstract The current technology epoch—sometimes called the fourth industrial revolution (4IR)—involves the innovative application of rapidly advancing digital technologies such as artificial intelligence. Societal implications of the 4IR are significant and wide-ranging, from life-saving drug development to privacy loss and app addiction. A review of the information systems literature, however, reveals a narrow focus on technology-enabled business benefits. Scant research attention has been paid to the role of humans and humanistic outcomes. To spur new research addressing these issues, formalised affordance theory is employed to develop a new 4IR conceptualization. Four groupings of affordances that capture salient 4IR action possibilities are developed within two categories: machine emulation of human cognition (expansive decision-making and creativity automation) and machine emulation of human communication (relationship with humans and intermachine teaming). Implications are explored in the context of human-machine coworking and the development of artificial intelligence safety regulations. Overall, the affordance conceptualization of the 4IR advances a new sociotechnical lexicon of action possibilities and their joint enactment in achieving humanistic and instrumental outcomes, enabling alignment of the scope of 4IR research with the scope of 4IR phenomena—and bringing humans back into the loop.},

Companies that thrive on competitive bidding for a large portion of their revenue stream, such as with project-driven organizations, promote their delivery system as well as the outcomes or deliverables. What companies are now realizing is that the strategic focus should be on creating a high-performance organization rather than just high-performance teams. Some countries establish laws that provide limitations on how much, if any, of the financial resources that the country possesses can leave the country. Companies that wish to do business within these countries must abide by these laws even if the laws seem improper. Sustainable strategic project management success requires a cooperative culture where team members work together and make decisions in the best interest of the firm. Projects are becoming clear strategic change and transformation vehicles. The chapter covers a multitude of the required dimensions of strategic agility.}
