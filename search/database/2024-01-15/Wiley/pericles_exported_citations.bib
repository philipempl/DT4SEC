abstract = {Abstract Due to the fierce competitive global market, enterprises need to face and overcome new challenges and requirements to stay ahead of competition. Cyber-physical systems, Internet of things, and digital twins are some of the contemporary technologies that are used in the context of Industry 4.0 in order to instill intelligence into the industrial sector by changing traditional manufacturing to smart manufacturing. The digitalized and interconnected nature of Industry 4.0 creates new security, privacy, and safety challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to be fully realized. This study presents an overview regarding the use of digital twins as a means to reinforce and secure cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0, in general. Digital twins connect the physical and virtual worlds and can be used in combination with other technologies to provide several merits in various sectors, such as real-time monitoring and controlling, prompt access to dynamic data, constant visualization and analysis, process optimization, advanced decision-making, and prediction systems. All in all, based on the literature review, digital twins can constitute an essential tool for the realization, reinforcement, and security of cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0.},

abstract = {Summary Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are hybrid systems comprising multiple components and many other combinations of various integrated but heterogeneous computational and physical capabilities. Todays embedded system such as iPhones and smart watches have integrated hardware and software solutions. There are engineering methodologies available to develop such embedded systems, focusing on the system. While their use at a personal level is much understood, what is less understood, and a topic of ongoing research is the question of what happens when such systems are deployed across multiple sectors, such as intelligent transportation systems, Internet of Things, smart medical devices, and many more, and used in activities not originally intended by the designers, for example, controlling the physical devices such as an automobile or an electricity power generation plant. This cross-sector deployment and the collective use of such systems introduces risk at the macro-system level that may have cascaded impacts in a highly networked environment, which further impact the constituent systems themselves. This is a major problem. One possibility to reduce the technical risk is to remotely control the systems in the cyber environments, but the sheer number of variables and possible situations introduce complexity at multiple scales. This complexity results in test plans with limited coverage. Additional cyber physical system related issues of intelligence, adaptation, autonomy, and security make the problem even worse. The proposed solution is the enhanced use of Modeling and Simulation (M\&S). The M\&S discipline has supported the development of complex systems since its inception. This chapter provides an overview on the M\&S methods and technologies that aid CPS engineering in the development and testing phases, and CPS governance when they are deployed in complex cyber environments.}

These environments are increasingly complex and challenging workspaces due to increasing levels of automation and data availability. An effective system design requires suitable frameworks that consider human activities and needs whilst supporting overall system efficacy. Although several reviews of frameworks for technology were identified, none of these focused on the human in the system (moving towards Industry 5). The critical literature review presented provides a summary of HCPS frameworks, maps the considerations for a human in HCPS, and provides insight for future framework and system development. The challenges, recommendations, and areas for further research are discussed.}

With the development of digitisation and digitalisation, aÂ large number of data acquisition equipment, computing equipment, and electrical equipment are interconnected between the power grid and the information communication network. The power grid has thus been restructured as a mature and highly complex CPS. In order to promote the development of power grid CPS technologies and provide a reference for relevant researchers in the field, the origin and concept of CPS and features in power grid CPS are introduced firstly. Then the key technologies of power grid CPS simulation are discussed and further analysed from three perspectives, including modelling theory, simulation methods, and system-level simulation. On this basis, the application of CPS simulation technology in future power grids has been prospected.}

The emphasis is on how the digital twin can be designed to deliver common use cases. From an architecture standpoint, a digital twin is a collection of several different software services, applications and data stores. In this chapter, we will first review how the physical object can be connected to the digital twin through the Internet of Things (IoT) and then see a layered view of the digital twin solution architecture. A description of the layered view and components in each layer will follow. An explanation of the data flow across digital twin components will show how various components work together. The digital twin solution architecture is explained through various viewpoints including data stores, user experience, integration with external applications, application programming interface (API), and cyber security. The solution architecture is presented at a conceptual level and is not tied to a framework, platform, or solution from a particular vendor. Concepts in the digital twin solution architecture are illustrated through examples from the world of discrete manufacturing.}

abstract = {Summary A digital twin is a cyber-clone or a cyber-representation of a physically existing real product or process that serves as its real-time digital counterpart. It is a concept formed due to the continuous evolution of computer-aided product design and engineering. The creation of digital twins results from continuous improvement in product design and engineering activities. Over the years, new product development has progressed from manual drafting to CAD/CAE. Now it is evolving toward model-based-systems engineering. The basis of any digital twin depends on the digital thread, which forms the basic design of the product it represents in the cyber world. Whenever the product requires design changes, the change in the digital thread is initiated, and the design parameters being affected are studied. Then there will be subsequent changes in the real product through engineering change orders. The physical vehicle, the virtual vehicle twin, and the connections between these entities comprise the digital twin concept in automotive vehicles. Data that flow from the physical vehicle to the digital vehicle and information available from the digital vehicle to the physical environment are the connections between the physical vehicle and its virtual vehicle twin. The proposed chapter discusses different types of digital twins, such as digital twin prototypes, product digital twin, production digital twins, and performance digital twins and their applications in the automotive domain. It also explains the different levels of digital twins, such as descriptive twin, informative twin, predictive twin, comprehensive twin, and autonomous twin, which are essential during the product's lifecycle. State-of-the-art digital twin applications in the automotive domain are discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges in adoption. The feasibility of adopting digital twin technology across the different functions and structures is analyzed considering the current and anticipated commercial and technological opportunities and issues of automotive OEMs.}

The paper then discusses the use of IoT and digital twin technology for effective energy management with applications in smart homes, smart buildings, smart grids, smart industries (Industry 4.0), smart transportation and smart cities. Additionally, the paper explores the use of IoT and digital twin technology for condition monitoring and diagnosis (CMD) in electrical power systems. Three different cases are presented for CMD, that is, CMD of power transformers, CMD of electrical grids and CMD of substations. IoT and digital twin applications are also highlighted in power electronic systems. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of applying IoT and digital twin technology to electrical power systems and provides recommendations for future research.},

Taking the advantages of digital twin on near-real-time interaction between the physical and cyber systems, the framework, operation, and enabled technologies of digital twin smart freeway (DTSF) are developed in this paper. A three-layer conceptual framework is first discussed for understanding the fundamental structure, core components, and operation procedure of a DTSF system in the context of smart transportation. The key technologies of a DTSF system are also investigated, such as simulation modelling, big data analysis, intelligent prediction, and integrated freeway control. Moreover, a well-designed case study based on Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed freeway control strategy by integrating perimeter control of upstream urban network and traffic regulation of freeway segments. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to investigate integrated freeway control under the framework of digital twin.},

Despite this relatively wide time, a clear definition of âIndustry 4.0â has not been given yet, or more precisely, not uniformly adopted. Multiple technologies are seen as enabling for this fourth industrial revolution, providing truly new grounds to build and develop the factories of the future. Between the vast variety of such technologies, Internet of Things surely represents one of the most significant ones. Its potential is enormous since it could contribute along with the Industrial Internet to digitalize production processes. A structured analysis on the different hardware and software components of such technologies would be of major help for the practitioners and researchers as a guide to adequately assess, compare and select the most appropriate techniques for the specific industrial problem to face in the context of Internet of Things, Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {The âInternet of thingsâ is the ânew revolutionâ. During the past decades, there were major changes in the energy industry: the increased implementation of renewable generation, together with a greater use of electronic power elements in the network such as high-voltage DC links and the use of flexible AC transmission system and new market requirements, introduce new challenges and a need for more intelligent assets monitoring; and additional optimisation with a better balance in the combination of different energy sources and thus guaranteeing the reliability of supply and quality of energy; together with the identification of new business models that allow the integration of new technologies, neutralising cyber threats and ensure an adequate dissemination of knowledge to new generations. Companies are migrating to a more digital model based fundamentally on three pillars: communications, big data and artificial intelligence. The right combination of these three pillars will optimise the operation of the electrical system, reducing costs and polluting emissions, accelerating the adoption of non-polluting energies and renewable energies, while maximising economic performance and a closer way of interacting with users. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has been identified as one of the technologies with most potential impact in the next years.},

abstract = {Summary The ongoing global digital transformation, inspired by the Industry 4.0 initiative, has brought new concepts and emerging technologies. The digital twin (DT) technology is one of these innovative notions that has recently gained more attention. The DT idea attempts to allow smart factories by providing a link between real and virtual systems and digital reproduction or representation of the physical system. The data is gathered, analyzed, and fed into the simulated virtual model in order to forecast and enhance the physical system's performance. However, there are a number of obstacles to overcome in the development of the technology, including data analytics and data privacy. This article focused on the potential and challenges of DT technology that should possess in Industry 4.0. Exploration of the DT in the context of Industry 4.0 will aid future research and development.}

abstract = {Abstract Digital twin (DT) technology has been a topic with academic and industrial coverage in recent years. DTs are intended to be a virtual high-fidelity representation of a physical counterpart. Its complex nature requires several components to create and run a DT, and that is why many DT frameworks have been proposed in the literature. There are also many surveys of DTs, but none that is bottom-up with concrete examples and focused on open-source software. This survey analyzes 14 open-source DT frameworks in 10 different dimensions, which are then categorized in six different groups according to their modeling and technological domain, to present the reader different options for creating and managing DT applications, and to understand potential combinations, uses, and limitations of the tools. It also presents a case study with five of the explored DT frameworks, describing the process on how the DT is set up and comparing their capabilities based on the services to be provided by the DT. Finally, it discusses advantages and limitations of the tools according to domain, requirements, and scope, relevant aspects regarding built-in simulations and data analytics, theory-to-practice transition, and advantages/disadvantages of using open-source software instead of commercial. Main limitations of the study due to its narrow niche, conclusions, and opportunities for future research regarding the potential room for improvement in terms of out-of-the-box features and services for DTs, are also shown.}

abstract = {Abstract A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical product, asset, process, system, or service that allows us to understand, predict, and optimise their performance for better business outcomes. Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.},
