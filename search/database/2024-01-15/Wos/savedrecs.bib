Abstract = {There are some problems in the security management of large stadiums,
   such as complex situations and a lack of coordination among systems. An
   intelligent security system can effectively improve the efficiency of
   security management. The digital twin concept is applied to intelligent
   security systems in large stadiums, and an intelligent security modeling
   method for large stadiums based on digital twin is proposed. The
   modeling method of the physical model is presented for the security
   equipment and building entities. The virtual model is based on
   geometric, physical, behavioral, and rule models. Considering the
   particularity of building security, the environmental model is added to
   describe the environmental information. The application mode of the
   digital twin model is proposed. In the security management process,
   multi-source data and virtual models are integrated to analyze and
   control the security management process of buildings, forming a closed
   loop of ``perception-analysis-control{''} in security management. Taking
   the National Sliding Center as an example, this paper verifies the
   digital twin model and its operation mode of intelligent building
   security through several possible situations in the operation process of
   the stadium. The analysis of security data and evacuation path guidance
   in emergencies are simulated. The digital twin model for intelligent
   security integrated the building security data and simulation models to
   assist in identifying the types of dangers and the treatment of
   emergencies. Furthermore, the control of building equipment was
   integrated into the security system. The digital twin model for
   intelligent security improved the integration and intelligence of the
   security system.},

Abstract = {The digital twin is a rather new industrial control and automation
   systems concept. While the approach so far has gained interest mainly
   due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations,
   recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention
   within the research community. In this article, we discuss how a digital
   twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be
   used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes.
   We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based
   data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state
   synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization
   requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other
   security components of the architecture. We also make performance
   evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using
   the proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides a
   foundation for future research work in this promising new area.},

Abstract = {Most intelligent systems focused on how to improve performance including
   accuracy, processing speed with a massive number of data sets and those
   performance-biased intelligent systems, Red AI systems, have been

   toward Green AI-enabled digital twin service, which provides
   eco-friendly security by the active participation of low resource
   devices. And, we formally define a problem whose objective is to
   maximize the participation of low source or reusable devices such that
   reusable surveillance borders are created within security district.
   Also, a dense sub-district with low resource devices priority completion
   scheme is proposed to resolve the problem. Then, the devised method is
   performed by expanded simulations and the achieved result is evaluated

Abstract = {Industry 4.0 is having an increasingly positive impact on the value
   chain by modernizing and optimizing the production and distribution
   processes. In this streamline, the digital twin (DT) is one of the most
   cutting-edge technologies of Industry 4.0, providing simulation
   capabilities to forecast, optimize and estimate states and
   configurations. In turn, these technological capabilities are
   encouraging industrial stakeholders to invest in the new paradigm,
   though an increased focus on the risks involved is really needed. More
   precisely, the deployment of a DT is based on the composition of
   technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of
   Things, edge computing, virtualization infrastructures, artificial
   intelligence and big data. However, the confluence of all these
   technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart
   of the DT in the real world generate multiple security threats that have
   not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes
   the current state of the DT paradigm and classifies the potential
   threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality
   layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more
   complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of
   security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the
   appropriate and trustworthy use of a DT.},

   safety and security digital twins in buildings, explore the benefits and

   different lifecycle stages of a building. This paper contributes to the
   creation and study of a digital twin for fire safety, analyzing its

Title = {Digital Twin of Food Supply Chain for Cyber Exercises},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The food supply chain is a critical part of modern societies. As with
   other facets of life, it is thoroughly digitalized, and uses network
   connections. Consequently, the cyber security of the supply chain
   becomes a major concern as new threats emerge. Cyber ranges can be used
   to prepare for such cyber security threats by creating realistic
   scenarios mimicking real-world systems and setups. Organizations can
   participate in cyber security training and exercises that present them
   with these scenarios. Cyber ranges can also be used efficiently for
   research and development activities, because cyber ranges are realistic
   environments and can be used for the generation of realistic data. The
   aim of this study is to describe a digital twin of the food supply chain
   built for cyber range-based cyber security exercises. The digital twin
   mirrors the real-world situation with sufficient detail, as required by
   the cyber exercise. This research uses the design science methodology,
   which describes the construction and evaluation of the proposed system.
   The study explains the general capabilities of the food supply chain
   digital twin and its use in the cyber range environment. Different parts
   of the supply chain are implemented as Node.js services that run on the
   Realistic Global Cyber Environment (RGCE) platform. The flow of
   ingredients and products is simulated using an apparatus model and
   message queues. The digital twin was demonstrated in a real live cyber
   exercise. The results indicate that the apparatus approach was a
   scalable and realistic enough way to implement the digital twin. The
   main limitations of the implemented system are the implementation on one
   specific platform, and the need for more feedback from multiple
   exercises. Creation of a digital twin enables the use of cyber ranges to
   train organizations related to the food supply chain.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Due to its unique type of services, Cloud Computing could operate as a
   ``base technology{''} for other technologies; this attracts researchers
   to develop sustainable Cloud systems. It is a new generation of services
   that offers an opportunity for users to access and manage their
   information, applications, and data regardless of place and time.
   Nevertheless, there is a type of service that can include large amounts
   of data, called Big Data, and it consists of the rapid use of the
   Internet of Things (IoT) to produce large data sets. In this work,
   initially, we present Cloud Computing (CC) and Big Data (BD) exported
   from IoT, focusing on the security and management challenges of both.
   Notably, we combine the two aforementioned technologies to examine their
   related characteristics and discover new perspectives and opportunities
   for their integration and to achieve a sustainable environment called a
   Digital Twin scenario. Subsequently, we present how Cloud Computing
   contributes to IoT-based Big Data, aiming to fill a scientific gap in
   the sector of their integration regarding security and privacy. Finally,
   we additionally survey the security challenges of the integrated model
   of BD and CC and then propose a novel security algorithm for sustainable
   Cloud systems in a Digital Twin scenario. The experimental results
   presented are based on the use of the encryption algorithms AES, RC5,
   and RSA, and our proposed model extends the advances of CC and IoT-based
   BD, offering a highly novel and scalable service platform to achieve
   better privacy and security services.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin is a way to virtually represent or model a physical object
   using the real time data. This innovation sets up a way to deal with
   industries and organizations to supervise their products, consequently
   bridging the gap between design and implementations. As the name
   suggests, ``Digital Twin{''} infers that a reproduction of the product
   is made in order to have a nearby relationship with the live item. The
   procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data,
   processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive
   investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally
   enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their
   product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering
   information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could
   store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the
   intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the
   successful working of the products geographically distributed. The
   impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital
   twin.
   The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of
   utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as
   they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use.
   Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of
   manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The
   effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for
   activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened. This approach
   can help reduce the workload and furthermore can get trained on the
   virtual machine without the need of a specific training.
   With the most prevailing technologies of today, like Artificial
   Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things more prominent
   approach to train and monitor products, taking care of its own
   execution, collaborating to different frameworks, performing
   self-repairs are made possible. Hence the future is getting unfolded
   with the emerging DIGITAL TWIN era. The massive data utilized in the
   field of digital twin is prone to severe security breaches. Thus digital
   twin technology should be handled with extreme care so as to protect the
   data. Hence, this chapter identifies the ways and means of collecting,
   organizing and storing the data in a secured cloud environment. The data
   is filtered according to the use and priority and pushed into the cloud.
   It is determined to implement an exclusive algorithm for a secured cloud
   which would greatly benefit the users and the providers to handle and
   process it effectively.},

Abstract = {With the flourishing and advancement of autonomous vehicles, the
   vehicular digital twin (VDT) has become an emerging paradigm, consisting
   of inter-twin communication and intra-twin communication. VDT can
   effectively address the current shortcomings of the autonomous vehicle
   and provide enhanced and scalable services to the users. Nevertheless,
   strict security and privacy concerns arise, as VDT collects a wide range
   of privacy-sensitive information of the users in real-time and is
   exposed to an open network environment in both physical and virtual
   horizons. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy of
   VDT. We first describe the vehicular digital twin network architecture
   in detail and then investigate some VDT-related applications. After
   that, we discuss the security and privacy issues in VDT. Finally, we put
   forward several potential countermeasures and open research issues for
   VDT from the perspective of security and privacy. We expect this work
   will bring more attention to further investigation on security and
   privacy solutions for vehicular digital twin networks.},

Title = {An Effective Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Assisted Security Protocol
   for Cloud-Based Digital Twin Environment},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {26877-26892},
Abstract = {Recently, the Digital Twin (DT) technology has procured a lot of
   attention because of its applicability in the manufacturing and space
   industries. The DT environment involves the formation of a clone of the
   tangible object to perform simulations in the virtual space. The
   combination of conceptual development, predictive maintenance, real-time
   monitoring, and simulation characteristics of DT has increased the
   utilization of DT in different scenarios, such as medical environments,
   healthcare, manufacturing industries, aerospace, etc. However, these
   utilizations have also brought serious security pitfalls in DT
   deployment. Towards this, several authentication protocols with
   different security and privacy features for DT environments have been
   proposed. In this article, we first review a recently proposed
   two-factor authentication protocol for DT environments that utilizes the
   blockchain technology. However, the analyzed scheme is unable to offer
   the desirable security and cannot withstand various security attacks
   like offline password-guessing attack, smart card stolen attack,
   anonymity property, and known session-specific temporary information
   attack. We also demonstrate that an attacker can impersonate the
   analyzed protocol's legal user, owner, and cloud server. To mitigate
   these security loopholes, we devise an effective three-factor
   privacy-preserving authentication scheme for DT environments. The
   proposed work is demonstrated to be secure by performing the informal
   security analysis, the formal security analysis using the widely
   recognized Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and the Real-or-Random
   (ROR) model. A detailed comparative study on existing competing schemes
   including the analyzed scheme demonstrates that the devised framework
   furnishes better security features while also having lower computation
   costs and comparable communication costs than the existing schemes.},

Abstract = {The emergence of Industry 5.0 has highlighted the significance of
   information usage, processing, and data analysis when maintaining
   physical assets. This has enabled the creation of the Digital Twin (DT).
   Information about an asset is generated and consumed during its entire
   life cycle. The main goal of DT is to connect and represent physical
   assets as close to reality as possible virtually. Unfortunately, the
   lack of security and trust among DT participants remains a problem as a
   result of data sharing. This issue cannot be resolved with a central
   authority when dealing with large organisations. Blockchain technology
   has been proposed as a solution for DT information sharing and security
   challenges. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based solution for digital
   twin using Ethereum blockchain with performance and cost analysis. This
   solution employs a smart contract for information management and access
   control for stakeholders of the digital twin, which is secure and
   tamper-proof. This implementation is based on Ethereum and IPFS. We use
   IPFS storage servers to store stakeholders' details and manage
   information. A real-world use-case of a production line of a smartphone,
   where a conveyor belt is used to carry different parts, is presented to
   demonstrate the proposed system. The performance evaluation of our
   proposed system shows that it is secure and achieves performance
   improvement when compared with other methods. The comparison of results
   with state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed system consumed
   fewer resources in a transaction cost, with an 8\% decrease. The
   execution cost increased by 10\%, but the cost of ether was 93\% less
   than the existing methods.},

Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on communication and control
   technologies to efficiently manage devices in the system. However, a
   wide variety of potential security challenges has emerged due to the
   evolution of critical infrastructures (CI) from siloed sub-systems into
   integrated networks, including smart grid (SG). SG security studies are
   carried out on physical test-beds to train and test cyber attacks in a
   safe/controlled environment. However, it has limitations w.r.t modifying
   physical configuration and scalability. To overcome these shortcomings,
   we built a digital power twin for a physical test-bed that is used for
   cyber security studies on SGs. The twin enable users to deploy real
   world attacks and countermeasures, and study its effectiveness. In the
   twin users may easily modify the components and configurations unlike in
   a physical test-bed. Further, reproducing the twin for advancing the
   research is significantly cheaper. We illustrate the typical use case
   with an example case study.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {472-485},
Abstract = {In the digital twin environment, the fusion data onto physical entities
   in the physical space are mapped to multiple virtual spaces for digital
   modeling and intelligent simulation in different dimensions. In real
   intelligent manufacturing scenarios, heterogeneous multi-source fusion
   data are collected at the same time period. So they are consistent in
   time state. For the autonomous digital twin system, time states
   verification and integrity checking are basic security factors. Provable
   data possession technology can check the integrity of data onto virtual
   spaces. The blockchain can provide the synchronization interface to make
   distributed entities to obtain the trusted time state value. Considering
   the privacy, the blockchain can also provide anonymous services for
   entities. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based synchronized
   provable data possession scheme (named BSPDP) for digital twin. In our
   scheme, the selection of verifier is flexible. Since virtual spaces may
   be maliciously framed to pay compensation, we use tag verification to
   prevent honest virtual spaces from being framed. Under the assumption of
   RSA, the proposed BSPDP is provably secure. Finally, the performance
   analysis demonstrates that BSPDP is practical. The experimental results
   show that BSPDP is effective and attractive for digital twin.},

   its behavior through real-time data management and bidirectional
   interaction. The power grid has seen reliable access to information with
   the deployment of the Internet of Things, which has equipped it with a
   powerful tool for real-time data management and analysis. This paper
   aims to propose practical ideas and trace the continuous investigation
   of DT technology for power systems, including transportation systems,
   smart grids, and microgrids. The challenges associated with the
   deployment of DT technology are also discussed. As cities continue to
   develop, multi-dimensional energy management systems face various
   challenges, such as real-time management, planning, and analysis of
   transportation systems and remote data transfer within power grids.
   These challenges can be addressed by implementing a real twin framework
   in each section. Additionally, this paper discusses the security of DT
   technology based on machine learning and provides a comprehensive view
   for readers to develop and deploy DT technology for various power system
   applications.},

Title = {Security Analysis of a Digital Twin Framework Using Probabilistic Model
   Checking},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {26358-26374},
Abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) have been gaining popularity in various
   applications, such as smart manufacturing, smart energy, smart mobility,
   and smart healthcare. In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual
   replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of
   three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and
   the connections between them. While the data is collected from a
   physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the
   form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security
   risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to
   understand these security risks and their implications. However, there
   is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a
   DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be
   analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework
   captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers
   various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is
   represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are
   captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used
   to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the
   framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of
   various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system.
   The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the
   help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality-embedded digital twin (VR-DT) service integrates digital
   twin with virtual reality to visualize the digital representation of
   real-world production, boosting the digital transformation of
   manufacturing industry in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
   Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven,
   computing-intensive, and security-sensitive features bring challenges to
   the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed
   resource allocation scheme to improve the average Quality of Service
   (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction
   throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment,
   subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation, and block size
   adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A fully
   decentralized multiagent compound-action actor-critic algorithm is
   developed to solve the QoS optimization problem. Simulation results
   demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently improve the average
   QoS of the VR-DT services in a realizable way as compared to existing
   schemes.},

Abstract = {The integration of digital twin (DT) and 6G edge intelligence provides

   However, the adverse impact of model poisoning attacks on DT model
   training cannot be ignored. To address this issue, we firstly construct
   the models of DT model training and model poisoning attacks. An
   optimiza-tion problem is formulated to minimize the weighted sum of the
   DT loss function and DT model training delay. Then, the problem is
   transformed and solved by the proposed Multi-timescAle endogenouS
   securiTy-aware DQN-based rEsouRce management algorithm (MASTER) based on
   DT-assisted state information evaluation and attack detection. MASTER
   adopts multi-timescale deep Q-learning (DQN) networks to jointly
   schedule local training epochs and devices. It actively adjusts resource
   management strategies based on estimated attack probability to achieve
   endoge-nous security awareness. Simulation results demon-strate that
   MASTER has excellent performances in DT model training accuracy and

Abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin
   is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect
   physical components with digital space for better optimization of
   physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security
   concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this
   article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge
   networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin
   construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an
   access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing
   digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network
   operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging
   directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model
   updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to
   help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and
   also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update
   verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint
   cooperative federated learning and local model update verification
   scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and
   local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare.
   Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in
   digital twin construction.},

Abstract = {Emerging digital twin (DT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC) are crucial
   for enabling the rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works
   ignore the edge collaboration, which can provide the system with
   additional performance gain. In this article, we study the problem of
   mobile users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative
   mobile-edge servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a
   DT-assisted task offloading scheme (DTTOS) that consists of the
   selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel
   state information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the
   selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU's task
   offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an
   intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at
   decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the
   complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved
   by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep-Q-learning (DDQN),
   respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the
   proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network
   performance improvement.},

Abstract = {This study delves into the critical issue of Digital Twin (DT)
   technology standardization, focusing on introducing a novel approach
   called ``correspondence measure.{''} We draw upon extensive literature
   review and case study analyses to investigate existing standardization
   methods, identifying sector-specific and problem-specific strategies. We
   also underline the importance of interoperability, data privacy and
   security, real-time synchronization, and accuracy and fidelity in the
   standardization of DTs. Unveiling the intricacies of the
   ``correspondence measure,{''} we elucidate its potential in enhancing
   the standardization process by providing a standardized measure of the
   accuracy and reliability of a digital twin concerning its physical
   counterpart. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of our proposed
   method in various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, aerospace,
   maritime and shipping, and city management. Our findings suggest that
   the ``correspondence measure{''} can significantly contribute to the
   existing standardization approaches by facilitating a better
   understanding of the DT's behavior, thereby fostering trust in these
   digital replications. This paper not only offers a theoretical
   contribution to the literature on DT standardization but also provides
   practical insights for the stakeholders involved in developing,
   implementing, and managing digital twins.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that replicates any physical
   phenomenon from a physical space to a digital space in congruence with
   the physical state. However, devising a Healthcare DT model for patient
   care is seen as a challenging task as the lack of adequate data
   collection structure. There are also security and privacy concerns as
   healthcare data is very sensitive and can be used in malicious ways.
   Because of these current research gaps, the proper way of acquiring the
   structured data and managing them in a secure way is very important. In
   this article, we present a mathematical data model to accumulate the
   patient relevant data in a structured and predefined way with proper
   delineation. Additionally, the provided data model is described in
   harmony with real life contexts. Then, we have used the patient centric
   mathematical data model to formally define the semantic and scope of our
   proposed Healthcare Digital Twin (HDT) system based on Blockchain.
   Accordingly, the proposed system is described with all the key
   components as well as with detailed protocol flows and an analysis of
   its different aspects. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model
   with a critical comparison with other relevant research works have been
   provided.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the diffusion of integrated design environments and tools for
   visual threat modeling for critical infrastructures, the concept of
   Digital Twin (DT) is gaining momentum in the field of cybersecurity. Its
   main use is for enabling attack simulations and evaluation of
   countermeasures, without causing outage of the physical system. However,
   the use of a DT is considered foremost as a facilitator of system
   operation rather than an integral part of its architecture design. In
   this work, we introduce a specific architecture view in the system
   representation, called Cybersecurity View. From it, we derive a
   cybersecurity Digital Twin as part of the security-by-design practice
   for Industrial Automation and Control Systems used in Critical
   Infrastructures. Not only this digital twin serves the purpose of
   simulating cyber-attacks and devising countermeasures, but its design
   and function are also directly tied to the architecture model of the
   system for which the cybersecurity requirements are posed. Moreover,
   this holds regardless of whether the model is generated as part of the
   development cycle or through an empirical observation of the system
   as-is. With this, we enable the identification of adequate cybersecurity
   measures for the system, while improving the overall system design. To
   demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed methodology, its
   application is illustrated through two real-world use cases: the
   Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) and the Road tunnel
   scenario.},

Abstract = {Predictive maintenance of wind turbines plays a crucial part in
   directing power grid dispatching and maintaining power grid security. In
   this paper, a way of ultra-short term wind power prediction relied on
   digital twin technology is proposed, which realizes actual time and
   accurate wind power prediction by building a digital model. Firstly, BP
   neural network (back propagation neutral network) was used to predict
   the wind power, and the initial predicted value of wind power was
   obtained. Then the meteorological data was substituted into the
   historical meteorological database to find similar meteorological
   conditions data, and the BP neural network predicted value was weighted
   to get the final digital twin predicted value. The simulation results
   indicate that this method can effectively enhance prediction accuracy of
   wind power. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access

Title = {Digital Twin-Based Safety Risk Coupling of Prefabricated Building
   Hoisting},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Safety management in hoisting is the key issue to determine the
   development of prefabricated building construction. However, the
   security management in the hoisting stage lacks a truly effective method
   of information physical fusion, and the safety risk analysis of hoisting
   does not consider the interaction of risk factors. In this paper, a
   hoisting safety risk management framework based on digital twin (DT) is
   presented. The digital twin hoisting safety risk coupling model is
   built. The proposed model integrates the Internet of Things (IoT),
   Building Information Modeling (BIM), and a security risk analysis method
   combining the Apriori algorithm and complex network. The real-time
   perception and virtual-real interaction of multi-source information in
   the hoisting process are realized, the association rules and coupling
   relationship among hoisting safety risk factors are mined, and the
   time-varying data information is visualized. Demonstration in the
   construction of a large-scale prefabricated building shows that with the
   proposed framework, it is possible to complete the information fusion
   between the hoisting site and the virtual model and realize the visual
   management. The correlative relationship among hoisting construction
   safety risk factors is analyzed, and the key control factors are found.
   Moreover, the efficiency of information integration and sharing is
   improved, the gap of coupling analysis of security risk factors is
   filled, and effective security management and decision-making are
   achieved with the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date
   virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in
   most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize
   the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use
   of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the
   dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a
   Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360 degrees camera
   and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The
   Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by
   constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360
   degrees live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature
   and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other
   purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using
   a 360 degrees web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object
   detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured
   stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an
   identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the
   corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these
   objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost
   importance to many other services and domains such as national security.
   To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and
   conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection
   and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness
   of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step
   forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart
   mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies such as blockchain and digital twins are essential
   for the rapid development and employment in Industry 5.0 revolution.
   With the growing number of industrial IoT nodes, optimizing the network
   and availing of limited resources to enable secure transmission is
   difficult. A digital twin is the virtual representation of a physical
   device that completely depends on sensor data for the critical
   decision-making simulation process. To this end, we combine a
   blockchain-based distributed network with a digital twin for the
   Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. This paper proposes a
   blockchain-based Proof of Authority (PoA) trust mechanism to provide
   high-quality services such as security and data privacy in IIoT.
   Furthermore, to enhance the authority of decentralized digital twin
   combined blockchain networks, we introduce a Deterministic Pseudo-Random
   Generation (DPRG) to generate a genesis block. To evaluate the
   trustworthiness of the proposed system, we simulate the blockchain
   network with a digital twin using IIoT sensor nodes. The simulation
   result shows that the PoA-based authority master nodes can reduce energy
   consumption and enhance data security.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {5G networks require dynamic network monitoring and advanced security
   solutions. This work performs the essential steps to implement a basic
   5G digital twin (DT) in a warehouse scenario. This study provides a
   paradigm of end-to-end connection and encryption to internet of things
   (IoT) devices. Network function virtualization (NFV) technologies are
   crucial to connecting and encrypting IoT devices. Innovative logistical
   scenarios are undergoing constant changes in logistics, and higher
   deployment of IoT devices in logistic scenarios, such as warehouses,
   demands better communication capabilities. The simulation tools enable
   digital twin network implementation in planning. Altair Feko (WinProp)
   simulates the radio behavior of a typical warehouse framework. The radio
   behavior can be exported as a radio simulation dataset file. This
   dataset file represents the virtual network's payload. GNS3, an
   open-source network simulator, performs data payload transmission among
   clients to servers using custom NFV components. By transmitting data
   from client to server, we achieved end-to-end communication.
   Additionally, custom NFV components enable advanced encryption standard
   (AES) adoption. In summary, this work analyzes the round-trip time (RTT)
   and throughput of the payload data packages, in which two data packages,
   encrypted and non-encrypted, are observed.},

Abstract = {With the continuous expansion of the scale of the power grid and the
   growth of the demand for electricity, the digital and intelligent
   construction of distribution grids is urgently needed for the
   development of power systems. The technology system formed by digital
   twin technology based on high-precision data collection, real-time data
   transmission, digital modelling and analysis, big data simulation and
   decision-making, and intelligent and precise execution can effectively
   provide new ideas for the digital transformation of the distribution
   grid. This article describes the five-layer architecture of digital twin
   technology in the distribution grid field and analyses specific
   applications in condition assessment, real-time monitoring, and load
   forecasting. The characteristics of digital twin technology are
   summarized as digital operation and maintenance, visual observation,
   deductive simulation, and personalized interaction. The challenges
   regarding sensors, intelligent algorithms, and modelling standards faced
   by the application of digital twin technology to distribution grids are
   presented. The future development trend of digital twin technology in
   the field of distribution grids is forecasted. The important role of
   sensor technology, data fusion and sharing, cloud and embedded
   computing, reliability of algorithms, modelling standardization and
   effective cyber security measures are proposed in the digital twin
   technology of distribution grids. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,
   and makes application of technologies and advanced data processing
   techniques in agricultural field possible. Digital farming aims to use
   available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing
   challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and
   resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex,
   dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital
   approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further
   decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual
   representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity
   and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review
   describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with
   different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts.
   It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,
   robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in
   agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial
   intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and
   communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies)
   of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can
   support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by
   continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and
   updating the state of virtual world.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art digital
   twin and digital thread technology in industrial operations. Both are
   transformational technologies that have the advantage of improving the
   efficiency of current design and manufacturing. Digital twin is an
   important element of the Industry 4.0 digitalization process; however,
   the huge amount of data that are generated and collected by a digital
   twin offer challenges in handling, processing and storage. The paper
   aims to report on the development of a new framework that combines the
   digital twin and digital thread for better data management in order to
   drive innovation, improve the production process and performance and
   ensure continuity and traceability of information. The digital
   twin/thread framework incorporates behavior simulation and physical
   control components, in which these two components rely on the
   connectivity between the twin and thread for information flow and
   exchange to drive innovation. The twin/thread framework encompasses
   specifications that include organizational architecture layout,
   security, user access, databases and hardware and software requirements.
   It is envisaged that the framework will be applicable to enhancing the

Volume = {61},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of digital twin technology, a large amount of
   digital twin data named as big digital twin data (BDTD), is generated in
   the lifecycle of equipment, which is supposed to be used in digital twin
   enabled applications. However, in the implementation of these
   applications, data sharing problem which is caused by the lack of data
   security as well as trust among stakeholders of equipment, limits data
   using value. It is a novel way to introduce blockchain technology into
   digital twin to solve the problem. However, current methods cannot
   fulfill the requirements of exponential growth and timely sharing of
   BDTD. Therefore, a blockchain-based framework for secure sharing of BDTD
   is proposed to solve the problems. Cloud storage is integrated into the
   framework, with which, BDTD is encrypted and stored in Cloud, while the
   hash of BDTD and transaction records are stored in blockchain. Some
   rules of generating new block are designed to improve the processing
   speed of blockchain. An algorithm for optimal sampling rate selection is
   presented to maximize total social benefits of the participants of BDTD
   sharing. Simulation results show that the algorithm is better than
   traditional method for maximizing the total social benefits.
   Furthermore, a protype system is developed and evaluated based on Fabric
   test network. Evaluation results show that BDTD can be shared securely
   multiple times per second through the framework, which demonstrates the
   feasibility of the framework in supporting timely sharing of BDTD.},

Abstract = {Digital twin for the industrial Internet of Things (DT-IIoT) creates a
   high-fidelity, fine-grained, low-cost digital replica of the
   cyber-physical integrated Internet for industry. Powered by artificial
   intelligence (AI) and security technologies, DT-IIoT provides advanced
   features such as real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, remote
   diagnostics, and rapid response for smart IIoT systems. A systematic
   review of key enabling technologies such as digital twin, AI, and
   blockchain is essential to develop DT-IIoT and reveal pitfalls. This
   paper reviews the preliminaries, real-world applications, architectures
   and models of digital twin-driven IIoT. In addition, advanced
   technologies for intelligent and secure DT-IIoT are investigated,
   including state-of-the-art AI solutions such as transfer learning and
   federated learning, as well as blockchain-based security solutions.
   Moreover, software tools for high-fidelity digital twin modeling are
   proposed. A case study on reinforcement learning-based
   integrated-control, communication, and computing (3C) design is
   developed to demonstrate the AI-driven intelligent DT-IIoT. Finally,
   this paper outlines the prospective applications, challenges, and
   integrations with ABCDE (i.e., AI, Blockchain, cloud computing, big

Abstract = {The convergence with the emerging digital twin technology has been
   envisaged as the looming of a smart cloud-based healthcare system.
   Precision clone simulation of the patients and medical service builds a
   bridge to the virtual medical world, enabling diagnosing, monitoring,
   and future prediction to offer enhanced medical services. Cloud services
   provider plays a crucial role in endowing a way to interlink the
   physical world to the virtual medical world through outsourced storage,
   a communication platform, reduced computational cost, and the relevance
   of hosting and other services over the internet offered by it. However,
   any alteration, deviation, or amendment of the physical patient's and
   its digital twin's stored data in the cloud storage has been one of the
   security liabilities. In this work, we propose a blockchain-assisted
   certificateless public auditing mechanism for the cloud-based digital
   twin healthcare networks to substantiate the data integrity in cloud
   storage. Blockchain in the proposed mechanism enables keeping the
   auditing process and outsourcing activities log. Meanwhile, it also
   enjoys the benefits of batch auditing and pairing-free operations. The
   proposed work is demonstrated to be provably secure and efficient in
   achieving security goals like storage correctness, privacy-preserving,
   and public verifiability. Furthermore, the computational overhead of the
   presented work is shown to be efficient with contrasted with some
   existing works.},

Title = {Atikokan Digital Twin: Machine learning in a biomass energy system},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {310},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The Atikokan Generating Station, operated by Ontario Power Generation,
   has a 200 MW, biomass-fired tower boiler that operates on a dispatch
   schedule with a five-minute cycle. The boiler is generally operated in
   the range of 40-100 MW using two of five burner levels. In order to
   optimize boiler performance, we propose the implementation of a unique
   digital twin. Our digital twin abstraction couples Bayesian inference
   from science based models and from observations (machine learning) with
   decision theory to predict operating-variable set points that optimize
   the physical asset (the boiler) in the presence of uncertainty
   (artificial intelligence). We focus this paper on the continuous
   Bayesian machine learning part of the Atikokan Digital Twin; we discuss
   decision theory in a companion paper. We identify and learn about 12
   operational, model, and measured-output parameters and their
   uncertainties from high-fidelity, science-based simulations of the
   Atikokan boiler and from the observed measurements at the power plant.
   Since the goal of the Atikokan Digital Twin is to implement it online in
   real time, we require fast function evaluations for the quantities of
   interest extracted from the simulations in the Bayesian analysis. We use
   Gaussian process regression/interpolation to create accurate, robust
   surrogate models. We define the Bayesian priors and likelihood function
   and solve for the posterior distributions of the 12 parameters. We then
   propagate these distributions (i.e., parameters with uncertainty) into
   the predicted distributions of 790 quantities of interest to learn about
   the relative importance of various sources of error including
   experimental, model, and operating-parameter errors.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology in the Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart cities to keep the health and
   reliability of various DT requesters, such as private vehicles, public
   transportation, energy systems, etc. The combination of DT and ITS can
   further release the potential of participants in smart cities and
   guarantee their efficiency and reliability. Despite the advantages of
   DT-enabled ITS, not all requesters need the same level of DT service due
   to the highly dynamic nature of ITS. Safe and reliable matching between
   DT and ITS still needs to be resolved. To address these issues, we
   propose the blockchain-enabled Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) for
   ITS. First, we propose an on-demand DTaaS architecture to fully utilize
   the sensing capabilities of ITS and the macro perspective of DT. Second,
   a double-auction model and a price adjustment algorithm are proposed to
   realize the optimal DT matching for ITS requesters and ensure the
   benefits of participants. Third, a permissioned blockchain and a novel
   DT-DPoS consensus mechanism are established to enhance the security and
   efficiency of DTaaS. Simulation shows that the proposed DTaaS and
   double-auction can efficiently stimulate and facilitate DT transactions.
   The proposed DT-DPoS also has obvious advantages.},

Title = {Design, development, and optimization of a conceptual framework of
   digital twin electric grid using systems engineering approach},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {226},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Apart from conventional centralized control and administration, power
   systems entered the smart grid era, whilst the burgeoning Industry 4.0
   demanded production and distribution in terms of digital data exchange
   and IoE (Internet of Everything)-based platforms. The usage of a digital
   twin in power system operation is an advanced version of IIoT
   (Industrial Internet of Things). In terms of a more secure and
   dependable grid network, interconnected cloud architecture and online
   remote administration provide effective vulnerability management. Yet,
   to fully exploit the promise of digital twin technology in the electric
   grid, a conceptual framework is required to define the critical parts
   and procedures involved in constructing and deploying a digital twin
   system. A conceptual framework based on systems engineering approaches
   is proposed in this paper which takes the electric grid's particular
   characteristics, such as system complexity, the necessity for real-time
   surveillance and control, and the significance of security and
   dependability into consideration. Accelerating the adoption of digital
   twin technologies in the electric grid can be made viable through the
   establishment of a well-defined and comprehensive development framework.
   This approach will contribute to the realization of a power system that
   is characterized by enhanced stability, efficiency, and sustainability.
   Considering the issue to be a multivariable optimization problem, a
   systems engineering approach is chosen based on component-based
   modeling, overall system configuration, and functional analysis.},

Abstract = {Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure
   efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the
   airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming
   increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including
   the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries,
   weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air
   cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan
   optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality
   system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for
   connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical
   operations and virtual space. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment
   (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment
   with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor
   data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal
   cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the
   digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal,
   especially the allocation of dangerous goods and special cargo. Load
   planners can master complex air cargo load planning through the system
   with optimal solutions generated. The operations of cargo assembly and
   security screening with digital twins could be further developed for
   future development.},

Abstract = {The trend of digitalization has produced rapidly increasing data
   interaction and authentication demand in today's Internet of things
   ecosystem. To face the challenge, we demonstrated a micro-scale label by
   direct laser writing to perform as a passport between the physical and
   digital worlds. On this label, the user information is encrypted into
   three-dimensional geometric structures by a tensor network and then
   authenticated through the decryption system based on computer vision. A
   two-step printing methodology is applied to code the randomly
   distributed fluorescence from doped quantum dots, which achieved
   physical unclonable functions (PUFs) of the passport. The 10(5)
   bits/mm(2) data storage density enables abundant encrypted information
   from physical worlds, for example, the biometric data of human users.
   This passport guarantees the strong correlation between the user's
   privacy data and the PUF-assisted codes, successfully overcoming the
   illegal transfer of authentication information. Due to its ultra-high
   security level and convenience, the printed passport has enormous
   potential in future digital twin authentication anytime anywhere,
   including personal identity, valuable certificates, and car networking.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To ensure food security, agricultural production systems should innovate
   in the direction of increasing production while reducing utilized
   resources. Due to the higher level of automation with respect to
   traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture
   (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at
   the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin
   (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the
   productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource
   consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is
   introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its
   validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize
   productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the
   optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control
   of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management.
   Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the
   authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies
   for improving the productivity of CEA systems.},

Abstract = {In the era of technological transformation, mobility and transportation
   systems are becoming more intelligent and greener. Thanks to powerful
   technologies and tools, electric and autonomous vehicles are spreading
   worldwide, substituting internal combustion engine vehicles and
   revolutionizing the way to drive. In this context, this paper is an
   extended version of the paper ``Digital Twin in Intelligent
   Transportation Systems: a Review published in 2020 7th International
   Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies
   (CoDIT){''}. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review
   of the literature from the last five years on the use of digital twin
   (DT) technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), focusing
   on electric and autonomous vehicles. In particular, with respect to the
   previous work, the focus has been expanded to include DT integration
   with other cutting-edge technologies, such as the Internet of Things
   (IoT), Big Data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML),
   and 5G for ITS. Moreover, this paper presents a broad perspective on
   challenges in EV applications, including tracking, monitoring, battery
   and charge management, connectivity, security, and privacy. In addition,
   this paper discusses how DT can be used to effectively address the
   current issues in electric vehicle services, such as tracking,
   monitoring, battery and charge management, connectivity, security, and
   privacy.},

Title = {A Smart Digital Twin Enabled Security Framework for Vehicle-to-Grid
   Cyber-Physical Systems},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration has led to more
   flexible and reliable vehicle-to-grid-enabled cyber-physical systems
   (V2G-CPSs). However, the increasing system complexity also makes them
   more vulnerable to cyber-physical threats. Coordinated cyber attacks
   (CCAs) have emerged as a major concern, requiring effective detection
   and mitigation strategies within V2G-CPSs. Digital twin (DT)
   technologies have shown promise in mitigating system complexity and
   providing diverse functionalities for complex tasks such as system
   monitoring, analysis, and optimal control. This paper presents a
   resilient and secure framework for CCA detection and mitigation in
   V2G-CPSs, leveraging a smart DT-enabled approach. The framework
   introduces a smarter DT orchestrator that utilizes long short-term
   memory (LSTM) based actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (LSTM-DRL)
   in the DT virtual replica. The LSTM algorithm estimates the system
   states, which are then used by the DRL network to detect CCAs and take
   appropriate actions to minimize their impact. To validate the
   effectiveness and practicality of the proposed smart DT framework, case
   studies are conducted on an IEEE 30 bus system-based V2G-CPS,
   considering different CCA types such as malicious V2G node or control
   command attacks. The results demonstrate that the framework is capable
   of accurately estimating system states, detecting various CCAs, and
   mitigating the impact of attacks within 5 seconds.},

Title = {Reengineering and Its Reliability: An Analysis of Water Projects and
   Watershed Management under a Digital Twin Scheme in China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Water project and watershed management is currently being reengineered
   under digital twin schemes in China through pilot projects. An
   evaluation on pilot reengineering is important for its further
   implementation and improvement. This paper investigates national
   legislation and pilot projects' implementations of a digital twin
   watershed and digital twin water project from the perspectives of
   design, policy, technology, investment, personnel, cyberspace security,
   co-construction, and sharing through interviews and expert review, and
   it uses a Bayesian network to study their reliability. First, the design
   of the digital twin watershed and digital twin water project is
   reasonable with regard to system architecture and business management.
   Second, although there are some national legislations on cyberspace
   security and geospatial data, they are incomplete for policy making and
   are probably infeasible for some technology. Third, there are
   insufficient mechanisms to sustainably support investment, personnel,
   and cyberspace security. Forth, co-construction and sharing are required
   for both inside and outside water departments. Fifth, the Bayesian
   network is useful for investigating the reliability of weak nodes, and
   it is helpful for the design and further implementation of the digital
   twin watershed and digital twin water project, as will be demonstrated
   with an anonymous example. This study could provide useful insights into
   the further reengineering of water projects and watershed management
   under a digital twin scheme in the world.},

Title = {Digital Twin-based Anomaly Detection with Curriculum Learning in
   Cyber-physical Systems},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical
   systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and
   CPS themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more
   challenging. In our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based
   anomaly detection method, called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both
   historical and real-time data of CPS. However, such data vary
   significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore, similar to human
   learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can benefit from
   an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we present
   a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth
   Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing
   curriculum learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE
   attributes each sample with a difficulty score, before being fed into a
   training scheduler. The training scheduler samples batches of training
   data based on these difficulty scores such that learning from easy to
   difficult data can be performed. To evaluate LATTICE, we use five
   publicly available datasets collected from five real-world CPS testbeds.
   We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art anomaly
   detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three
   baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906\%-2.367\% in terms of the F1 score.
   LATTICE also, on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2\%
   on the five datasets and is on par with the baselines in terms of
   detection delay time.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Digital twins are used to replicate the behavior of physical systems,
   and in-vehicle networks can greatly benefit from this technology. This
   is mainly because in-vehicle networks circulate large amounts of data
   coming from various sources such as wired, or in some cases even
   wireless, sensors that are fused by actuators responsible for
   safety-critical tasks that require careful testing. In this work, we
   build a laboratory in-vehicle network that mimics a real vehicle network
   in regards to wire length, number of stubs and devices that are
   connected to it. The Controller Area Network (CAN), which is still the
   most popular communication bus inside cars, is used as a network layer.
   Using models defined in MATLAB for various subsystems, e.g., Anti-lock
   Braking System (ABS), Powertrain and Electric Power-Steering, deployed
   on automotive-grade microcontrollers, we evaluate the in-vehicle bus
   digital twin by providing realistic inputs and recording and reproducing
   in-vehicle network traffic. The experimental results showed good
   correlation between the output of the implemented digital twin and the
   data collected from an actual car.},

Abstract = {Due to the installation of various apparatus in process industries, both
   factors of complex structures and severe operating conditions could
   result in higher accident frequencies and maintenance challenges. Given
   the importance of security in process systems, this paper presents a
   data-driven digital twin system for automatic process applications by
   integrating virtual modeling, process monitoring, diagnosis, and
   optimized control into a cooperative architecture. For unknown model
   parameters, the adaptive system identification is proposed to model
   closed-loop virtual systems and residual signals with fault-free case
   data. Performance indices are improved to make the design of robust
   monitoring and diagnosis system to identify the apparatus status.
   Soft-sensor, parameterization control, and model-matching
   reconfiguration are ameliorated and incorporated into the optimized
   control configuration to guarantee stable and safe control performance
   under apparatus faults. The effectiveness and performance of the
   proposed digital twin system are evaluated by using different
   simulations on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process in the presence
   of realistic fault scenarios. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Digital Twin for Wireless Networks: Security Attacks and Solutions},
Journal = {IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 20},
Abstract = {Emerging applications (e.g., human-computer interaction, digital
   healthcare, and intelligent transportation systems) can be effectively
   enabled using digital twins (DTs) that combine the virtual model of a
   physical system with other technologies/ schemes (i.e., mathematical
   optimization, game theory, and machine learning). Although DTs can well
   enable wireless systems, they will suffer from various security attacks.
   Therefore, this article presents an overview of security attacks and
   concerns in a DT-enabled wireless system. We propose a general framework
   that will serve as guidelines for future DT-enabled wireless systems.
   Additionally, we present two use cases to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed framework. A Stackelberg game-enabled model is provided to
   effectively enable anti-jamming attacks. In addition a residual- enabled
   reweighting aggregation scheme furnishes robust training against flawed
   parameters. Finally, we present an outlook on future directions.},

Abstract = {As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is
   the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and
   provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support
   healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and
   policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience.
   Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience
   in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been
   applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in
   vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code
   context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related
   keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins.
   Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a
   full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience
   check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme
   for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare
   digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture
   bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A
   number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground
   truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and
   non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our
   new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for
   vulnerability detection.},

Abstract = {Future wireless services will focus on improving the quality of life by
   enabling various applications, such as extended reality, brain-computer
   interaction, and healthcare. These applications will have diverse
   performance requirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience
   metrics, latency, and reliability) which will be challenging to be
   fulfilled by existing wireless systems. To meet the diverse requirements
   of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been
   recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along
   with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication
   technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing),
   and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this
   tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for
   wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e.,
   design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital
   twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised
   for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For
   the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of
   twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping,
   deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and
   decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues
   related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air
   interface design are considered. Finally, open research challenges and
   opportunities are discussed.},

   Implementation},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs), with their
   associated communication and control complexities, there is a need for
   an efficient platform that can digest all the incoming data and ensure
   the reliable operation of the power system. The digital twin (DT) is a
   new concept that can unleash tremendous opportunities and can be used at
   the different control and security levels of power systems. This paper
   provides a methodology for the modelling of the implementation of energy
   cyber-physical systems (ECPSs) that can be used for multiple
   applications. Two DT types are introduced to cover the high-bandwidth
   and the low-bandwidth applications that need centric oversight decision
   making. The concept of the digital twin is validated and tested using
   Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud host that can incorporate physical
   and data models as well as being able to receive live measurements from
   the different actual power and control entities. The experimental
   results demonstrate the feasibility of the real-time implementation of
   the DT for the ECPS based on internet of things (IoT) and cloud
   computing technologies. The normalized mean-square error for the
   low-bandwidth DT case was 3.7\%. In the case of a high-bandwidth DT, the
   proposed method showed superior performance in reconstructing the
   voltage estimates, with 98.2\% accuracy from only the controllers'
   states.},

Abstract = {To predict the transportation process of a class of metamorphic object,
   e.g., deformable interlink linear object (DLO), the system particularity
   and coupling complexity is much increased due to external metamorphic
   constraints compared with classic multi-robot manipulation system. To
   explore the coupling effect, a virtual DLO model described by wave PDE
   equations with velocity feedback is proposed for replacing external
   metamorphic constraints. Independent stability controller is designed
   for feedback control of virtual DLO from perspective of MSR considering
   model stabilization. With the integration of proposed virtual DLO model,
   a digital-twin prediction prototype system of metamorphic object
   transportation is established. To bridge the communication gap between
   physical and digital world, a THz communication-based system framework
   is proposed to implement the digital-twin prediction for extremely
   security-sensitive system. Both numeric simulation and industrial
   experiment prove the availability and feasibility.},

Abstract = {The concept of the digital twin has been adopted as an important aspect
   in digital transformation of power systems. Although the notion of the
   digital twin is not new, its adoption into the energy sector has been
   recent and has targeted increased operational efficiency. This paper is
   focused on addressing an important gap in the research literature
   reviewing the state of the art in utilization of digital twin technology
   in microgrids, an important component of power systems. A microgrid is a
   local power network that acts as a dependable island within bigger
   regional and national electricity networks, providing power without
   interruption even when the main grid is down. Microgrids are essential
   components of smart cities that are both resilient and sustainable,
   providing smart cities the opportunity to develop sustainable energy
   delivery systems. Due to the complexity of design, development and
   maintenance of a microgrid, an efficient simulation model with ability
   to handle the complexity and spatio-temporal nature is important. The
   digital twin technologies have the potential to address the
   above-mentioned requirements, providing an exact virtual model of the
   physical entity of the power system. The paper reviews the application
   of digital twins in a microgrid at electrical points where the microgrid
   connects or disconnects from the main distribution grid, that is, points
   of common coupling. Furthermore, potential applications of the digital
   twin in microgrids for better control, security and resilient operation

Abstract = {Relevant research has investigated how predictive modeling algorithms,
   deep-learning-based sensing technologies, and big urban data configure
   immersive hyperconnected virtual spaces in digital twin cities: digital
   twin modeling tools, monitoring and sensing technologies, and
   Internet-of-Things-based decision support systems articulate
   big-data-driven urban geopolitics. This systematic review aims to
   inspect the recently published literature on digital twin simulation
   tools, spatial cognition algorithms, and multi-sensor fusion technology
   in sustainable urban governance networks. We integrate research
   developing on how blockchain-based digital twins, smart infrastructure
   sensors, and real-time Internet of Things data assist urban computing
   technologies. The research problems are whether: data-driven smart
   sustainable urbanism requires visual recognition tools, monitoring and
   sensing technologies, and simulation-based digital twins;
   deep-learning-based sensing technologies, spatial cognition algorithms,
   and environment perception mechanisms configure digital twin cities; and
   digital twin simulation modeling, deep-learning-based sensing
   technologies, and urban data fusion optimize Internet-of-Things-based
   smart city environments. Our analyses particularly prove that virtual
   navigation tools, geospatial mapping technologies, and Internet of
   Things connected sensors enable smart urban governance. Digital twin
   simulation, data visualization tools, and ambient sound recognition
   software configure sustainable urban governance networks. Virtual
   simulation algorithms, deep learning neural network architectures, and
   cyber-physical cognitive systems articulate networked smart cities.
   Throughout January and March 2023, a quantitative literature review was
   carried out across the ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science databases,
   with search terms comprising ``sustainable urban governance networks{''}
   + ``digital twin simulation tools{''}, ``spatial cognition
   algorithms{''}, and ``multi-sensor fusion technology{''}. A Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow
   diagram was generated using a Shiny App. AXIS (Appraisal tool for
   Cross-Sectional Studies), Dedoose, MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool),
   and the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) were used to assess the
   quality of the identified scholarly sources. Dimensions and VOSviewer
   were employed for bibliometric mapping through spatial and data layout
   algorithms. The findings gathered from our analyses clarify that
   Internet-of-Things-based smart city environments integrate 3D virtual

Abstract = {Smart city digital twins can provide useful insights by making effective
   use of multidisciplinary urban data from diverse sources. Whilst these
   insights provide new information that helps cities in decision making,
   verifying the authenticity, integrity, traceability and data ownership
   across various functional units have become critical characteristics to
   ensure the data is from an authentic and trustworthy source. However,
   these characteristics are rarely considered in a digital twin ecosystem.
   In this research we introduce a novel framework, namely, `SIGNED: Smart
   cIty diGital twiN vErifiable Data framework' that is designed on the
   basis of data ownership, selective disclosure and verifiability
   principles. Using Verifiable Credentials, SIGNED ensures digital twin
   data are verifiably authentic i.e., it covers provenance, transparency,
   and reliability through verifiable presentation. A proof of concept is
   designed and evaluated based on a smart water management use case to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of SIGNED in securing verifiable exchange
   of digital twin data across multiple functional units. The
   proof-of-concept demonstrates that SIGNED successfully allows the
   exchange of data in a trusted and verifiable manner at negligible
   performance cost, thus enhancing security and alleviating privacy issues
   when sharing data between various functional units in a smart city.},

Title = {DT-Assisted Multi-Point Symbiotic Security in Space-Air-Ground
   Integrated Networks},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {5721-5734},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission of multi-resource
   heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs) in space-air-ground
   integrated network (SAGIN) from the perspective of physical layer
   security. Considering the network heterogeneity, resource constrain, and
   channel similarity, it is challenging to implement the physical layer
   security in SAGIN. Particularly, digital twin (DT) is considered in the
   cyberspace of SAGIN to reflect the physical network entities (i.e.,
   satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial base station),
   which is assumed to comprehensively control and manage the heterogeneous
   RANs' resources. To ensure secure transmissions of multi-tier
   heterogeneous downlink communications in SAGIN, a multi-point symbiotic
   security scheme is proposed through DT-assisted multi-dimensional domain
   synergy precoding, where the co-channel interference due to spectrum
   sharing among these heterogeneous RANs is recast to unevenly corrupt the
   main and wiretap channels of each legitimate user. Specifically, to
   realize the multi-point symbiotic security, a max-min problem is
   formulated to maximize the minimum secrecy rate of three heterogeneous
   downlinks. Since this problem is non-convex and challenging, a list of
   mathematical reformulations is derived and the successive convex
   approximation (SCA) based multi-dimensional domain synergy precoding
   algorithm is proposed to solve it. Moreover, the computational
   complexity of our proposed approach is analyzed and meaningful
   discussions are made. In addition, extensive simulations are carried out
   to evaluate the secrecy rate performance and verify the efficiency of
   our proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and
   next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid
   development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the
   increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and
   allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains
   a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on
   models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT
   networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In
   this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose
   the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical
   edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a
   blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen
   communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN.
   Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we
   propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin
   empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate
   spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm
   that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication
   efficiency and data security for IoT applications.},

Title = {Improved building facade segmentation through digital twin-enabled
   RandLA-Net with empirical intensity correction model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry can
   benefit from accurate building facade segmentation, which can provide
   valuable insights into building maintenance, urban planning, and
   security efforts. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are
   effective in recognizing building facade components from
   (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds by regis-tering 3D spatial
   coordinates and radiometric information, which reveal the spectral
   property of a scanned surface. Although the radiometric information
   (i.e., intensity feature) can be used for segmentation, its accuracy may
   be reduced by factors such as scanning geometry and external factors
   that affect the object's radiometric information. To address this issue,
   this study proposes a robust and automated method for segmenting
   building facade components using LiDAR point cloud data and an
   empirical-based intensity correction model to ensure proper
   segmentation. The proposed method employs RandLA-Net, a deep learning
   model capable of effectively processing large-scale point cloud data, to
   classify building facade components based on their spatial features
   combined with corrected intensity features. By incorporating the
   proposed method into a digital twin, it is possible to perform accurate
   building facade segmentation and generate valuable insights into the
   building's physical condition, energy efficiency, and aesthetic value in
   real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally
   validated using a school building facade, which demonstrated significant
   improvements in the recognition of facade components and highlighted the
   potential of digital twin-enabled building facade segmentation for the
   AEC industry.},

   Finite Sets Based Approach},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Since the submarine has become the major threat to maritime security,
   there is an urgent need to find a more efficient method of
   anti-submarine warfare (ASW). The digital twin theory is one of the most
   outstanding information technologies, and has been quite popular in
   recent years. The most influential change produced by digital twin is
   the ability to enable real-time dynamic interactions between the
   simulation world and the real world. Digital twin can be regarded as a
   paradigm by means of which selected online measurements are dynamically
   assimilated into the simulation world, with the running simulation model
   guiding the real world adaptively in reverse. By combining digital twin
   theory and random finite sets (RFSs) closely, a new framework of sensor
   control in ASW is proposed. Two key algorithms are proposed for
   supporting the digital twin-based framework. First, the RFS-based
   data-assimilation algorithm is proposed for online assimilating the
   sequence of real-time measurements with detection uncertainty, data
   association uncertainty, noise, and clutters. Second, the computation of
   the reward function by using the results of the proposed
   data-assimilation algorithm is introduced to find the optimal control
   action. The results of three groups of experiments successfully verify
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Title = {Digital twin oriented architecture for secure and QoS aware intelligent
   communications in industrial environments},
Journal = {PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {85},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In modern networking industrial environments, characterized by the
   integration of Operation Technology and Information Technology, there is
   a strong need to ensure both safety and security of operations and
   communications. In this regard, IEC 62443 zones and conduits represent
   powerful high-level abstractions stressing the impor-tance of clearly
   separating machines in relation to safety requirements and of clearly
   defining inter-machine communication security requirements. However,
   their actual implementation is still demanded to human-centric
   error-prone procedures performed by technicians directly on network
   elements, without any integrated plant-wide point of view. To overcome
   these issues, first of all we originally state the need of applying the
   Digital Twin approach to zones and conduits, making easier the
   definition and management of inter-machine security requirements. For
   instance, industrial technicians can specify that communication among
   two zones should always flows through a ciphered conduit with a given
   algorithm and key length, at the cost of increased latency. Secondly, we
   state the need of exploiting an intelligent reasoner to monitor the
   current state of the environment (represented by asset and network
   Digital Twins), actively reconfiguring them in case desired requirements
   are not satisfied. Then, the reasoner allows to enforce requirements
   while also considering the fulfillment of a proper trade-off between
   security and performance, e.g., by reducing the ciphering complexity to
   ensure prompt packet dispatching whenever required. Performance results
   based on our working prototype demonstrate the feasibility and
   efficiency of the proposed solution under stringent requirements typical
   of industrial environments. In particular, in terms of better
   flexibility we proved that our orchestrator is able to create a new
   Digital Twin in less than 2.5 s in a typical edge node with a medium
   load. In addition, proposed routing policies based on our machine
   learning reasoner led to the satisfaction of well-defined low latency
   requirements (250 ms) while avoiding packet dropping.(c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {Digital twin technology is recently in the spotlight because of its
   potential applicability in business and industry. In digital twin
   environments, data generated from physical assets are transmitted to a
   remote server, which performs simulations through digital twins in a
   virtual space. Then, the simulation results can be shared with the data
   owner or other users. However, several challenges exist in the
   application of digital twin technology in the real world. One of the
   main challenges involves determining how to share real-time data for the
   simulation and how to share the simulation data securely. The data
   generated from physical assets may include sensitive information from
   data owners, and the leakage of data to an adversary can cause serious
   privacy problems. Moreover, the sharing of data with other data users
   should also be considered to maximize the availability of digital twin
   data. To resolve these issues, we propose a system model for the secure
   sharing of digital twin data. The proposed system model uses cloud
   computing for efficient data sharing and blockchain for data
   verifiability. We also propose communication schemes for the proposed
   model to guarantee privacy preservation and data security in wireless
   channels. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol using
   informal methods and formal methods such as BAN logic and the AVISPA
   simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare the proposed protocol with
   related protocols and demonstrate that the proposed scheme is applicable
   to digital twin environments.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G)
   mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence
   in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin
   and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust
   instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy,
   federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for
   deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks.
   However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack
   of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated
   learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin
   wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless
   networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the
   edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning
   framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which
   improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data
   privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the
   proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge
   association by jointly considering digital twin association, training
   data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent
   reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem.
   Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme
   yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark
   learning methods.},

Title = {Prototyping a Digital Twin for Real Time Remote Control Over Mobile
   Networks: Application of Remote Surgery},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {20325-20336},
Abstract = {The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of
   future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry
   4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface
   description related to a product or process available through a single
   interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment.
   However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future
   application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for
   specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We
   developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of
   communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks
   supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high
   levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject
   for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised
   of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over
   a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the
   system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a
   network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and
   attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization
   within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is
   limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from
   the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could
   be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for
   communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies
   that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we
   concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development
   in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own
   tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a
   potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and
   similar concepts.},

Abstract = {Identifying the locations of cyber attacks in power distribution systems
   is critical to take immediate and effective mitigation actions. This
   article introduces a novel real-time attack localization strategy for
   power distribution systems utilizing a Digital Twin (DT) as a
   cyber-physical real-time reference model that mimics the cyber-physical
   dynamic characteristics of the actual system. The proposed approach
   takes advantage of the DT-based reference model as well as the physical
   characteristics of the radial distribution network to compute a new
   metric, namely Residual Rate of Change (RRC), which allows
   differentiating False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on load measurements
   and protective devices. The RRC enables the determination of the
   attack's location by constructing a directed graph that characterizes
   the physical dependencies of protective devices. The proposed attack
   localization method is implemented on a testbed consisting of a digital
   real-time simulator, feeder protection devices, a real-time automation
   controller, and advanced communication infrastructure for a power
   distribution system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the
   capability of the proposed method to localize cyber attacks in various
   operation scenarios of the power distribution system. The results also
   illustrate that the introduced method outperforms a learning-based
   strategy in localizing different types of attacks in the test system.},

Abstract = {Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as haptics,
   human-computer interaction, and extended reality, using the
   sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems have diverse requirements in
   terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance
   metrics. Therefore, enabling IoE applications over 6G requires a new
   framework that can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the 6G
   wireless system and its underlying IoE services. Such a new framework
   for 6G can be based on digital twins. Digital twins use a virtual
   representation of the 6G physical system along with the associated
   algorithms (e.g., machine learning, optimization), communication
   technologies (e.g., millimeter-wave and terahertz communication),
   computing systems (e.g., edge computing and cloud computing), as well as
   privacy and security-related technologists (e.g., blockchain). First, we
   present the key design requirements for enabling 6G through the use of a
   digital twin. Next, the architectural components and trends such as
   edge-based twins, cloud-based-twins, and edge-cloud-based twins are
   presented. Furthermore, we provide a comparative description of various
   twins. Finally, we outline and recommend guidelines for several future

Title = {ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {107574-107588},
Abstract = {The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern
   regarding the development of security monitoring and management
   mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in
   ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not
   easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the
   natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions
   implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical
   objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security
   analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed
   in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises
   deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return
   will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support
   infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data
   collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the
   acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to
   design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures,
   developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are
   built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic
   Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection
   processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning
   models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The
   validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of
   the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using
   cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the
   projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go
   OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS
   (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate
   that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins
   have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and
   Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of
   data are generated.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) constructs virtual counterparts of physical devices to
   monitor and optimize their life cycle processes. With the emergence of
   industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has became the
   backbone of the DT by providing a fundamental way to transform physical
   devices to their virtual counterparts. With the deployment of IIoT,
   built-in sensors enable real-time collection of critical DT data
   involving various physical parameters associated with devices during
   their life cycle. However, traditional data sharing services rely on a
   centralized infrastructure, which inevitably brings severe security
   threats to share large volume of sensitive DT data derived from numerous
   sensors. To address the above issue, this paper presents a blockchain
   based Multi-users Oblivious Data Sharing scheme (MODS) for the digital
   twin system in the context of IIoT. MODS supports a broad range of
   security properties including confidentiality, obliviousness, and access
   control for the DT data stored on the blockchain. MODS adopts a hybrid
   design approach by combing trusted hardware and cryptography to achieve
   well balances between security and efficiency. To demonstrate the design
   advantages of MODS, we explore the design space of a multi-users
   oblivious data sharing scheme by using pure cryptographic approach,
   which incurs several design tradeoffs that must be addressed. We show
   that MODS performs well in these tradeoffs. A comprehensive evaluation
   has been conducted to demonstrate that MODS is practical to support
   secure data sharing via blockchain for IIoT.},

   digital twin empowered aerospace industry},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ensuring privacy and security in the aerospace industry's digital twin
   (DT) applications is of utmost importance, particularly when sensitive
   data collected by aerospace assets is shared with remote servers for
   simulation purposes. Moreover, protecting the security of DT data
   retrieved from cloud servers in response to data user requests presents
   a significant challenge. Existing literature proposes various
   authentication schemes; however, their high communication and
   computation overhead make them impractical for providing efficient
   security. To address these concerns, we introduce BPDATA (an improved
   version of Son et al.'s and Thakur et al.'s scheme), a secure
   authentication scheme for cloud-based DT platforms, leveraging
   blockchain technology to preserve privacy. BPDATA facilitates the secure
   sharing of sensitive data through cloud computing while ensuring data
   verifiability and integrity through blockchain integration. We use BAN
   logic and informal security analysis to demonstrate BPDATA's resilience
   against discrete attacks, outperforming contemporary schemes with lower
   computation and communication costs. Compared to the scheme proposed by
   Son et al., BPADTA demonstrated superior performance in terms of
   computation cost, requiring only 178.297 ms, and communication cost,
   amounting to 5184 bits. Additionally, BPADTA effectively countered
   attacks targeting stolen smart devices, anonymity, and untraceability.
   Furthermore, we employ Raspberry Pi to evaluate the performance of
   BPDATA, validating its efficiency and suitability for real-world
   implementation in the aerospace industry.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology is being applied increasingly in the
   Internet of Vehicles environment, but it still faces many challenges in
   terms of efficiency and security. In the field of DT-based autonomous
   driving, many previous works have been done to study the efficient
   migration methods of DT models. But these works consider the migration
   process as a blackbox. We study the efficient migration method of the DT
   model between the edge computing nodes inside the blackbox. We propose
   three different migration strategies depending on the source of the
   initial data and the source of the updated data, and evaluate the
   efficiency of these strategies in terms of migration time in different
   network environments using the autonomous driving simulation platform
   CARLA. We then derive methods for selecting migration strategies under
   different network conditions. During the migration process, there may be
   external attacks on participating elements or networks. We analyze the
   security problems that may arise during the migration process and
   propose corresponding defense methods against such cyberattacks.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) provides accurate guidance for multidimensional

   SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the
   learning performance of deep Q-learning. SAINT supports access priority

Abstract = {Urban digital twin (UDT) technology can be used to digitize physical
   urban spaces. Previous UDT or smart city research reconstructed the
   three-dimensional topography of urban spaces, buildings, and facilities.
   They collected various multimodal sensor data from cities and monitored
   conditions such as temperature, humidity, fine dust, and real-time road
   traffic. However, these studies lacked ways to manage individual
   mobility data, such as those of the vehicles and pedestrians, which
   constitute major components of a city. Here, we propose a geospatial
   platform based on the universal game engine Unity3D, which manages
   large-scale individual mobility data for a UDT platform. The proposed
   platform stores and manages individual vehicles or pedestrians using
   information from public closed-circuit television. It also allows the
   generation of long-term route information for a unique vehicle based on
   its license plate. We also propose methods to anonymize license plates,
   to ensure the security of individuals, and to compress individual
   mobility data. Unique UDT models with individual mobility
   functionalities can be built and visualized using our proposed
   geospatial platform.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},

Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Since the development of smart healthcare services, different solutions
   have been developed in the field of healthcare to increase the life
   expectancy of the patient by reducing the cost of healthcare. Digital
   Twin (DT) is considered one of the most promising technologies and a
   game changer in the field of healthcare. DT is generating a virtual
   imitation of a physical object that mimics the status of an event by
   changing the information in real time. In this article, a smart
   context-aware physical activity monitoring framework is developed by
   combining different advanced techniques such as IoT, DT, FoT, CoT, and
   Blockchain to maintain the sensitiveness of the healthcare domain. In
   the proposed study, the physical movements of an elder are analyzed by
   utilizing the sequential data processing capability of deep learning to
   detect irregular physical events. In addition, the proposed framework
   can keep the data of an individual secured by applying progressed
   security highlights of blockchain. The proposed solution effectively
   analyzed an irregular event of an individual with considerable accuracy
   in real time. The calculated outcomes have shown the effectiveness of DT
   with smart healthcare solutions that would help to develop effective
   medical services by bringing patients and medical care experts together.
   Furthermore, the performance of the proposed solution is measured with
   respect to irregular event recognition, model training and testing, rate
   of latency, and data processing cost. In this manner, a case study
   defines the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the smart
   healthcare industry.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, to deal with the heterogeneity in federated learning (FL)
   systems, a knowledge distil-lation (KD) driven training framework for FL
   is pro-posed, where each user can select its neural network model on
   demand and distill knowledge from a big teacher model using its own
   private dataset. To over-come the challenge of train the big teacher
   model in resource limited user devices, the digital twin (DT) is exploit
   in the way that the teacher model can be trained at DT located in the
   server with enough computing re-sources. Then, during model
   distillation, each user can update the parameters of its model at either
   the phys-ical entity or the digital agent. The joint problem of model
   selection and training offloading and resource allocation for users is
   formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To solve the
   problem, Q-learning and optimization are jointly used, where Q-learning
   selects models for users and determines whether to train locally or on
   the server, and optimiza-tion is used to allocate resources for users
   based on the output of Q-learning. Simulation results show the proposed
   DT-assisted KD framework and joint opti-mization method can
   significantly improve the average accuracy of users while reducing the

Abstract = {The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires
   industrial production towards digitalization to improve network
   efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the
   digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical
   objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very
   challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and
   resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be
   efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy
   consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article,
   we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network
   topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we
   formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation
   problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated
   problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov
   optimization technique to transform the original problem into a
   deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous
   actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation
   offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed
   scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, emerging sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, the Internet
   of Things (IoT), and mobile-edge computing (MEC) technologies have
   played significant roles in developing a sustainable computing network.
   In sustainable computing networks, with the increasing scale of
   data-driven applications, massive privacy-sensitive data are generated.
   How to effectively process such data on resource-limited IoT devices is
   challenging. Although edge intelligence (EI) is designed to maintain an
   appropriate level of ultradelay reliability, low-latency communication
   (URLLC), real-time data processing, and security and privacy are
   concerning. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-supported
   hierarchical digital twin IoT (HDTIoT) framework, which combines the
   digital twin to edge network and adopts blockchain technology to achieve
   secure and reliable real-time computation. We first propose a data and
   knowledge dual-driven learning solution to ensure real-time interaction
   and efficient optimization between the physical and the digital worlds.
   To improve communication and computation efficiency with data and
   knowledge dual-driven learning, the optimization goal is to minimize the
   system delay and energy consumption and ensure system reliability and
   the learning accuracy of IoT devices. Moreover, we propose a proximal
   policy optimization (PPO)-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)
   algorithm to solve the resource allocation (RA) problem. Experimental
   results show that the proposed RA scheme can improve the efficiency of
   the HDTIoT system, guarantee learning accuracy, reliability, and
   security, and make a balance between system delay and energy
   consumption.},

Title = {Atikokan Digital Twin, Part B: Bayesian decision theory for process
   optimization in a biomass energy system},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {334},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {We describe the integration of Bayesian decision theory in a digital
   twin framework to provide a process optimization tool for a biomass
   boiler. Our application is the Atikokan Generating Station, a 200 MW,
   biomass-fired tower boiler operated by Ontario Power Generation in
   Ontario, Canada. For this analysis, we use all available prior
   information as well as data from the biomass plant and from
   science-based models. Our objective is to determine a single-valued
   operational setpoint for the boiler that satisfies a set of
   objectives/constraints while accounting for uncertainty in boiler
   operations and in boiler measurements. This setpoint is then
   continuously updated at the frequency required by plant operations to
   provide dynamic control. This process of decision-making under
   uncertainty is a form of artificial intelligence and provides a formal
   methodology for making optimized decisions in complex systems. Our
   methodology consists of defining the decision space where all possible
   solutions reside, identifying the probability of outcomes given that a
   specific decision was made, creating a decision/cost model that relates
   the quantities of interest (QOIs) in the physical system (e.g. gross
   power output) to the decision QOIs (e.g. dollars), identifying the
   utility (the value to the user) of each outcome, and maximizing the
   expected utility (i.e. the decision). Once the decision (operational
   setpoint) is computed, we can predict all of the QOIs (boiler
   efficiency, O2 concentration at the outlet, etc.) at the decision point
   from the science-based model using the parameter distributions computed
   as part of the Atikokan Digital Twin.},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {As digital transformation progresses across industries, digital twins
   have emerged as an important technology. In healthcare, digital twins
   are created by digitizing patient parameters, medical records, and
   treatment plans to enable personalized care, assist diagnosis, and
   improve planning. Data is core to digital twins, originating from
   physical and virtual entities as well as services. Once processed and
   integrated, data drives various components. Medical records are critical
   healthcare data but present unique challenges for digital twins.
   However, directly storing or encrypting medical records has issues.
   Plaintext risks privacy leaks while encryption hinders retrieval. To
   address this, we present a cloud-based solution combining post-quantum
   searchable encryption. Our system includes key generation using Physical
   Unable Functions (PUF). It encrypts medical records in cloud storage,
   verifies records using blockchain, and retrieves records via cloud. By
   integrating cloud encryption, blockchain verification and cloud
   retrieval, we propose a secure and efficient cloud-based medical records
   system for digital twins. Our implementation demonstrates the system
   provides users efficient and secure medical record services, compared to
   related designs. This highlights digital twins' potential to transform
   healthcare through secure data-driven personalized care, diagnosis and

   Construction Industry: A PRISMA Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Construction 4.0 is witnessing exponential growth in digital twin (DT)
   technology developments and applications, revolutionizing the adoption
   of building information modelling (BIM) and other emerging technologies
   used throughout the built environment lifecycle. BIM provides
   technologies, procedures, and data schemas representing building
   components and systems. At the same time, the DT enhances this with
   real-time data for integrating cyber-physical systems, enabling live
   asset monitoring and better decision making. Despite being in the early
   stages of development, DT applications have rapidly progressed in the
   AEC sector, resulting in a diverse literature landscape due to the
   various technologies and parameters involved in fully developing the DT
   technology. The intricate complexities inherent in digital twin
   advancements have confused professionals and researchers. This confusion
   arises from the nuanced distinctions between the two technologies, i.e.,
   BIM and DT, causing a convergence that hinders realizing their
   potential. To address this confusion and lead to a swift development of
   DT technology, this study provides a holistic review of the existing
   research focusing on the critical components responsible for developing
   the applications of DT technology in the construction industry. It
   highlights five crucial elements: technologies, maturity levels, data
   layers, enablers, and functionalities. Additionally, it identifies
   research gaps and proposes future avenues for streamlined DT
   developments and applications in the AEC sector. Future researchers and
   practitioners can target data integrity, integration and transmission,
   bi-directional interoperability, non-technical factors, and data
   security to achieve mature digital twin applications for AEC practices.
   This study highlights the growing significance of DTs in construction
   and provides a foundation for further advancements in this field to
   harness its potential to transform built environment practices. It also
   pinpoints the latest developments in AI, namely the large language model
   (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)'s implications for DT
   education, policies, and the construction industry's practices.},

Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {649},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Internet of Vehicle (IoV) is an emerging technology for the
   development of future smart cities. With the fast and exponential
   growing rate of Internet of Things (IoT), the smart trans-portation
   field is ushering in a revolutionary advancement. Smart transportation
   systems facili-tate better informed, more coordinated, and smarter use
   of transport networks, with the use of advanced information and
   communication technologies applied to vehicles to help improve traffic
   management, minimize congestion, improve safety, and ultimately provide
   a more intel-ligent use of transport networks. Smart transportation is
   an integral part of modern-day smart city projects. However, the world
   climate institution has reported that carbon emissions from the overall
   transportation system accounts for one-fifth of global carbon dioxide
   with a sum of around 24\% of energy. Electric vehicles (EV) represent a
   solution for this issue, yet, it is not sustainable. The communication
   between EVs and a roadside unit (RSU), and the continuous computational
   power required to support an IoV system also requires a reliance on
   energy harvesting. With this in mind, in this paper, we propose a
   decentralized trust management solution for IoV systems to reduce both
   carbon footprint and offload the computation power required. Our
   solution resides in developing the digital twin of vehicles on an
   intelligent edge environment to simulate the physical vehicle and handle
   the required data processing. Also, we implement a smart contract model
   for fast, secure, and sustainable on-road battery recharging between
   EVs.},

Abstract = {With the continuous integration of information technology and operation
   technology, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gradually
   changing from closed to open. Operators can configure, monitor, or
   control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which
   brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the
   availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study
   security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an
   IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and
   defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional
   IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are
   not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber-attacks. To solve these
   problems, in this article, we propose a framework for a digital
   twin-based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with
   multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and
   convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is
   reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature
   changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the
   ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce
   production processes and replace field devices.},

Title = {IoT-based digital twin best practices for reducing operational carbon in
   building retrofitting: a mixed-method approach},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 11},
Abstract = {Purpose The Internet of Things-based digital twin (IoT-DT) technologies
   offer a transformative approach to building retrofitting for reducing
   operational carbon (ROC) emissions. However, a notable gap exists
   between the potential and adoption of the two emerging technologies,
   further exacerbated by the nascent state of research in this domain.
   This research aims to establish the best practices that innovatively
   strengthen the identified enablers to decisively tackle challenges,
   ensuring the efficient implementation of IoT-DT for ROC emissions in
   buildings.Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a mixed-method
   approach. Questionnaire data from 220 multidiscipline professionals were
   analysed via structural equation modelling analysis, while interview
   data obtained from 18 stakeholders were analysed using thematic content
   analysis. The findings were triangulated for cohesive
   interpretation.Findings After the analysis of questionnaire data, a
   structural model was established, depicting the critical challenges
   (inadequate data security, limited technical expertise and scalability
   issues) and key enablers (robust data security measures, skill
   development and government incentives) of implementing IoT-DT for ROC.
   Sequentially, analysis of in-depth interview data revealed the IoT-based
   DT best practices (safeguarding data, upskilling and incentivization).
   Upon triangulating the questionnaire and interview findings, this study
   explicitly highlights the potential of the established best practices to
   strategically strengthen enablers, thereby mitigating challenges and
   ensuring the successful implementation of IoT-based DT for ROC emissions
   in buildings.Originality/value This study provides practical guidance
   for stakeholders to effectively implement IoT-DT in ROC in buildings and
   contributes significantly to climate change mitigation.},

Abstract = {Mobile edge computing is one of the key enabling technologies of smart
   industry solutions, providing agile and ubiquitous services for mobile
   devices (MDs) through offloading latency-critical tasks to edge service
   providers. However, it is challenging to make optimal decisions of
   computation offloading and resource allocation while ensuring the
   privacy and information security of MDs. Consequently, we consider a new
   vision of digital twin (DT) empowered edge networks, where the
   optimization problem is formulated as a two-stage incentive mechanism.
   First, the resource allocation strategy is determined by the interaction
   among DTs according to the credit-based incentives. Afterward, a
   distributed incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg-based
   alternating direction method of multipliers is opted to obtain the
   optimal offloading and privacy investment strategies in parallel.
   Numerical results show that the proposed two-stage incentive mechanism
   achieves effective resource allocation and computation offloading while
   simultaneously improving the privacy and information security of MDs.},

Abstract = {The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object,
   which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The
   DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle
   that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a
   production system and its components. A methodology design using
   model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being
   both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels:
   first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide
   basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication,
   security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and
   simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical
   composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on
   these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed
   using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that
   supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A
   case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated
   with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are
   described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify
   that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment
   process of a DT.},

Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {642},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The public has regarded Edge-AI enabled Industrial Internet of Things
   (IIoT) as the crucial foundation in the intelligent digital factories in
   Industry 4.0. It can fully catch the massive production data derived
   from the complex production process, and provide efficient, intelligent
   services. However, the deployment of edge AI aggravates the complexity
   and security risks caused by the massive heterogeneous
   resource-constrained and vulnerable edge IIoT devices. Effective fault
   prevention is crucial to ensure the security and robustness of the IIoT
   with numerous vulnerable edge devices. Most existing solutions are based
   on the history log, which can hardly defend against attacks and is easy
   to cause excessive maintenance. To address this issue, we propose a
   trustworthy self-healing scheme based on the combination of distributed
   digital twin (DT) and blockchain, to ensure the security and robustness
   of the industrial system network. We first propose an implementation
   architecture of the distributed DT based self-healing IIoT to apply the
   distributed DT simulation capability fully. In addition, we provide a DT
   simulation operating mechanism for the controlled industrial devices,
   considering the requirement of users and constrained resources of edge
   servers. Moreover, this work proposes a blockchain-based decentralized
   trust management mechanism to ensure the reliability of self-healing.
   The security analysis and performance evaluation show the security and
   efficiency of our proposal.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is a key enabling technology to realize cyber-physical
   system (CPS), which can truly perceive, map, and predict the operating
   state of physical entity. Through analyzing the generality of the
   testing process of large and complex equipment components (LCEC), a
   five-dimensional framework of DT-based test process management (DTTPM)
   is proposed, which comprises physical layer, network layer, data layer,
   model layer, and service layer. In order to realize the visualization
   and enhance the controllability, security, and information transparency
   of LCEC in the testing process, three key technologies are elaborated in
   detail as follows: (1) the construction of the twin semantic model of
   the testing process in model layer, (2) the synchronization method of
   twin model and physical entity based on real-time data, (3) and
   human-computer interaction-based visual monitoring of authenticity and
   safety coordination. Through the case of the vibration test for the
   crowned blade of a steam turbine by blade tip-timing measurement, the
   feasibility and flexibility of DTTPM are demonstrated.},

Title = {Data-driven hybrid petri-net based energy consumption behaviour
   modelling for digital twin of energy-efficient manufacturing system},
Journal = {ENERGY},

Abstract = {Advances in energy-saving technology is main way to achieve carbon
   neutrality. With the development of digital twin, building the
   physical-virtual data space for improving energy management capacity of
   enterprises has received tremendous attention. The energy behaviour
   model implementing accurate simulation and prediction of energy state is
   the core meta-model of energy-efficient manufacturing digital twin
   (EMDT). The widely used state-based energy modelling assumes constant
   power in operation state and approximately fits the energy behaviour
   without considering uncertain operation environment, resulting in energy
   behaviour distortion. A data-driven hybrid petri-net (DDHPN) inspired by
   both the state-based energy modelling and machine learning was developed
   for establishing the energy behaviour meta-model. Gaussian kernel
   extreme learning machine is proposed to fit the instantaneous firing
   speed of energy consumption continuous transitions in DDHPN. DDHPN-based
   energy behaviour model is driven by physical data under real-time
   working conditions, operating parameters, and production load for
   generating a virtual data space of energy management. Finally, DDHPN was
   integrated into the EMDT model using unified modelling language. The
   application in extrusion process and die casting process show that the
   presented model has higher accuracy in energy behaviour prediction.
   Furthermore, a digital-twin-based energy management prototype system for
   extrusion workshop demonstrates its potential. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
   necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to
   increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with
   IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve
   data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a
   massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers
   for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication
   channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various
   types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated
   from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep
   Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data
   processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a
   new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to
   simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we
   propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart
   contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL
   scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against
   valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term
   Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the
   spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are
   further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based
   Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn
   long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical
   implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement
   of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network.},

Abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has empowered the Industrial Internet of Things
   (IIoT) in many ways, such as vehicle-aided traffic flow scheduling,
   drone-aided visual inspections, etc. However, dynamic perception and
   cooperative decision making among these heterogeneous and
   resource-constrained mobile clients in IIoT remains a big challenge. In
   this article, we propose an incentive-based federated learning scheme
   for digital twin (DT)-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing.
   Specifically, we first design a DT-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing
   architecture to achieve dynamic perception of the complex IIoT
   environment, among heterogeneous and resource-constrained mobile
   clients. Second, we develop a novel incentive-based federated learning
   framework incorporated with a contract-based reputation mechanism and a
   Stackelberg-based interclient incentive mechanism, to optimize the model
   accuracy. Third, we devise a knowledge distillation algorithm for the
   federated learning framework, to address the heterogeneity of
   nonindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Extensive
   experiments on both MNIST/FEMNIST and CIFAR10/100 data sets demonstrate
   the outperformance of our proposed scheme, in terms of model accuracy,
   incentive fairness, and data compatibility, compared to state-of-the-art
   studies.},

Abstract = {To meet the future demands for ubiquitous communication coverage and
   temporary / unexpected computing resources, aerial computing networks
   have been envisioned as a new paradigm. Nevertheless, dynamic changes on
   the network make it particularly challenging to achieve global optimal
   resource allocation. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) can
   represent real objects in physical network by creating virtual models.
   With the help of DT, we can easily obtain comprehensive real-world
   high-fidelity state information for model training, so as to achieve
   intelligent efficient decision-making. Accordingly, DT-based aerial
   computing networks have emerged as a potential solution. Note that
   available researches mostly assumed simple ground user distribution like
   uniform distribution, and adopted binary / partial offloading in task
   processing, neglecting the task separability and data inter-dependency
   among subtasks. Toward this end, we introduce DT into aerial computing
   networks, and study the problem of intelligent UAV deployment and
   resource allocation. Specifically, we firstly propose a DT-assisted UAV
   deployment strategy and model the data inter-dependency among subtasks.
   After that, two DT-assisted hybrid (binary and partial) task offloading
   schemes are presented, i.e., heuristic greedy and DQN-based schemes.
   Extensive analysis and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of
   our proposed DT-assisted UAV deployment and hybrid task offloading
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The increased rate of cyber-attacks on the power system necessitates the
   need for innovative solutions to ensure its resiliency. This work builds
   on the advancement in the IoT to provide a practical framework that is
   able to respond to multiple attacks on a network of interconnected

   cyber-physical system that interacts with the control system to ensure
   its proper operation. The IoT cloud provision of the energy
   cyber-physical and the DT are mathematically formulated. Unlike other
   cybersecurity frameworks in the literature, the proposed one can
   mitigate an individual as well as coordinated attacks. The framework is
   tested on a distributed control system and the security measures are
   implemented using cloud computing. The physical controllers are
   implemented using single-board computers. The practical results show
   that the proposed DT is able to mitigate the coordinated false data

Journal = {TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES},

Abstract = {Currently, the automotive industry has entered a period of considerable
   advancement, shifting towards the development of safe, comfortable, and
   connected autonomous vehicles. However, the need for real-time sensing,
   computation, and communication may lead to information overflow in
   autonomous cars, resulting in data redundancy. Furthermore, anticipating
   traffic conditions beyond a vehicle's field of view can be quite
   difficult owing to the restricted range of communication systems. To
   solve these problems, digital twin systems have been developed for
   autonomous driving environments. Because autonomous vehicles are driven
   on open public road networks, this function may jeopardize vehicles,
   user-identifying information, and sensitive data. Hence, an
   authentication scheme that can be deployed in digital-twin-enabled
   autonomous vehicle environments is needed. In this study, we propose a
   privacy-preserving authentication mechanism. To establish the security
   of the proposed method, we performed a formal security analysis based on
   the real-or-random model. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of
   the proposed scheme, and our results demonstrate that it can reduce
   calculation and transmission costs.},

Title = {Digital twin-driven SDN for smart grid: A deep learning integrated
   blockchain for cybersecurity},
Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {263},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Smart Grid (SG) network is envisioned
   as the next-generation network for intelligent and efficient electric
   power transmission. In SG environment, the Smart Meters (SMs) mostly
   exchange services and data from Service Providers (SPs) via insecure
   public channel. This makes the entire SG ecosystem vulnerable to various
   security threats. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we
   incorporate Digital Twin (DT) technology, Software-Defined Networking
   (SDN), Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain into the design of a novel SG
   network. Specifically, a secure communication channel is first designed
   using an authentication method based on blockchain technology that has
   the ability to withstand a number of well-known assaults. Second, a new
   DL architecture that includes a self-attention mechanism, a
   BidirectionalGated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, fully connected
   layers, and a softmax classifier is designed to enhance the attack
   detection process in SG environments. To deliver low latency and
   real-time services, the SDN is next employed as the network's backbone
   to send requests from SMs to a global SDN controller. DT technology is
   finally integrated into the SDN control plane, which stores the
   operating states and behavior models of SMs and communicates with SMs.
   The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the
   blockchain implementation used in the SG network to assess computing
   time for the various numbers of transactions per block. Finally, the
   numerical results based on the N-BaIoT dataset shows better intrusion
   detection.},

Title = {CKAA: Certificateless key-agreement authentication scheme in digital
   twin telemedicine environment},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 27},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology provides accurate and real-time
   visualization data. It is increasingly used in telemedicine to enhance
   medical efficiency and improve the precision of remote diagnosis and
   treatment. In telemedicine, DT is used to collect patients' biomedical
   data and transmit it to cloud servers through wearable devices for
   simulation, enabling remote diagnosis and treatment. However,
   telemedicine poses security threats due to the risk of medical data
   leaks. The security of medical data in transit and the authentication of
   communication entities are two key issues in cryptography. To address
   these issue, we propose a certificateless key agreement authentication
   scheme that does not rely on traditional public key infrastructure and
   certificate management, reducing the storage cost of resource-limited
   wearable devices and avoiding the use of bilinear pairings to lower
   computational costs. Our scheme includes two parts of key agreement: one
   between the patient and the cloud server and the other between the
   patient and the hospital. Through these key agreements, we can ensure
   the privacy and integrity of medical data during transmission.
   Furthermore, we prove that the security of our scheme is equivalent to
   the elliptic curve discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle
   model. Therefore, we provide a secure and efficient certificateless key
   agreement authentication solution that is suitable in digital twin
   telemedicine environments, particularly for client devices with limited
   functionality.
   Digital twin technology in telemedicine improves medical efficiency and
   remote diagnosis. This article addresses security challenges by
   proposing a certificateless key agreement authentication scheme,
   ensuring secure data transmission while reducing storage and
   computational costs for wearable devices in digital twin
   telemedicine.image},

Abstract = {Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into vehicular networks have
   shown high potentials in affording intensive computing tasks. In this
   paper, we study the digital twin driven vehicular edge computing
   networks for adaptively computing resource management where an unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) named FlexEdge acts as a flying server. In
   particular, we first formulate an energy consumption minimization
   problem by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory and computation resource
   under the practical constraints. To address such a challenging problem,
   we then build the computation offloading process as a Markov decision
   process and propose a deep reinforcement learning-based proximal policy
   optimization algorithm to dynamically learn the computation offloading
   strategy and trajectory design policy. Numerical results indicate that
   our proposed algorithm can achieve quick convergence rate and
   significantly reduce the system energy consumption.},

Abstract = {With recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT),
   the bleeding edge concept of digital twin (DT) has enticed the attention
   of many researchers to revolutionize the entire modern industries. DT
   concept refers to a digital representation of a physical entity that is
   able to reflect its physical behavior by applying platforms and
   bidirectional interaction of data in real-time. The remarkable
   deployment of the internet of things in the power grid has led to
   reliable access to information that improves its performance and equips
   it with a powerful tool for real-time data management and analysis. This
   paper aims to trace the continuous investigation and propose practical
   ideas in originating and developing DT technology, according to various
   application domains of power systems, and also describes the proposed
   solutions to deal with the challenges associated with DT. Indeed, with
   the development of modern cities, different energy layers such as
   transportation systems, smart grids, and microgrids have emerged facing
   various issues that challenge the multi-dimensional energy management
   system. For example, in transportation systems, traffic is a major
   problem that requires real-time management, planning, and analysis. In
   power grids, remote data transfer within the grid and also various
   analyzes needing real data are just some of the current challenges in
   the field. These problems can be cracked by providing and analyzing a
   real twin framework in each section. All in all, this paper aims to
   survey different applications of DT in the development of the various
   aspects of energy management within a city including transportation
   systems, power grids, and microgrids. Besides, the security of DT
   technology based on ML is discussed. It also provides a complete view
   for the readers to be able to develop and deploy a DT technology for
   various power system applications.},

Abstract = {In recent years, industrial control systems have evolved toward
   stability and efficiency, increasing industrial control systems
   interconnected with the Internet, which means that industrial control
   systems are facing more serious cyber threats. Thus, it is critical for
   enterprises to consider issues related to data privacy and network
   security. Digital twin enables real-time synchronization and simulation
   of data from various physical components of industrial control systems.
   However, anomaly detection of twin data is still challenging because
   existing methods are usually multi-stage with tedious training and
   detection steps. Therefore, we propose a method called end-to-end
   anomaly detection with the aim to accomplish real-time anomaly detection
   quickly and accurately. In order to seek key features, multidimensional
   deconvolutional network and attention mechanism are applied to our
   model. The results of this study indicate that our method performs well
   on precision and F1 score in comparison to the state-of-art methods.},

Abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Healthcare Things (IIoHT) is the emerging
   paradigm in digital healthcare. Context-aware healthcare sensors, local
   intelligent watches, healthcare devices, wireless communication
   technologies, fog, and cloud computing are all parts of the IIoHT used
   in healthcare. The ubiquitous healthcare services it provides to its
   users in practice. However, the current IIoHT healthcare frameworks have
   security and failure issues in mobile fog and cloud networks where they
   are spread out. This paper presents the secure, fault-tolerant IIoHT
   Framework based on digital twin (DT) federated learning-enabled
   fog-cloud models. The DT is an effective technology that makes virtual
   copies of servers at different locations. DT integrated with federated
   learning inside the fog and cloud environments, where the failure of
   tasks and execution improved for healthcare sensor data. The study aims
   to reduce processing time and the risk of task failure. The study
   presents the Secure and Fault-Tolerant Strategies (SFTS)-enabled IIoHT
   framework that optimizes wearable sensor data and executes it with the
   minimum offloading and processing delays. Simulation results show that
   the proposed work minimized the security risk by 40\%, failure risk of
   tasks risk by 50\%, and the training and testing time by 39\% for sensor
   data during the execution of mobile fog cloud networks. (c) 2023 The

Title = {ENIGMA: An explainable digital twin security solution for cyber-physical
   systems},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {151},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical
   counterparts, share valuable knowledge of the underlying physical
   processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to
   Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing
   operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the
   operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a
   potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for
   attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security
   loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a
   gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while
   providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual
   training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
   (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security
   orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However,
   AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack
   of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in
   the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security
   challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called
   sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While
   leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming
   scenarios to assess DTs' security and train security analysts. The game
   players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the
   defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI
   (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions
   made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the
   defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the
   contribution of different features towards predicting the outcome of
   attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take
   security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally,
   experimental validation has been carried out to demonstrate the
   viability of ENIGMA.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The comprehensive effect of multiple factors that include the geometric
   characteristics, load status, service characteristics, and failure
   mechanism will affect the safety of bridge crane structure. To evaluate
   the security of the bridge crane structure, the real-time prediction
   method of fatigue life of the bridge structure based on digital twin is
   proposed. The specific type of general bridge crane is selected as the
   physical entity of the research object, and the information acquisition
   system is utilized to get the current service status information about
   the physical entity. On this basis, combined with the historical service
   information and inherent information of physical entity, the fuzzy
   database is established. Meanwhile, twin data are formed by the clear
   quantification of fuzzy information and data processing technology. In
   accordance with structural characteristic and work cycle process of
   bridge crane, the analytical models of load, strength, defect, and
   fatigue life are established, respectively. The multi-theoretical
   calculation model is completed by encapsulating the analysis models and
   transmitting information, and then the main factors affecting the
   fatigue life of bridge crane structure are determined. With that, the
   comprehensive evaluation coefficient is calculated by the fuzzy
   comprehensive evaluation theory. The response relationship between the
   information data and the fatigue life of bridge crane structure is
   described by the Kriging surrogate model constructed with experimental
   design. Real-time prediction of fatigue life of bridge crane structure
   is realized in a virtual space to depict the life cycle process. Taking
   QD20/10 t x 43 m x 12 m general bridge crane as an example, the
   feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are verified, which
   provides a strong theoretical basis for dependable service and timely
   scrapping of cranes.},

Title = {Software Architecture and Non-Fungible Tokens for Digital Twin
   Decentralized Applications in the Built Environment},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) can enable distributed collaboration,
   enhance data sharing, and automate back-end processes for digital twin
   (DT) decentralized applications (dApps) in the construction industry
   (CI) 4.0. The aim of this paper was to propose a software architecture
   and to develop a framework of smart contracts for blockchain-based
   digital twin (BCDT) dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects in CI
   4.0. This paper leveraged the existing literature and action research
   interviews to identify and validate the critical industry problems,
   functional requirements (FRs), and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to
   be addressed by BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. Basic use cases were developed to
   design a framework of smart contracts for BCDT dApps throughout the
   lifecycle of projects. The analysis of an online survey was used to
   identify the key requirements and enablers to propose a software
   architecture for BCDT applications and to validate the requirements for
   developing the framework of a smart contract for BCDTs. The findings
   were: (1) The identification of key problems in CI 4.0 for each BIM/BCDT
   dimension (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, and contractual (cD)) and the related
   FRs and NFRs for BCDT applications. Additionally, key use cases were
   designed to address the problems identified. (2) The proposed BCDT
   architecture permitted us to narrow gaps in the literature on
   blockchain-based decentralized digital twins. Moreover, the proposed
   BCDT architecture and smart-contract framework addressed the main
   requirements in the literature on BCDTs. (3) The study leveraged the
   non-fungible token (NFT) standard to develop a framework for smart
   contracts that addressed the key use cases and the related industry
   problems and functional requirements that were identified. The study
   also considered the contractual dimension (cD) as an overarching
   dimension in relation to the other BCDT dimensions. (4) We also compared
   the costs of several public blockchains for executing the proposed
   smart-contract framework throughout the lifecycle of a medium-sized
   building project. The cost analysis permitted the development of
   criteria to evaluate the suitability of blockchain networks for BCDT
   applications in CI 4.0 depending on the principal blockchain networks'
   properties (security, decentralization, scalability, and
   interoperability). Finally, this study resulted in a novel framework
   that included software architecture, smart-contract use cases, and
   selection criteria among blockchain networks for BCDT dApps in CI 4.0.},

   management: A case study of solar energy in digital twin},
Journal = {SOLAR ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {262},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {As power system might be damaged and even shut down due to the high
   uncertainty effects, they are always challenged by the high load
   variations. This study proposes a novel technique for managing power in
   microgrids (MGs) that have stochastic loads in the presence of high
   penetration of renewable energy sources. It is likely that the security
   of the users will be violated as a result of centralized optimization
   techniques that require considerable computing power. Conversely, in
   distributed methods, each load and generation are presumed to be linked
   to a single bus, thereby neglecting the electrical grid and its
   limitations. Due to this, the suggested distributed energy management
   strategy (EMS) decomposes the optimization problem into two levels,
   involving the MG centralized controller, local controllers, distribution
   network, and related restrictions. Because it is impossible to predict
   the loads precisely, the loads are regarded as stochastic variables
   which are modeled using probabilistic approach. The moth flame
   optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. A
   distributed EMS has been developed that integrates solar/photovoltaic
   (PV) units, wind turbines, diesel generators, and batteries in a digital
   twin area. Based on the simulations, the suggested distributed EMS is
   shown to be efficient and useful for the practical studies.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Featured Application This work was elaborated in the frame of a
   collaborative innovation project named CyberFactory\#1 which aims at
   enhancing optimization and resilience of Factories of the Future. Its
   outcomes will be tested and demonstrated in application to industrial
   use-cases provided by eight pilot factories across Europe in sectors
   such as aerospace system manufacturing, industrial machine fabrication,
   consumer electronics and textile industry. One of these use-cases is
   provided as an illustration of the approach in the field of Aerospace
   System Manufacturing. In the context of Industry 4.0, a growing use is
   being made of simulation-based decision-support tools commonly named
   Digital Twins. Digital Twins are replicas of the physical manufacturing
   assets, providing means for the monitoring and control of individual
   assets. Although extensive research on Digital Twins and their
   applications has been carried out, the majority of existing approaches
   are asset specific. Little consideration is made of human factors and
   interdependencies between different production assets are commonly
   ignored. In this paper, we address those limitations and propose
   innovations for cognitive modeling and co-simulation which may unleash
   novel uses of Digital Twins in Factories of the Future. We introduce a
   holistic Digital Twin approach, in which the factory is not represented
   by a set of separated Digital Twins but by a comprehensive modeling and
   simulation capacity embracing the full manufacturing process including
   external network dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce novel
   approaches for integrating models of human behavior and capacities for
   security testing with Digital Twins and show how the holistic Digital
   Twin can enable new services for the optimization and resilience of
   Factories of the Future. To illustrate this approach, we introduce a
   specific use-case implemented in field of Aerospace System
   Manufacturing.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of the world population has increased the food demand
   as well as the need for assurance of food quality, safety, and
   sustainability. However, food security can easily be compromised by not
   only natural hazards but also changes in food preferences, political
   conflicts, and food frauds. In order to contribute to building a more
   sustainable food system-digitally visible and processes
   measurable-within this review, we summarized currently available
   evidence for various information and communication technologies (ICTs)
   that can be utilized to support collaborative actions, prevent
   fraudulent activities, and remotely perform real-time monitoring, which
   has become essential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   Internet of Everything, 6G, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and
   digital twin are gaining significant attention in recent years in
   anticipation of leveraging the creativity of human experts in
   collaboration with efficient, intelligent, and accurate machines, but
   with limited consideration in the food supply chain. Therefore, this
   paper provided a thorough review of the food system by showing how
   various ICT tools can help sense and quantify the food system and
   highlighting the key enhancements that Industry 5.0 technologies can
   bring. The vulnerability of the food system can be effectively mitigated
   with the utilization of various ICTs depending on not only the nature
   and severity of crisis but also the specificity of the food supply
   chain. There are numerous ways of implementing these technologies, and
   they are continuously evolving.},

Abstract = {The Digital Twin concept promises numerous applications across
   industries and its physical twin's entire life cycle. Although numerous
   architectures have been proposed to develop and describe the setup of
   Digital Twin applications, current Digital Twin architectures do not
   address the versatile cross-industry character of the Digital Twin
   concept, its safety, security, and privacy aspects, and are often use
   case-specific and inflexible. We propose a three-dimensional Digital
   Twin reference architecture model for application across industries,
   considering functionality, dependability, and life cycle aspects. Our
   model provides practitioners a common platform to develop and discuss
   Digital Twin applications of different complexities and dependability
   aspects along varying life cycles and independent of the industry. Its
   applicability is validated and showcased by examples from the fields of
   mechatronic products, healthcare, construction, transportation,
   astronautics, and the energy sector. We compare our reference
   architecture model to existing architectures, discuss its advantages and
   limitations, and position the model within previous literature.},

Title = {Digital Twin to Detect Nuclear Proliferation: A Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},

Volume = {144},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This case study describes the development of technologies that enable
   digital-engineering and digital-twinning efforts in proliferation
   detection. The project presents a state-of-the-art approach to support
   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards by incorporating
   diversion-pathway analysis, facility misuse, and the detection of
   indicators within the reactor core, applying the safeguards-by-design
   concept, and demonstrates its applicability as a sensitive monitoring
   system for advanced reactors and power plants. There are two pathways a
   proliferating state might take using the reactor core. One is
   ``diversion,{''} where special fissionable nuclear material-i.e.,
   Pu-239, U-233, U enriched in U-233/235-that has been declared to the
   IAEA is removed surreptitiously, either by taking small amounts of
   nuclear material over a long time (known as protracted diversion) or
   large amounts in a short time (known as abrupt diversion). The second
   pathway is ``misuse,{''} where undeclared source material-material that
   can be transmuted into special fissionable nuclear material: depleted
   uranium, natural uranium, and thorium-is placed in the core, where it
   uses the neutron flux for transmutation. Digital twinning and digital
   engineering have demonstrated significant performance improvement and
   schedule reduction in the aerospace, automotive, and construction
   industries. This integrated modeling approach has not been fully applied
   to nuclear safeguards programs in the past. Digital twinning, combined
   with machine learning technologies, can lead to new innovations in
   process-monitoring detection, specifically in event classification,
   real-time notification, and data tampering. It represents a
   technological leap in evaluation and detection capability to safeguard
   any nuclear facility.},

Abstract = {The industrial Internet of Things (IoT) system is integrated with the
   emerging artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms to empower industrial
   automation and self-evolving capabilities. AI-driven resource allocation
   across cyber-physical domains for mobile industrial IoT must consider
   its fundamental requirements and key characteristics such as high
   reliability, low latency, and environmental dynamics. The challenge is
   twofold. Industrial systems are fault-sensitive, which makes them
   intolerable of trial-and-error-based learning and optimization
   approaches. In addition, learning models cannot adapt to changing
   industrial IoT environment with dynamic communication noise and
   machinery disturbances. In this paper, we propose joint optimization for
   the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multi-tier hybrid
   cloud-edge computing empowered industrial IoT that results in improved
   utilization of communication and computing resources. Second, we
   establish the fine-grained digital twin for industrial IoT (DT-IIoT) to
   simulate the changing industrial environment to support
   trial-and-error-based safe learning. Third, we leverage meta
   reinforcement learning (meta RL) to improve the generalization and fast
   adaptation of the learning models for DT-IIoT. Finally, the feasibility
   and efficiency of these schemes are evaluated through extensive
   experiments.},

Abstract = {The rapid development and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
   in modern networks and Industry 4.0 have attracted substantial interest
   from cybersecurity researchers. In this study, we propose a
   software-defined framework that improves network intrusion detection
   systems by using manufacturer usage description (MUD) to enhance the
   behavioral monitoring in IoT networks. We aim to explore whether
   Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices typically serve a common role in
   cyber-physical systems, and their communications exhibit predictable
   patterns that can be defined in MUD profile(s) formally and succinctly.
   We design a framework that utilizes the concept of digital twins and
   software-defined networking to improve the security of IIoT
   environments. The MUD data are profiled, and the actions are evaluated
   on the network digital twin before they are used in the physical
   network. The behavioral profiling system is updated in real time,
   thereby improving the overall system security and compliance to policies
   in the IoT deployment. Evaluation results show that our solution
   outperforms existing approaches substantially in terms of attack
   detection accuracy, predicting security incidents, response time, and
   resource usage.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, human digital twins (HDTs) attracted attention in
   both digital twin (DT) applications and beyond. In this paper, we

   Based on the literature, we identify personal data, model, and interface

   data lake of human data and a model and interface library. Regarding the
   key enabling technologies that support the HDT functions, we envision
   that the internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, data security,
   wearables, human modeling, explainable artificial intelligence (AI),
   minimum viable sensing, and data visualization are closely associated
   with the development of HDTs. Finally, we investigate current

Abstract = {Asa result of the complex structure of laminar cooling water supply
   systems, both facets of strict process requirements and various
   intermittent running conditions could cause challenges of energy -saving
   and equipment upkeep. Given the energy wastage issue of the laminar
   cooling system of hot rolling, this paper develops an optimal scheduling
   system according to digital twin using Online Sequential Extreme
   Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and multi-objective evolutionary optimization
   using Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA). The optimal scheduling
   system according to digital twins can accurately predict the water
   consumption trend of the water supply system and optimize the scheduling
   instructions and operation scheme through dynamic information
   interaction and mapping of process constraints, intermittent operating
   conditions, rolling rhythm, measured data, etc. between physical space
   and virtual space. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method
   can lessen power usage by 13.60\% and water consumption by 10.54\%
   regarding the premise of ensuring what is needed of cooling procedures.
   In addition, the water pump can maintain high effectiveness during
   operation to guarantee the security and stability of laminar cooling
   water supply systems.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the boom in advanced intelligent vehicles, the amount of data
   associated with the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) grows exponentially.
   Sharing road data among vehicles effectively can greatly improve their
   driving efficiency and road experience. This, however, is hindered by
   security concerns, bandwidth limitations, and mobility and communication
   distance between vehicles. In this article, we propose a citywide data
   sharing platform among vehicles based on the digital twin. Specifically,
   we propose a digital twin based vehicular platform on the cloud to
   facilitate the effective data sharing of vehicles. A digital twin is a
   digital representation of a vehicle on the cloud that synchronises data
   with the vehicle in real time. Therefore, data sharing among vehicles
   can be accomplished by their digital twins on the cloud without any
   physical limitations. Considering the data privacy of vehicles, a
   framework that combines federated learning and transfer learning is
   applied which can realise personalised data sharing among vehicles
   without disclosing their data privacy. An incentive mechanism based on
   the game-theoretic approach is devised to combat the mutual distrust
   between vehicles and encourage their contribution to data sharing. By
   sewing the above mechanisms, the proposed digital twin enabled data
   sharing platform can effectively address privacy, bandwidth limitation
   and incentive issues. Using extensive trace-driven simulations, we
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

Title = {Digital Twin for the Oil and Gas Industry: Overview, Research Trends,
   Opportunities, and Challenges},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {104175-104197},
Abstract = {With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O\&G) industry is
   now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity,
   efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and
   operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the
   O\&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows
   O\&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets.
   Considering DT adoption, the O\&G industry is still at an early stage
   with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications
   instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT
   implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related
   technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology,
   the current status of O\&G-related DT research activities, and the
   opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the
   O\&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this
   understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the
   context of the O\&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to
   select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based
   publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as
   Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered
   articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant
   Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and
   conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study.
   These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were
   thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology
   and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of
   DT deployment in the O\&G industry. From this literature review, it was
   found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle
   management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O\&G
   industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty
   in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O\&G
   industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT
   related research in the O\&G industry, the United States (US) is the
   leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China,
   Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall
   publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year
   until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The
   number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of
   conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented
   theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both
   these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O\&G
   industry is still at an early stage.},

Abstract = {In Industry 5.0 vision, machines are empowered with the interaction
   capability to autonomously make local decisions and coordinate with each
   other as well as humans. However, how to form a group consensus on the
   rapid self-organizing of the manufacturing process is critical for
   achieving manufacturing resilience under disturbances and disruptions.
   Based on our formerly developed system ManuChain (Leng et al., 2020),
   this article proposes a blockchained smart contract system (BSCS), named
   ManuChain II, as the digital twin of a decentralized autonomous
   manufacturing system for achieving resilience in Industry 5.0. A
   blockchain-secured multiagent system architecture together with a
   product data model is established to form the BSCS. The BSCS could
   prevent tampering with data and enhance the transparency of the product
   manufacturing process. In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart
   contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing
   architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and
   learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under
   internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with
   communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the
   learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns
   used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving
   the continuous improvement of the system's decentralized autonomous
   intelligence. Via incorporating the decentralized deep learning
   algorithms into blockchained SCs, this study reveals a new way to
   realize the self-organizing intelligence of the manufacturing system for
   enhancing resilience toward Industry 5.0.},

Title = {Exploiting a Real-Time Self-Correcting Digital Twin Model for the Middle

Abstract = {Real-time monitoring and forecasting are essential to ensure an on-time
   and on-demand supply of water diversion projects. However, water
   transfer systems currently lack spatiotemporal data in a dense
   resolution, failing to monitor real-time conditions and test plausible
   scenarios. To address the problem, this paper proposes a novel digital
   twin framework. It includes a real-time self-correcting model, which
   combines (1) a hydraulic solver using the one-dimensional Saint-Venant
   equations; and (2) a method updating hydraulic states driven by field
   observed data. This framework consists of four phases: preparation,
   warming up, tuning, and monitoring and predicting. Particularly in
   monitoring and predicting, an identification method for diagnosing
   abnormal events is also proposed as one of the functions of the twin
   model. The model shows beyond 98\% similarity to reality based on the
   metric similarity (S) proposed in this paper on both of two real-world
   scenarios: a large flow scenario and a normal one. The deviation is
   generally lower than 5 cm for water level 2 m(3)/s for discharge. The
   abnormal situation diagnosis method also provides timely fault detection
   for daily scheduling. It is anticipated that this framework can be a
   powerful tool to estimate current canal states and predict change
   trends, further ensuring the security and efficiency of operations for
   large-scale water diversion projects.},

Title = {Machine Learning Based Transient Stability Emulation and Dynamic System
   Equivalencing of Large-Scale AC-DC Grids for Faster-Than-Real-Time

Abstract = {Modern power systems have been expanding significantly including the
   integration of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, bringing a
   tremendous computational challenge to transient stability simulation for
   dynamic security assessment (DSA). In this work, a practical method for
   energy control center with the machine learning (ML) based synchronous
   generator model (SGM) and dynamic equivalent model (DEM) is proposed to
   reduce the computational burden of the traditional transient stability
   (TS) simulation. The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field
   programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT)
   digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated
   Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM,
   where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line
   simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT (R). A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg
   500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established
   for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation
   platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid,
   multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is
   also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the
   hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT
   ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it
   reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of
   AC-DC grid.},

Title = {Developing a Skilled Workforce for Future Industry Demand: The Potential
   of Digital Twin-Based Teaching and Learning Practices in Engineering
   Education},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Engineering education providers should foresee the potential of digital
   transformation of teaching and skill-developing activities so that
   graduating engineers can find themselves highly aligned with the demands
   and attributes needed by prospective industrial employers. The
   advancement of industrial revolutions towards hybridisation of the
   enabling technologies recognised by Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, and
   Industry 5.0 have transformed the components of the engineering higher
   education system remarkably. Future workforce requirements will demand
   an employee's multidisciplinary skill mix and other professional
   qualities. Implementing human-centric decision-making based on insights
   from the Digital Twin (DT) systems, sustainability, and lean systems is
   necessary for further economic growth. Recent barriers identified by the
   Australian Council of Engineering Deans, the development of teaching
   capabilities, and affordable and digitally transformed learning
   facilities by education providers were all considered. This paper
   explores the role of Digital Twins (DTs) in enhancing engineering higher
   education by incorporating Industry 4.0 components and other industrial
   advances. By reviewing curricula, pedagogy, and the evolving skill
   requirements for engineering graduates, this study identifies key
   benefits of DTs, such as cost-effectiveness, resource management, and
   immersive learning experiences. This paper also outlines challenges in
   implementing DT-based labs, including IT infrastructure, data quality,
   privacy, and security issues. The findings indicate that engineering
   education should embrace DTs to foster multidisciplinary skills and
   human-centric decision-making to meet future workforce demands.
   Collaboration with industry is highlighted as a crucial factor in the
   successful transformation of teaching practices and in offering
   real-world experiences. The COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the adoption
   of DT technologies, demonstrating their utility in minimising
   educational disruptions. While this paper acknowledges the high
   potential of DTs to prepare engineering students for future industry
   demands, it also emphasises the need for professional development among
   educators to ensure effective and balanced implementation.},

Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the popularization of computer and information
   network technology, the core business of more and more industries has
   basically realized informatization office. Although the informatization
   office has brought a lot of convenience to people, the increasingly
   complex informatization infrastructure equipment has also buried many
   hidden dangers for people. More and more security incidents are caused
   by unfamiliarity with these infrastructures. How to use the information
   infrastructure correctly has become a problem considered by more and
   more enterprise information security departments, and the position of IT
   operation and maintenance is born to solve this hidden danger. The IT
   (Internet Technology) operation and maintenance personnel of each
   enterprise formulate a set of operational risk quantitative assessment
   models for the enterprise based on the internal information
   infrastructure equipment of the enterprise so that the enterprise staff
   can use these infrastructure equipment efficiently and safely. This
   paper focused on the quantitative assessment model of IT operation and
   maintenance operation risk constructed by the digital twin model. The
   quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation
   risk constructed by the digital twin model was compared with the
   quantitative assessment model of IT operation and maintenance operation
   risk constructed by other traditional models. The comparison results
   showed that the output results of the evaluation model constructed by
   the digital twin model were closer to the actual results, and the
   accuracy rate was 35.9\% higher than that of the previous operational
   risk assessment model.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Intertwining smart manufacturing and the Internet of Things (IoT) is
   known as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT improves product
   quality and reliability and requires intelligent connection, real-time
   data processing, collaborative monitoring, and automatic information
   processing. Recently, it has been increasingly deployed; however,
   multi-party collaborative information processing is often required in
   heterogeneous IIoT. The security and efficiency requirements of each
   party interacting with other partners have become a significant
   challenge in information security. This paper proposes an automated
   smart manufacturing framework based on Digital Twin (DT) and Blockchain.
   The data used in the DT are all from the cluster generated after
   blockchain authentication. The processed data in the DT will only be
   accessed and visualized in the cloud when necessary. Therefore, all the
   data transmitted in the process are result reports, avoiding the
   frequent transmission of sensitive data. Simulation results show that
   the proposed authentication mode takes less time than the standard
   protocol. In addition, our DT framework for a smart factory deploys the
   PDQN DRL model, proving to have higher accuracy, stability, and
   reliability.},

Abstract = {Recently, the proposed Cybertwin-driven 6G network architecture has
   attracted attentions from academia, which can support the communication
   anchor, security agent and other functions for physical devices.
   Especially, Cybertwin can provide promising Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
   applications in future. However, security and privacy of Cybertwin still
   face various threats and challenges, which may impact future deployments
   for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. In this paper, we first introduce the
   architecture and promising applications of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X.
   Then, we analyze essential data security and privacy preservation
   requirements for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. Particularly, we present the
   security reference architecture of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. As a case
   study, we investigate the migration of Cybertwin caused by vehicle
   mobility, and propose a handover authentication scheme to create new
   Cybertwin between vehicle and edge server based on proxy ring signature
   technique. Finally, we discuss several open research directions for

Abstract = {Oil and Gas Pipeline (OGP) projects face a wide scope of wellbeing and
   security Risk Factors (RFs) all around the world, especially in the oil
   and gas delivering nations having influencing climate and unsampled
   data. Lacking data about the reasons for pipeline risk predictor and
   unstructured data about the security of the OGP prevent endeavors of
   moderating such dangers. This paper, subsequently, means to foster a
   risk analyzing framework in view of a comprehensive methodology of
   recognizing, dissecting and positioning the related RFs, and assessing
   the conceivable pipeline characteristics. Hazard Mitigation Methods
   (HMMs), which are the initial steps of this approach. A new methodology
   has been created to direct disappointment investigation of pinhole
   erosion in pipelines utilizing the typical pipeline risk strategy and
   erosion climate reenactments during a full life pattern of the pipeline.
   Hence in the proposed work, manifold learning with rank based clustering
   algorithm is incorporated with the cloud server for improved data
   analysis. The probability risk rate is identified from the burst
   pressure by clustering the normal and leak category to improve the
   accuracy of the prediction system experimented on the lab-scale oil
   pipeline system. The numerical results like auto-correlation,
   periodogram, Laplace transformed P-P Plot are utilized to estimate the
   datasets restructured by the manifold learning approach. The obtained
   experimental results shows that the cloud server datasets are clustered
   with rank prioritization to make proactive decision in faster manner by
   distinguishing labelled and unlabeled pressure attributes.},

Abstract = {Information is the basis of decision security. In the era of big data,
   information is everywhere, and risks are everywhere. Information leakage
   incidents are frequently exposed, bringing many hidden dangers to users.
   While artificial intelligence brings convenience to people, it also
   inevitably brings crises. This paper aims to study the information
   security laws and regulations of users in the intelligent age and find
   the reasons for the leakage of user information. This paper proposes to
   calculate decision risk with the help of mobile edge computing
   technology. It builds a digital twin risk simulation model to make
   better risk decisions. The experimental results of this paper show that
   improving relevant laws and regulations can significantly reduce
   decision-making risks and improve decision-making efficiency by 20\%.},

Title = {Digital Twin-Based Cyber-Attack Detection Framework for Cyber-Physical
   Manufacturing Systems},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 22},
Abstract = {Smart manufacturing (SM) systems utilize run-time data to improve
   productivity via intelligent decision-making and analysis mechanisms on
   both machine and system levels. The increased adoption of cyber-physical
   systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical
   manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making
   mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor.
   Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to
   cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products,
   or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting
   cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward
   implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper
   addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first
   challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from
   cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of
   cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop
   controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising
   solution for providing additional insights into the physical process
   (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work,
   we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during
   controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the
   physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on
   structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection.
   Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D
   printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to
   illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Note to
   Practitioners-This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and
   extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for
   manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized
   attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical
   manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a
   key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we
   identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is
   due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on
   how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control
   systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs
   utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and
   subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation
   tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers
   that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints. We
   utilize a model predictive controller on an off-the-shelf 3D printer to
   run the process, and stage anomalies and cyber-attacks that are
   successfully detected by the proposed framework.},

Title = {Application of Digital Twin Combined with Artificial Intelligence and 5G
   Technology in the Art Design of Digital Museums},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {More and more museums are being established or restored as people's
   cultural levels grow. A digital twin is a computerized representation of
   the physical object or phenomenon, which acts as its real-time digital
   equivalent. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly
   widespread, and museums and art shows will need to change their old
   working and thinking processes to fully fulfill their potential. In an
   increasingly digital world, combining AI technologies and wearable
   devices into digital museums could assist in boosting involvement. It is
   necessary to investigate AI's strategic function and application in
   affecting tourist experiences at art galleries and museums, as well as
   its potential to improve education. Also, digital twin (DT) paves the
   way to alleviate difficulties or might improve access to digital museums
   via digital experiences. The historical report recommends that digital
   museum items be represented in a way that poses the fewest threats to
   its legitimacy. Owing to its uniqueness and vulnerability to substantial
   environmental dangers, the safeguarding of art and cultural heritage in
   digital museums is a serious issue. There are many approaches for
   assessing the state of artistic heritage and protecting it from extreme
   acts. The current study offers a framework for digitized museum art
   design based on the utilization of digital twin (DT), artificial
   intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation (5G) technologies. Further to
   enhance the security of the system, we employ the improved blowfish
   encryption algorithm (IBEA). Also, the authentication is done using the
   Diffie-Hellman protocol. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB,
   and its performance is analyzed and compared with conventional systems.
   From the result obtained, it was revealed that the suggested methodology
   express high range of security level (95\%) than the existing
   mechanisms. This study is very important in two directions: (1) it
   presents an analytical structure for having to adapt digital information
   to complicated systems in museums and (2) it explains the artistic
   obstacles for heritage properties, such as accessibility, execution
   time, security level, and the efficiency of 3-dimensional designs.},

Abstract = {Digital twins (DT) have been proposed to support and enhance
   manufacturing processes of the industries. The outcome of adopting DT is
   so encouraging that it is hoped that more than 50\% of the large
   industries will benefit from DT by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, DT
   lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers
   for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated
   structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure
   and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain
   technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers
   from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum
   attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely
   twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction
   confirmation. This article also presents a framework for deployment of
   twinchain for manufacturing of a robot surgical machine.},

   Continuous Lifecycle Integration},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Hospital buildings usually contain sophisticated facility systems and
   special medical equipment, strict security requirements, and business
   systems. Traditional methods such as BIM are becoming less capable of
   real-time updates of building status and big data volume. By proposing
   innovations both in technique and management-a ``continuous lifecycle
   integration{''} method based on the concept of Digital Twin (DT) and
   ``early movement{''} of the general contractor, this paper reported a
   successful project case in a large hospital in China. The case realized
   continuous, scheduled integration of static data and dynamic data of
   more than 20 management systems from the design, construction, pre-O\&M
   phase up to the O\&M phase. Then, a DT software system with real-time
   visual management and artificial intelligent diagnosis modules was
   developed and deployed in a newly built DT control center. Managers have
   the ability to grasp the detailed status of the whole hospital by visual
   management and receive timely facility diagnosis and operation
   suggestions that are automatically sent back from the digital building
   to reality. The case has been steadily running for more than a year in
   the hospital and achieved desired performance by reducing energy
   consumption, avoiding facility faults, reducing the number of requested
   repairs, and enhancing the quality of daily maintenance work.},

Title = {Holistic Security and Safety for Factories of the Future},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The accelerating transition of traditional industrial processes towards
   fully automated and intelligent manufacturing is being witnessed in
   almost all segments. This major adoption of enhanced technology and
   digitization processes has been originally embraced by the Factories of
   the Future and Industry 4.0 initiatives. The overall aim is to create
   smarter, more sustainable, and more resilient future-oriented factories.
   Unsurprisingly, introducing new production paradigms based on
   technologies such as machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things
   (IoT), and robotics does not come at no cost as each newly incorporated
   technique poses various safety and security challenges. Similarly, the
   integration required between these techniques to establish a unified and
   fully interconnected environment contributes to additional threats and
   risks in the Factories of the Future. Accumulating and analyzing
   seemingly unrelated activities, occurring simultaneously in different
   parts of the factory, is essential to establish cyber situational
   awareness of the investigated environment. Our work contributes to these
   efforts, in essence by envisioning and implementing the SMS-DT, an
   integrated platform to simulate and monitor industrial conditions in a
   digital twin-based architecture. SMS-DT is represented in a three-tier
   architecture comprising the involved data and control flows: edge,
   platform, and enterprise tiers. The goal of our platform is to capture,
   analyze, and correlate a wide range of events being tracked by sensors
   and systems in various domains of the factory. For this aim, multiple
   components have been developed on the basis of artificial intelligence
   to simulate dominant aspects in industries, including network analysis,
   energy optimization, and worker behavior. A data lake was also used to
   store collected information, and a set of intelligent services was
   delivered on the basis of innovative analysis and learning approaches.
   Finally, the platform was tested in a textile industry environment and
   integrated with its ERP system. Two misuse cases were simulated to track
   the factory machines, systems, and people and to assess the role of
   SMS-DT correlation mechanisms in preventing intentional and
   unintentional actions. The results of these misuse case simulations
   showed how the SMS-DT platform can intervene in two domains in the first
   scenario and three in the second one, resulting in correlating the
   alerts and reporting them to security operators in the multi-domain
   intelligent correlation dashboard.},

Title = {Case Study of the Use of a Digital Twin for Leak Detection and
   Quantification in Underground Gas Storage Wells},
Journal = {SPE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2415-2424},

Abstract = {Underground gas storage (UGS) wells are essential components in energy
   security. However, UGS wells present a complicated and delicate
   combination of elements where ensuring safe and secure functionality
   over long periods is paramount. This paper showcases how a digital twin
   is used to evaluate and forecast the link between leaks and temperature
   and pressure trends in a UGS well, allowing the identification and
   quantification of defects and, subsequently, well barrier integrity. The
   digital twin used for this application presents advantages compared with
   other solutions present on the market with regard to the simplified
   configuration; that is, with minimal input data, the system can produce
   an accurate and useful output, which is then used in the well integrity
   decision- making process. UGS wells present additional criticalities
   with respect to normal production wells due to their longer life span
   and the repetitive production and injection cycles. This makes early and
   accurate leak detection essential for the safe management of the well
   barriers. The proposed digital twin simulates the trends of pressure and
   temperature within each annulus and compares results with data from the
   field, allowing the identification of the position and size of leaks. A
   genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the placement of leaks on their
   specific barriers. Once a leak is identified, a risk assessment is
   conducted to evaluate the overall integrity of the well. If the status
   of the well is found to be critical enough, an intervention may be
   planned. The studies presented show how the digital twin has been used
   on two wells with similar problems. At first, it has confirmed the
   necessity to put the well out of service as opposed to planning
   maintenance, thereby saving both time and cost. In the second case, it
   allowed the validation of a solution that led to a 60\% reduction in
   failure consequence, allowing the well to continue operating without
   major costs or risks. The errors of the resulting simulations were
   always confined within the 0.5 bar limit highlighting its accuracy. The
   system has been in use for over a year and has shown great potential in
   accurate and efficient identification of leaks. This has accelerated the
   process of well integrity evaluation and allowed timely interventions on
   wells that required it. On the other hand, the process has highlighted
   cases where previous assumptions about leak location and size were
   corrected using the digital twin, therefore reducing the costs of
   interventions. Finally, the model showcases a clear readiness for
   predictive capabilities aimed to select, plan, and design fit for
   purpose mitigating actions.},

Title = {Security and Privacy on 6G Network Edge: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1095-1127},
Abstract = {To meet the stringent service requirements of 6G applications such as
   immersive cloud eXtended Reality (XR), holographic communication, and
   digital twin, there is no doubt that an increasing number of servers
   will be deployed on the network edge. Then, the techniques, edge
   computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence will be more widely
   utilized for intelligent local data storage and processing generated by
   6G applications, while innovative access network architecture based on
   the cloud-edge servers, such as the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN)
   will be adopted to improve the flexibility and openness for new service
   deployment and frequent network changes. On the other hand, new attack
   surfaces and vectors targeting local infrastructure and users will
   emerge along with the deployment of novel network architecture and
   techniques. Massive researchers have studied the potential security and
   privacy threats on the 6G network edge as well as the countermeasures.
   The three techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge
   intelligence have become a double-edged sword that can not only be
   synchronously utilized to develop defense countermeasures, but also
   become the targets of many new security and privacy threats. In this
   article, we provide a comprehensive survey of articles on the three
   techniques-related security threats and countermeasures on the 6G
   network edge. We explain how security and privacy can be destroyed by
   attacking one of the three technologies and how the three services
   support each other to realize efficient and achievable security
   protection. Moreover, the researches on the benefits and limitations of
   Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain for decentralized edge network
   systems in terms of security and privacy are also investigated.
   Additionally, we also analyze the existing challenges and future
   directions towards 6G.},

Title = {Models in the Construction of Accounting Informatization Transformation
   Based on Digital Twin},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {The construction of accounting informatization is an effective tool for
   enterprises to transform from focusing on financial accounting to
   focusing on group management and decision support. Digital twins make
   full use of physical models, sensor updates and other data, integrate
   interdisciplinary and multi-scale modeling processes, and perform
   complete mapping in virtual space, which can reflect the process of the
   entire life cycle of the corresponding physical equipment. Based on the
   technology of digital twin, this paper solved the related problems in
   the transformation and construction of accounting informatization, and
   proposed a clustering analysis algorithm. Company A was taken as the
   experimental object, companies B and C were taken as the experimental
   control group, combined with data analysis, among the accountants of
   company A, 179 people have a supportive attitude towards the
   transformation of accounting information, 16 people have a neutral
   attitude, and 5 people have an opposing attitude, accounting for 89.5\%,
   8\% and 2.5\% respectively. However, among companies B and C, 196 and
   199 people hold a favorable attitude, accounting for 98\% and 99.5\%
   respectively. The experimental results showed that the acceptance of the
   accounting informatization transformation is still relatively high among
   the employees of the enterprise.},

Title = {Digital Twin for Transportation Big Data: A Reinforcement Learning-Based
   Network Traffic Prediction Approach},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 18},
Abstract = {Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), as the crucial support of
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), have received great attention
   in recent years. With the rapid development of VANETs, various services
   have generated a great deal of data that can be used for transportation
   planning and safe driving. Especially, with the advent of Coronavirus
   Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transportation system has been impacted,
   thus novel modes of transportation planning and intelligent applications
   are necessary. Digital twins can provide powerful support for artificial
   intelligence applications in Transportation Big Data (TBD). The features
   of VANETs are varying, which arises the main challenge of digital twins
   applying in TBD. Network traffic prediction, as part of digital twins,
   is useful for network management and security in VANETs, such as network
   planning and anomaly detection. This paper proposes a network traffic
   prediction algorithm aiming at time-varying traffic flows with a large
   number of fluctuations. This algorithm combines Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
   and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for network traffic feature
   extraction. DQN is leveraged to carry out network traffic prediction, in
   which GAN is involved to represent Q-network. Meanwhile, the generative
   network can increase the number of samples to improve the prediction
   error. We evaluate the performance of our method by implementing it on
   three real network traffic data sets. Finally, we compare the two
   state-of-the-art competing methods with our method.},

Title = {Resilient Output Containment Control of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems
   Against Composite Attacks: A Digital Twin Approach},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 20},
Abstract = {This article delves into the distributed resilient output containment
   control of heterogeneous multiagent systems against composite attacks,
   including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, false-data injection (FDI)
   attacks, camouflage attacks, and actuation attacks. Inspired by digital
   twin technology, a twin layer (TL) with higher security and privacy is
   employed to decouple the above problem into two tasks: 1) defense
   protocols against DoS attacks on TL and 2) defense protocols against
   actuation attacks on the cyber-physical layer (CPL). Initially,
   considering modeling errors of leader dynamics, distributed observers
   are introduced to reconstruct the leader dynamics for each follower on
   TL under DoS attacks. Subsequently, distributed estimators are utilized
   to estimate follower states based on the reconstructed leader dynamics
   on the TL. Then, decentralized solvers are designed to calculate the
   output regulator equations on CPL by using the reconstructed leader
   dynamics. Simultaneously, decentralized adaptive attack-resilient
   control schemes are proposed to resist unbounded actuation attacks on
   the CPL. Furthermore, the aforementioned control protocols are applied
   to demonstrate that the followers can achieve uniformly ultimately
   bounded (UUB) convergence, with the upper bound of the UUB convergence
   being explicitly determined. Finally, we present a simulation example
   and an experiment to show the effectiveness of the proposed control
   scheme.},

Abstract = {Smart home systems are both technologically and economically advancing
   rapidly. As people become gradually inalienable to smart home
   infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more
   closely tied to everyone's privacy and safety. In this paper, we
   consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or
   benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even
   physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home
   environment and interacting with human activities and environmental
   changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on
   permission-based access control, failing to provide ideal protections
   against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this
   paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security
   framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the
   smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed
   in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used
   to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence.
   CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app
   commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any
   risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and
   environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence
   implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung
   SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially
   dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic Author:

   the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our
   CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by Jia et al. 2017,
   and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones
   actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the
   smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign
   SmartApps with logic errors developed by Celik et al. 2017, and achieved
   a 100\% accuracy. Our experimental studies indicate that adopting
   CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) has brought new promises of
   efficiency in our daily lives by integrating AI with the IoT. However,
   owing to limited resources (e.g., computational power), it is difficult
   to implement modern technology (e.g., AI) and improve its performance
   (i.e., the IoT). Moreover, cyberthreats and privacy challenges can
   hinder the success of the IoT. This situation is aggravated by network
   scarcity (i.e., limited network connectivity). This article presents a
   digital twin-based data aggregation scheme in which data are collected
   using federated learning by operating a drone and stored securely in the
   blockchain. Before data sharing, differential privacy is realized to
   enhance privacy. A multirole training scheme is proposed, along with a
   duplex model verification architecture using a Hampel filter and
   performance check. To validate the specifications, an authentication
   scheme was implemented by combining a cuckoo filter and timeframe check.
   A case study to construct an experimental environment using real
   hardware is discussed. Different experiments were conducted in this
   environment and the feasibility of the proposed scheme was validated
   from the outcomes.},

Abstract = {In today's world, it is anticipated that DTw and IoRT will transform the
   idea of digital healthcare and advancement of it what was previously
   unknown. DTw is (physical or virtual) machines or computer-based models
   capable of mimicking or ``twinning `` the lives of actual entities such
   as objects, humans, or human-related features. Since the advent of
   digital and smart healthcare, the world has swiftly integrated several
   technologies in healthcare to support improved patient service, extend
   life expectancy, and lower healthcare expenses.DTw and IoRT are
   promising technologies and great improvements in this field. In recent
   years, the concepts of IoRT and DTw have captured the interest of the
   surgical sector. The flawless integration of data between a physical and
   virtual machine in either direction is the best way to conduct smart
   surgery. Artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, various kinds of
   robotic equipment, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are our pillars of
   completing the task. Using the DTw technological framework and IoRT
   infrastructure, this review paper proposes a comparative overview of
   traditional and IoRT collaborated DTwT and executes an adaptive
   perspective, opportunities, and challenges in the healthcare sector,
   namely surgical advances. This is an important addition to digital
   surgeries and to improve healthcare operations. Our literature review
   has sorted them according to research areas: the technological
   innovation, the prospective and opportunities we have, problems facing
   the surgical industry today and in the future, and offers an evaluation
   of the enabling technologies for the betterment of employing DTw and
   IoRT for the developing and secure surgical sector for both patients and
   doctors.},

Abstract = {New industrial paradigms, such as the Industrial Internet of Things
   (IIoT) and Industry 5.0, are emerging in industrial contexts with the
   aim of fostering quality in operational processes. With the expected
   launch of 6G in the coming years, IIoT networks in Industry 5.0
   ecosystems can leverage 6G technology and its support for training
   machine learning models using Digital Twins (DTs), embedded in DT
   Networks (DTNs), to transparently and continuously optimize their
   communications. Unfortunately, the use of these technologies, in turn,
   intensifies the attack surface and poses a serious threat to the new
   goals of Industry 5.0, such as improving the user experience,
   sustainability and resilience. This article therefore proposes a layered
   protection framework for 6G-enabled IIoT environments, where not only
   DTs and DTNs are fully protected, but also the whole 6G ecosystem,
   complying with the expected goals of Industry 5.0. To achieve this, the
   framework identifies for each protection layer a set of security and
   privacy services to subsequently relate them to existing computing
   infrastructures (cloud, edge, edge-cloud) and provide the best approach
   for future IIoT deployments.},

Title = {Automated Container Terminal Production Operation and Optimization via
   an AdaBoost-Based Digital Twin Framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT), machine learning, and industrial Internet of things
   (IIoT) provide great potential for the transformation of the container
   terminal from automation to intelligence. The production control in the
   loading and unloading process of automated container terminals (ACTs)
   involves complex situations, which puts forward high requirements for
   efficiency and safety. To realize the real-time optimization and
   security of the ACT, a framework integrating DT with the AdaBoost
   algorithm is proposed in this study. The framework is mainly composed of
   physical space, a data service platform, and virtual space, in which the
   twin space and service system constitute virtual space. In the proposed
   framework, a multidimensional and multiscale DT model in twin space is
   first built through a 3D MAX and U3D technology. Second, we introduce a
   random forest and XGBoost to compare with AdaBoost to select the best
   algorithm to train and optimize the DT mechanism model. Third, the
   experimental results show that the AdaBoost algorithm is better than
   others by comparing the performance indexes of model accuracy, root mean
   square error, interpretable variance, and fitting error. In addition, we
   implement empirical experiments by different scales to further evaluate
   the proposed framework. The experimental results show that the mode of
   the DT-based terminal operation has higher loading and unloading
   efficiency than that of the conventional terminal operation, increasing
   by 23.34\% and 31.46\% in small-scale and large-scale problems,
   respectively. Moreover, the visualization service provided by the DT
   system can monitor the status of automation equipment in real time to
   ensure the safety of operation.},

Title = {Digital Reconstruction Method of Power Metering Production Data Based on
   Digital Twin Technology},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {With the continuous improvement of the integration and intelligence of
   ubiquitous power Internet of things system equipment, its cost in life
   cycle management such as data service, operation monitoring, and safety
   protection is becoming higher and higher. At the same time, the
   probability of power grid failure, reduced operation efficiency, and
   function failure will gradually increase with the development of its
   scale. Accurately evaluating the metering performance of distribution
   network digital metering system in the operation of power system and
   improving its accuracy, stability, and reliability are the key issues
   for its future use in power trade settlement. In this paper, a digital
   reconstruction method of power metering production data based on digital
   twin is proposed. The operation data of power system is collected in
   real time through the data acquisition module, the operation data is
   analysed, identified, and predicted, and then the analysis,
   identification, and prediction results are used to realize the
   visualization and digitization of operation data. Further, the operation
   data of the digital metering system are monitored and analysed to verify
   the effectiveness of the method. The advantages and disadvantages of the
   design scheme of the digital metering system are obtained by analysing
   the active power error, which provides the basis of practice and
   selection for the application of the digital metering system.},

Title = {Convergence of Digital Twin and 6G enabled Edge Intelligence: Theories,
   Algorithms and Applications},
Journal = {CHINA COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {III-VI},

Abstract = {With the growing maturity of the advanced edge-cloud collaboration and
   integrated sensing-communication-computing systems, edge intelligence
   has been envisioned as one of the enabling technologies for ubiquitous
   and latency-sensitive machine learning based services in future wireless
   systems. However, with the ever-growing scale of the edge-cloud systems
   as well as the rapid advances in future 6G technologies, there exists a
   critical issue that limits the deep penetration of future 6G enabled
   edge intelligence services, i.e., how to accurately evaluate the
   performance when leveraging the emerging yet pre-matured technologies,
   protocols, and algorithms into the existing systems. The recent advanced
   Digital Twin (DT) has been envisioned to provide a fault-tolerant and
   low-cost platform for accurately simulating and evaluating the emerging
   technologies, protocols, and algorithms, without causing any negative
   influence on the existing systems. The essence of DT aims at enabling a
   systematic and fully digitalized modeling systems that can produce
   accurate digital model of the corresponding physical identity in the
   DT-space. By simulating the digital models in the DT-space, DT can
   accurately and reliably predict and estimate the dynamics and evolutions
   of the physical networks during the entire life cycle, thus providing a
   timely and risk-free methodology for evaluating the performance when
   adopting the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and
   algorithms for network management. Therefore, DT has been considered as
   an efficient scheme for addressing the challenging issue to 6G enabled
   edge intelligence, and thus has attracted lots of interests from both
   academia and industries. It is observed that DT and edge intelligence
   can benefit each other, which thus yields a deep convergence of
   themselves. On the one hand, the increasing network scale, complexity,
   and security risks of edge intelligence raise more challenges to the
   security and reliability. DT can accurately simulate and predict the
   performance of edge intelligence services and thus provide accurate
   benchmark references for edge services. On the other hand, to enable
   accurate mapping and real-time synchronization between the physical
   identifies and their digital models, DT necessitates massive sensing of
   the targeted physical identifies as well as the consequent data
   analytics and modeling. Moreover, efficient yet low-latency
   transmissions of the sensing data and the data analytics (e.g., the
   inference models) are required. 6G edge intelligence can naturally
   provide a solution to these requirements. Therefore, this special issue
   focuses on the convergence of DT and 6G enabled Edge Intelligence, from
   the perspectives of theories, algorithms, and applications.},

Abstract = {In order to solve the problem of personal information leakage caused by

   the analysis of each shopping link. Analyze the interactions and
   interactions between digital twins and the big data industry supporting
   them, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and online commerce. The
   results show that among all respondents, the perception of personal
   information security in the process of online shopping is
   ``uncertain{''}, accounting for 40.78\%. Secondly, the proportion of
   ``agree{''} and ``fully agree{''} information security is 38.47\% and
   9.54\% respectively, while the proportion of ``completely disagree{''}
   personal information security is only 1.47\%, which shows that consumers
   are more confident in personal information security in online shopping,
   and also reflects consumers' lack of perception of existing threats in
   online shopping. This shows that a considerable number of consumers
   believe that the online shopping cart and order information are safe,
   showing their trust in the online shopping website.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of Digital Twin-Assisted Simulation Method for
   Autonomous Vehicle in Car-Following Scenario},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {The automated system replaces the driver, which makes autonomous vehicle
   to improve safety and convenience, so the market of autonomous vehicle
   is huge. However, the real-world application of autonomous vehicles
   faces many challenges due to the immaturity of automated systems. As a
   consequence, simulation verification plays an irreplaceable role in the
   application of autonomous vehicle (AV). Car-following is the most common
   driving scenario in mixed traffic flows, so it is essential to develop
   an appropriate and effective simulation method for AV. Combined with the
   existing AV simulation methods and digital twin (DT) technology, this
   paper proposes a DT-assisted method for AV simulation in a car-following
   scenario. The method makes the physical vehicle interact with the DT
   vehicle, and the DT vehicle can dynamically regulate the physical
   entities through real-time simulation data; the simulation verification
   can be displayed in the DT scenario to ensure the security of the
   simulation. Meanwhile, a DT-assisted simulation framework of AV is
   proposed, the framework includes physical entity components, DT
   components, and data processing and evaluation components. Besides, a
   DT-assisted simulation platform is developed base on Unity engine.
   Finally, the DT-assisted simulation of AV in the car-following scenario
   is implemented in field experiment. The experimental results show that
   the proposed method can be effectively conducted AV simulation in
   car-following, and the average of communication latency is 52.3 ms,
   which is smaller than the update frequency 15 Hz (66.6 ms) between
   DT-assisted platform and AV. The DT-assisted simulation method of AV
   proposed in this paper is applied in the car-following scenario, which
   effectively solves the challenges of car-following scenario simulation
   through virtual-real interaction.},

   Streaming: Reducing Transmission Latency in the Extended
   Reality-Assisted Vehicular Metaverse},
Journal = {IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 17},
Abstract = {The vehicular metaverse is expected to provide a widely connected
   virtual Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where extended reality (XR) is one
   of the critical infrastructures. However, the combination of XR and
   automated vehicle (AV) networks brings several significant challenges,
   e.g., low-latency XR panoramic video transmission, high bandwidth, and
   the high mobility of vehicles. This article introduces digital twin (DT)
   and artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered panoramic video streaming for
   XR-assisted connected AVs to reduce transmission latency and
   intelligently respond to user requirements. Specifically, we propose a
   DT-enabled distributed XR service management framework to provide
   low-latency and smooth XR services across different domains in the
   vehicular metaverse. In addition, we present a case study on XR
   streaming-based virtualized resource allocation and propose a novel deep
   reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method to minimize transmission
   latency. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the positive
   role of AI in connected AV networks can be enhanced by DTs. Finally,
   open issues and potential research directions for the XR-assisted

Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Transportation electrification has been fueled by recent advancements in
   the technology and manufacturing of battery systems, but the industry
   yet is facing serious challenges that could be addressed using
   cutting-edge digital technologies. One such novel technology is based on
   the digital twining of battery systems. Digital twins (DTs) of batteries
   utilize advanced multi-layer models, artificial intelligence, advanced
   sensing units, Internet-of-Things technologies, and cloud computing
   techniques to provide a virtual live representation of the real battery
   system (the physical twin) to improve the performance, safety, and
   cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, they orchestrate the operation of the
   entire battery value chain offering great advantages, such as improving
   the economy of manufacturing, re-purposing, and recycling processes. In
   this context, various studies have been carried out discussing the DT
   applications and use cases from cloud-enabled battery management systems
   to the digitalization of battery testing. This work provides a
   comprehensive review of different possible use cases, key enabling
   technologies, and requirements for battery DTs. The review inclusively
   discusses the use cases, development/integration platforms, as well as
   hardware and software requirements for implementation of the battery
   DTs, including electrical topics related to the modeling and algorithmic
   approaches, software architec-tures, and digital platforms for DT
   development and integration. The existing challenges are identified and
   circumstances that will create enough value to justify these challenges,

Title = {A study on cloud and edge computing for the implementation of digital
   twins in the Oil \& Gas industries},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {In the Oil and Gas industry, minor accidents can negatively affect
   people, the environment, and the enterprise on a grand scale. For this
   type of business, it is crucial to have adequate monitoring and
   maintenance operational routines. The concept of digital twins has been
   widely discussed as an industrial solution capable of monitoring objects
   in real-time, predicting their state, integrity, and safety conditions,
   and providing user feedback. This analysis can also perform predictive
   maintenance and estimate efficiency levels. This paper follows a
   systematic approach and inspects the current state of digital twin
   adoption by the Oil and Gas industry, along with cloud and edge
   utilization in both scenarios. The survey was conducted by filtering and
   selecting articles published in three different queries regarding
   digital twins in the Oil and Gas industry, cloud and edge usage in
   digital twins, and cloud and edge usage in the Oil and Gas industry. The
   selected articles were classified and reviewed to present an overview of
   the current literature regarding digital twins in the oil and gas
   industry and evaluate cloud-based solutions for digital twins in this
   context. This review found that cloud and edge adoption in the Oil and
   Gas industry was late compared to other industries, mainly because of
   security and data privacy concerns. Digital twin adoption across all
   industries is still in its infancy, as most of the current works are
   theoretical or present partial implementations, which often follow
   different digital twin definitions. Cloud and edge computing grant
   access to increased storage and computational capabilities and decouple
   the necessity of relying on a robust local IT infrastructure, being
   critical enabling factors for digital twin implementation.},

Title = {Distributed Digital Twins as Proxies-Unlocking Composability and
   Flexibility for Purpose-Oriented Digital Twins},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {137577-137593},
Abstract = {In the realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial
   Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Digital Twins (DTs) have revolutionized
   the management of physical entities. However, existing implementations
   often face constraints due to hardware-centric approaches and limited
   flexibility. This article introduces a transformative paradigm that
   harnesses the potential of distributed digital twins as proxies,
   enabling software-centricity and unlocking composability and flexibility
   for purpose-oriented digital twin development and deployment. The
   proposed microservices-based architecture, rooted in service-oriented
   architecture (SOA) and microservices principles, emphasizes reusability,
   modularity, and scalability. Leveraging the Lean Digital Twin
   Methodology and packaged business capabilities expedites digital twin
   creation and deployment, facilitating dynamic responses to evolving
   industrial demands. This architecture segments the industrial realm into
   physical and virtual spaces, where core components are responsible for
   digital twin management, deployment, and secure interactions. By
   abstracting and virtualizing physical entities into individual digital
   twins, this approach lays the groundwork for purpose-oriented composite
   digital twin creation. Our key contributions involve a comprehensive
   exposition of the architecture, a practical proof-of-concept (PoC)
   implementation, and the application of the architecture in a use-case
   scenario. Additionally, we provide an analysis, including a quantitative
   evaluation of the proxy aspect and a qualitative comparison with
   traditional approaches. This assessment emphasizes key properties such
   as reusability, modularity, abstraction, discoverability, and security,
   transcending the limitations of contemporary industrial systems and
   enabling agile, adaptable digital proxies to meet modern industrial
   demands.},

Title = {Cyber-resilience of Critical Cyber Infrastructures: Integrating digital
   twins in the electric power ecosystem},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This contribution presents a model for cyber-resilience of critical
   cyber infrastructures (CCI) based on the implementation of a digital
   twin. It addresses the risks associated with the in-tegration of
   computational, communication and physical aspects of CCIs. We focus
   specifi-cally on cybersecurity in the electric power sector due both to
   its salience and to the poten-tial risks associated to failures in
   guaranteeing resilience. Informed by the literature on in-formation
   security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational
   pic-ture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs' actors
   with increased cyber sit-uational awareness, common understanding of
   incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the
   model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of
   cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole. We develop
   a process model and validate three design propositions through a
   formative evaluation in the context of a digital twin implementation in
   the EU electrical power sector. We discuss the implications of this
   model for further research as well as practical applications for the
   electrical power sector. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The intelligence and integrity of a real-time cyber-physical system
   depend on how trustworthy the data's legitimacy, appropriation, and
   authorization are during end-to-end communication between the
   participating nodes in its network. With the recurrent repugnant global
   violations of the airspace by drones and their derivatives, there is an
   urgent need to empirically evaluate the underlying security
   architectures that govern drone usage operations for priority logistics.
   This review examines the significant contribution of artificial
   intelligence models and blockchain to the development of trustworthy and
   reliable intelligent and secure autonomous systems by integrating
   cyberspace, intelligence space, and airspace security. PRISMA-SPIDER
   methodology was adopted for the systematic review of 133 articles based
   on the inclusion criteria consisting of 91 (68.4\%) quantitative
   studies, 19 qualitative studies (14.2\%), and 23 (17.3\%) mixed method
   studies to balance article selection sensitivity and specificity. The
   review outcome shows a significant disconnect between model proposals
   and actual implementation. Through the incorporation of zero-trust
   architecture into the existing blockchain technology and the convergence
   of newer AI models, dynamic security issues like drone ownership
   authentication, drone package delivery verification, drone operation
   authorization, and drone jurisdiction accountability, can be achieved
   seamlessly for secure smart mobility via drone transportation systems.},

Title = {A Comprehensive Security Architecture for Information Management
   throughout the Lifecycle of IoT Products},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is expected to have an impact on business
   and the world at large in a way comparable to the Internet itself. An
   IoT product is a physical product with an associated virtual counterpart
   connected to the internet with computational as well as communication
   capabilities. The possibility to collect information from
   internet-connected products and sensors gives unprecedented
   possibilities to improve and optimize product use and maintenance.
   Virtual counterpart and digital twin (DT) concepts have been proposed as
   a solution for providing the necessary information management throughout
   the whole product lifecycle, which we here call product lifecycle
   information management (PLIM). Security in these systems is imperative
   due to the multiple ways in which opponents can attack the system during
   the whole lifecycle of an IoT product. To address this need, the current
   study proposes a security architecture for the IoT, taking into
   particular consideration the requirements of PLIM. The security
   architecture has been designed for the Open Messaging Interface (O-MI)
   and Open Data Format (O-DF) standards for the IoT and product lifecycle
   management (PLM) but it is also applicable to other IoT and PLIM
   architectures. The proposed security architecture is capable of
   hindering unauthorized access to information and restricts access levels
   based on user roles and permissions. Based on our findings, the proposed
   security architecture is the first security model for PLIM to integrate
   and coordinate the IoT ecosystem, by dividing the security approaches
   into two domains: user client and product domain. The security
   architecture has been deployed in smart city use cases in three
   different European cities, Helsinki, Lyon, and Brussels, to validate the
   security metrics in the proposed approach. Our analysis shows that the
   proposed security architecture can easily integrate the security
   requirements of both clients and products providing solutions for them
   as demonstrated in the implemented use cases.},

Abstract = {Microgrids (MG) is originally designed to make Smart Grids more
   energy-efficient and reliable. The MG repre-sents a complex
   cyber-physical system whose functioning is driven by the interaction of
   physical actions and computational elements, making it vulnerable to
   many forms of malicious cyber-attack. This study considers the effect of
   data integrity attack (DIA) on the performance of hybrid MGs, an
   important cyber threat to microgrids (MGs). Further, this paper develops
   a new process using sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) for detecting
   DIA on renewable energy resources and improving the security of
   information in hybrid MGs. By using a binary sample generated from the
   suggested approach, an analysis statistic is computed and afterward
   compared to 2 thresholds for deciding between the 3 options. On the
   measured energy production of renewable energy sources such as wind
   turbines, DIAs of various severity levels have been conducted for
   assessing the impact of DIAs on hybrid MG security. A standard IEEE test
   system has been used to evaluate the efficiency of the suggested
   process.},

Title = {Combined Anomaly Detection Framework for Digital Twins of Water
   Treatment Facilities},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},

Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital twins of cyber-physical systems with automated process control
   systems using programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are increasingly
   popular nowadays. At the same time, cyber-physical security is also a
   growing concern with system connectivity. This study develops a combined
   anomaly detection framework (CADF) against various types of security
   attacks on the digital twin of process control in water treatment
   facilities. CADF utilizes the PLC-based whitelist system to detect
   anomalies that target the actuators and the deep learning approach of
   natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) and probabilistic assessment to
   detect anomalies that target the sensors. The effectiveness of CADF is
   verified using a physical facility for water treatment with membrane
   processes called the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system in the
   Singapore University of Technology and Design. Various attack scenarios
   are tested in SWaT by falsifying the reported values of sensors and
   actuators in the digital twin process. These scenarios include both
   trivial attacks, which are commonly studied, as well as non-trivial
   (i.e., sophisticated) attacks, which are rarely reported. The results
   show that CADF performs very well with good detection accuracy in all
   scenarios, and particularly, it is able to detect all sophisticated
   attacks while ongoing before they can induce damage to the water
   treatment facility. CADF can be further extended to other cyber-physical
   systems in the future.},

Abstract = {A vision of the digital twins of the subsea pipelines is provided in
   this paper, with a coverage of the current applications and the
   challenges of the digital twins in the design, construction, service
   life, and assessments of life extension. Digital twins are described as
   a paradigm combining multi-physics modelling with data-driven analytics,
   which are used to mirror the life of its corresponding twin. Realistic
   virtual models of structural systems are shown to bridge the gap between
   design and construction and to mirror the real and virtual worlds.
   Challenges in properly using the new tools and how to create accurate
   digital twins considering data acquired during the construction phase
   are discussed. The key opportunities for improved integrity management
   using the digital twin are data contextualization, standardization,
   automated anomaly detection, and learning through sharing. The
   collection, interpretation and sharing of data, and cyber-security are
   identified as some of the main challenges.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the secure vehicle communications in
   cybertwin-enabled integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, where the
   digital twins (DTs) in the cybertwin space reflects the physical
   entities (i.e., satellite, terrestrial base station (BS), and vehicles).
   Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different
   satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links,
   it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and
   terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the
   information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information
   sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design
   by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be
   conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback
   information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel
   interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the
   implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated
   satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of
   maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the
   terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve
   such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization
   approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite
   programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the
   tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is
   also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out
   and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Abstract = {To address the current security challenges, Digital Twin (DT) models and
   strategies are to be applied to improve security, privacy, and safety in
   intelligent transportation systems. However, the existing algorithm was
   failed to address the security and privacy issues for data between the
   vehicles. To enhance the security of data transmission, a novel Probit
   Regressive Davis Mayer Kupyna Cryptographic Hash Blockchain (PRDMKCHB)
   technique is proposed. Initially, the source vehicle finds the nearest
   vehicle to transmit the data based on the trust value using the probit
   regression function. After finding the neighboring nodes, the Blockchain
   is constructed to improve the security of data transmission from the
   source to the destination. The Blockchain uses the Kupyna Cryptography
   to generate the hash value for each data. Davis Mayer compression
   function is to improve the security of data delivery and to minimize
   packet loss. The comprehensive simulation is carried out to validate the
   performance of the proposed PRDMKCHB technique and existing Blockchain
   technology in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet loss rate, and
   execution time. Simulation results show the performance improvement of
   the proposed PRDMKCHB technique compared to the previous Blockchain
   technology in terms of higher packet delivery ratio, minimum packet
   loss, and execution time with respect to the number of data packets.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an Augmented Reality software suite aiming at
   supporting the operator's interaction with flexible mobile robot
   workers. The developed AR suite, integrated with the shopfloor's Digital
   Twin, provides the operators' a) virtual interfaces to easily program

   status, c) safety awareness by superimposing the active safety zones
   around the robots and d) instructions for recovering the system from
   unexpected events. The application's purpose is to simplify and
   accelerate the industrial manufacturing process by introducing an easy
   and intuitive way of interaction with the hardware, without requiring
   special programming skills or long training from the human operators.
   The proposed software is developed for the Microsoft's HoloLens Mixed
   Reality Headset 2, integrated with Robotic Operation System (ROS), and
   it has been tested in a case study inspired from the automotive

Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 10},
Abstract = {This review article provides an overview of the potential of the
   Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to revolutionize industrial
   automation. The IIoT is the Internet of Things (IoT) but in an
   industrial context, i.e., IIoT is used more to connect machines and
   devices in industrial environments. The IIoT has the potential to
   benefit from advances in artificial intelligence, particularly machine
   learning and deep learning, to increase efficiency and productivity and
   reduce overhead costs. We provide an overview of the supervisory control
   and data acquisition system, a definition of IIoT, and how IIoT can
   offer industry greater potential for system integration to improve
   automation and optimization. In addition, five of the major IIoT
   protocols are discussed, namely, message queue telemetry transport,
   advanced messaging queuing protocol, constrained application protocol,
   data distribution service, and open platform communication unified
   architecture. We then identified key IIoT improvements for industrial
   automation. These are; efficient and low-cost systems, digital twin,
   machine failure prediction, real-time remote monitoring, and security.
   We then discussed the key research in the literature for each category.
   We presented some public IIoT datasets so that researchers can use them
   to develop new learning models to improve the security of IIoT systems.
   Finally, we discussed some of the limitations, recommendations, and
   future perspectives for developing IIoT-enabled systems.},

Abstract = {Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) in Germany-or Industrial Internet 4.0, as it is
   called internationally-are key initiatives in order to bring
   digitization into the automation domain by taking advantage of recent
   technology advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The core
   concept for I4.0 is the digital twin or asset administration shell
   (AAS), as it is called by the German Plattform Industrie 4.0 initiative.
   It shall provide a machine-readable description of I4.0 components,
   being available over the entire lifecycle and being used for various
   advanced use cases and services.
   Security has been an increasingly known and needed aspect during the
   last years and is a key requirement to make I4.0 actually happen. In a
   previous paper we proposed concepts for integrating authorization
   tightly into OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)-based information models.
   OPC UA is a new and promising industrial technology, which could be used
   to implement AAS concepts. The current proposals for AAS define
   necessary security concepts; however, there is no work explaining how
   these concepts can be implemented in OPC UA. This paper closes this gap
   by elaborating on realization alternatives in OPC UA. Furthermore, we
   extend our basic performance evaluation with more realistic data access

Abstract = {Digitalization shapes the ways of learning, working, and entertainment.
   The Internet, which enables us to connect and socialize is evolving to
   become the metaverse, a post-reality universe, enabling virtual life
   parallel to reality. In addition to gaming and entertainment, industry
   and academia have noticed the metaverse's benefits and possibilities.
   For industry, the metaverse is the enabler of the future digital
   workplace, and for academia, digital learning spaces enable realistic
   virtual training environments. A connection bridging the virtual world
   with physical production systems is required to enable digital
   workplaces and digital learning spaces. In this publication, extended
   reality-digital twin to real use cases are presented. The presented use
   cases utilize extended reality as high-level user interfaces and digital
   twins to create a bridge between virtual environments and robotic
   systems in industry, academia, and underwater exploration.},

   open research questions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Digital Twin was introduced over a decade ago, as an innovative
   all-encompassing tool, with perceived benefits including real-time
   monitoring, simulation, optimisation and accurate forecasting. However,
   the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin
   (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an
   increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and
   industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly
   available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and
   effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share
   lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT
   methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research
   and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current
   approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to
   infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current
   limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread
   implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that
   the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast
   evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g.
   DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem-and
   domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT
   performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving
   technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT)
   and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as
   real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and
   individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation
   gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread
   adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed
   in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps,
   this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its
   components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a
   concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation,
   autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to
   showcase the application of the conceptualisation. This work discusses
   the state-of-the-art in DT, addresses relevant and timely DT questions,
   and identifies novel research questions, thus contributing to a better
   understanding of the DT paradigm and advancing the theory and practice
   of DT and its allied technologies.},

Title = {Metrics development and modelling the mixed reality and digital twin
   adoption in the context of Industry 4.0},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the current technology acceptance
   model (TAM) in the field of mixed reality and digital twin (MRDT) and
   identify key factors affecting users' intentions to use MRDT. The
   factors are used as a set of key metrics for proposing a predictive
   model for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (MR) acceptance by users.
   This model is called the extended TAM for MRDT adoption in the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
   Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist philosophical lens was
   adopted to conduct an inductive systematic and bibliographical analysis
   of secondary data contained within published journal articles that
   focused upon MRDT acceptance modelling. The preferred reporting items
   for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach to
   meta-analysis were adopted to ensure all key investigations were
   included in the final database set. Quantity indicators such as path
   coefficients, factor ranking, Cronbach's alpha (a) and chi-square (b)
   test, coupled with content analysis, were used for examining the
   database constructed. The database included journal papers from 2010 to
   2020. Findings The extant literature revealed that the most commonly
   used constructs of the MRDT-TAM included: subjective norm; social
   influence; perceived ease of use (PEOU); perceived security; perceived
   enjoyment; satisfaction; perceived usefulness (PU); attitude; and
   behavioural intention (BI). Using these identified constructs, the
   general extended TAM for MRDT in the AECO industry is developed. Other
   important factors such as ``perceived immersion{''} could be added to
   the obtained model. Research limitations/implications The decision to
   utilise a new technology is difficult and high risk in the construction
   project context, due to the complexity of MRDT technologies and dynamic
   construction environment. The outcome of the decision may affect
   employee performance, project productivity and on-site safety. The
   extended acceptance model offers a set of factors that assist managers
   or practitioners in making effective decisions for utilising any type of
   MRDT technology. Practical implications Several constraints are apparent
   due to the limited investigation of MRDT evaluation matrices and
   empirical studies. For example, the research only covers technologies
   which have been reported in the literature, relating to virtual reality
   (VR), augmented reality (AR), MR, DT and sensors, so newer technologies
   may not be included. Moreover, the review process could span a longer
   time period and thus embrace a fuller spectrum of technology development
   in these different areas. Originality/value The research provides a
   theoretical model for measuring and evaluating MRDT acceptance at the
   individual level in the AECO context and signposts future research
   related to MRDT adoption in the AECO industry, as well as providing
   managerial guidance for progressive AECO professionals who seek to
   expand their use of MRDT in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). A
   set of key factors affecting MRDT acceptance is identified which will
   help innovators to improve their technology to achieve a wider
   acceptance.},

Abstract = {Recent attention is focused on interlinked (networked) hybrid connected
   microgrids (MGs) because of their technical and economic benefits over
   traditional ones. A system like that would connect the DC resources,
   such as solar energy, to DC busses and the AC resources, such as wind
   turbines, to AC busses. Therefore, the system's overall performance is
   remarkably improved. In addition, it is cost-effective compared to
   traditional grids since no power electronics are required to convert DC
   to AC. While a system like this has numerous benefits, it also has
   numerous challenges. System-level energy management (EM), for example,
   presents greater challenges because each change in the subsystem (DC/AC
   sections) may potentially alter the EM for the whole grid. Therefore,
   the present study develops the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for
   finding the optimum solution. Additionally, blockchain (BC) technology
   has been applied for increasing the security of power trading in hybrid
   MGs (HMGs). Stochastic load flow, according to a copula model, is used
   to create a realistic layout. According to the results, the suggested
   networked HMG-EM structure based on BC is demonstrated as being
   effective.},

Abstract = {A 3-D digital twin is commonly understood to be a virtual image of a
   physical element. Such virtual images can appear in various forms with
   very different characteristics and areas of application - and at very
   different prices. However, the high cost of creating 3-D models of
   as-built bridges and the lack of integration hinder the widespread
   adoption of a promising technology for monitoring and managing as-built
   bridges. The report explains how an evolution of gaming technology and
   the use of AI significantly reduces the cost and barriers to creating
   digital twins, creating a scalable solution for many application areas.
   In order for the 3-D digital twins to unfold the desired added value,
   the integration of the respective systems is of decisive importance in
   addition to simple handling. Aspects such as cloud, loT and ERP
   connection, questions of connectivity as well as security and privacy
   are central elements of a successful integration of 3-D digital dwins

Abstract = {Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are presented as an alternative and
   decentralized solutions with different application scales for problems
   addressed to urban expansion as water quality reduction and floods. The
   usage of control strategies and mathematical modeling techniques has
   shown promising results for optimizing hydraulic and water treatment
   processes. The Digital Twins (DT) as process integration technology are
   widely used in industry, and recently these technique usages in urban
   water systems are showing effective results in both management and
   planning. However, there is a lack of proper literature definition for
   DT applied to NbS, especially for stormwater and transboundary water
   security projects. Thus, this paper sought through a literature review
   to access the existing conceptual challenges and the DT definition as a
   framework, identify how the mathematical modeling reported in the
   literature can improve the DT development, and evaluate the potential
   benefits associated with the application of DT in NbS.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of cyber-physical systems is driving the growing need
   to establish links between these systems and virtual environments.
   Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and the
   imminent need to prevent manipulation of these devices in production
   environments make mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these
   physical objects in virtual environments necessary; this has been called
   a digital twin (DT). Conversley, cyberattacks are growing in all
   cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity is essential to the critical
   infrastructure of the smart grid. This work shows a small implementation
   of a DT system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment
   for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of DTs
   is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid, particularly in
   cybersecurity testing.},

Title = {Adoption of Blockchain Technology through Digital Twins in the
   Construction Industry 4.0: A PESTELS Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The key challenges of the building, engineering, construction,
   operations, and mining (BECOM) industries are the lack of trust,
   inefficiencies, and the fragmentation of the information value chain
   into vulnerable data silos throughout the lifecycle of projects. This
   paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of
   blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM
   industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information
   management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach
   is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges
   affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the
   technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS
   analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors
   affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a
   technological framework-namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle
   (DDTC)-that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and
   to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency,
   traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects'
   lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT
   with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things
   (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework
   offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around
   network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability,
   energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with
   IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects' lifecycles. The model also
   considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the
   circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key
   technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the
   DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works.
   Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and
   technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address
   the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry
   4.0.},

Title = {Security in modern manufacturing systems: integrating blockchain in
   artificial intelligence-assisted manufacturing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 27},
Abstract = {Process automation and mass customisation requirements of modern
   manufacturing systems are driven by artificial intelligence (AI). As AI
   derives decisions from data, securing the data against tampering is
   crucial to prevent ensuing operational risks. Additionally,
   manufacturing systems necessitate collaboration, transparency, and trust
   among participants while preserving a competitive advantage. Thus, we
   position blockchain, an enabler of transparent and secure operations, as
   a security solution for AI-assisted manufacturing systems. In this
   conceptual viewpoint paper, we present a framework to integrate
   blockchain in AI-assisted manufacturing systems. We highlight the
   special needs of manufacturing BCs over generic BCs. We delineate the
   ways in which manufacturing can be a beneficiary of the synergy between
   AI and BC. We discuss how BC and AI can accelerate early-phase product
   design, collaboration, and manufacturing processes and secure supply
   chains against counterfeit products and for ethical consumerism. Lastly,
   we identify the needs of modern manufacturing systems and cite a few
   examples of organisational failures to underscore the importance of
   security while delineating the significant challenges in adopting
   blockchain-based solutions in the manufacturing industry.},

Title = {Supervision System 4.0 for a Road Tanker Washing Robot Manipulator},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The washing of road tankers is currently still a manual process that
   requires an operator to place the washing head into the tanks. To
   increase productivity and operator safety, it is essential to implement
   automated systems with Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) capabilities.
   On the other hand, the industry 4.0 paradigm promotes the use of
   collaborative systems that integrate with the other organization's
   processes. Realizing this new vision requires Supervision, Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with FDI modules that integrate with
   collaborative systems and promote the digitalization of companies. This
   paper proposes a SCADA system for a new road tanker washing robot, aimed
   at integrating all systems and communication networks of the
   organization and future FDI modules. To this end, this paper proposes a
   communication architecture based on open protocols and a common database
   to connect SCADA to the lower and higher levels of automation.
   Furthermore, this paper describes the various aspects of SCADA system
   development, from synoptic design to validation. To support the
   development of the SCADA system, a Digital Twin (DT) of the road tanker
   washing robot was used, allowing to test and validate its functionality
   through this virtual prototype. The results show that the proposed SCADA
   system and underlying information architecture are suitable for
   supervision of a robotized wash operation and that the use of a Digital
   Twin facilitates SCADA system design and validation.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {For the next coming years, metaverse, digital twin and autonomous
   vehicle applications are the leading technologies for many complex
   applications hitherto inaccessible such as health and life sciences,
   smart home, smart agriculture, smart city, smart car and logistics,
   Industry 4.0, entertainment (video game) and social media applications,
   due to recent tremendous developments in process modeling,
   supercomputing, cloud data analytics (deep learning, etc.),
   communication network and AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies. AIoT/IIoT/IoT is a
   crucial research field because it provides the essential data to fuel
   metaverse, digital twin, real-time Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicle
   applications. However, the science of AIoT is inherently
   multidisciplinary, and therefore, it is difficult for readers to
   understand its evolution and impacts. Our main contribution in this
   article is to analyze and highlight the trends and challenges of the
   AIoT technology ecosystem including core hardware (MCU, MEMS/NEMS
   sensors and wireless access medium), core software (operating system and
   protocol communication stack) and middleware (deep learning on a
   microcontroller: TinyML). Two low-powered AI technologies emerge: TinyML
   and neuromorphic computing, but only one AIoT/IIoT/IoT device
   implementation using TinyML dedicated to strawberry disease detection as
   a case study. So far, despite the very rapid progress of AIoT/IIoT/IoT
   technologies, several challenges remain to be overcome such as safety,
   security, latency, interoperability and reliability of sensor data,
   which are essential characteristics to meet the requirements of
   metaverse, digital twin, autonomous vehicle and Industry 4.0.

Abstract = {Nowadays, with the widespread industrial use of digital data and
   relative maturity of the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics
   (artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and data
   visualization), we can design, customize, and implement plenty of
   systems which once were unimaginable. A combination of the mentioned
   fields leads to the emergence of new technology, i.e., Digital Twins
   (DT). The potentials of DT in different fields have changed the
   perspective of most academia/industry leaders around the world. The
   fundamental concept of DT lies in developing the living and intelligent
   model which faithfully mimics the physical system during the lifetime of
   the physical ones. Indeed, by co-evolving with the physical system, the
   DT can precisely explore the design flaws of the virtual environment and
   make quick changes, which will ameliorate the design, prevent tedious
   confirmation and experiments. In review research, the principle
   definitions, architecture, characteristics of DT as well as the enabling
   key technologies of this context are briefly provided; after that, the
   ranges of applications of DT in manufacturing and industry will be
   presented. In particular, the evaluation details and challenges related
   to the zero-emission ships along with its DT model, which recently have
   been getting attention in academia, industry, and government, have been
   discussed. Eventually, the standardized application of blockchain
   technology, regarded as distributed ledger technology (DLT), will be
   introduced as a practical solution for data storage, data access, data
   sharing, data security, and data integrity in the DT.},

Abstract = {Manufacturing systems based on Industry 4.0 concepts provide a greater
   availability of data and have modular characteristics enabling frequent
   changes. This raises the need for new security engineering concepts that
   cover the increasing complexity and frequency of mandatory security risk
   assessments. In contrast, the current standardization landscape used for
   the assessment of these systems only offers abstract, static, manual,
   and resource-intensive procedures. Therefore, this work proposes a
   method that further specifies the IEC 62443 aiming to automate the
   security risk assessments in such a way that manual efforts can be
   reduced and a consistent quality can be achieved. The methodology is
   presented using network segmentation as a guiding example and consists
   of four main steps: Information collection based on a process analysis,
   information formalisation with a semi-formal model, information usage
   applying first order logic to extract expert knowledge, and information
   access using the concept of the digital twin. In addition, the
   applicability of the IEC 62443 standard to the risk assessment of
   modular manufacturing systems is evaluated.},

Title = {Progress and Prospective in the Development of Stored Grain Ecosystems
   in China: From Composition, Structure, and Smart Construction to Wisdom
   Methodology},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Food security is intrinsically linked to maintaining optimal physical
   health and promoting active lifestyles. Stored Grain Ecosystems (SGEs)
   are complex systems comprising a range of grains, microorganisms, and
   environmental elements. To ensure sustainable grain storage and promote
   food-friendly SGEs, careful regulation and monitoring of these factors
   are vital. This review traces the evolution of the Eco-concept of stored
   grain in China, focusing on micro- and macro-structural composition, the
   Multi-field/Re-coupling structure, and Smart Construction of SGEs, while
   introducing the four development lines and Wisdom Methodology of SGEs.
   The current status and challenges of SGEs in China are also discussed.
   The Eco-concept of stored grain in China has progressed through the
   initial exploration period, formation and practice periods, and has now
   entered its fourth stage, marked by a shift to include interactions of
   multiple biological fields. This evolution extends beyond the
   traditional binary relationship and offers emerging technologies greater
   scope for scientific and intelligent theoretical analysis of grain
   storage practices. The Wisdom Methodology employs a multifaceted,
   Mechanism and Data-driven approach, incorporating four driving methods,
   and is now widely recognized as a leading strategy for researching Smart
   Grain Systems. Digital Twin technology enables precise simulations and
   mappings of real-world SGEs in a virtual environment, supporting
   accurate assessments and early warnings for issues concerning grain
   conditions. Driven by Mechanism and Data, Digital Twin solutions are a
   pioneering trend and emerging hotspot with vast potential for enhancing
   the intelligence and wisdom of future grain storage processes. Overall,
   this review provides valuable guidance to practitioners for advancing
   high-quality Smart Grain Systems, enhancing sustainable and intelligent
   grain storage practices.},

Title = {A blockchain-based system to enhance aircraft parts traceability and
   trackability for inventory management},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {179},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Aircraft spare parts inventory management (ASPM) has played a critical
   role in tracing and tracking spare parts as any related maintenance or
   movement shall be recorded. Traceability and trackability of data ensure
   the compliance of airworthiness requirements. The International Air
   Transport Association (IATA) has strongly emphasised the significance of
   quality traceability data throughout the aircraft part's life cycle,
   leading to enhanced inventory control accuracy, reduced maintenance
   error, and effective decision-making processes. However, with the rapid
   increase of spare parts types, the complexity of aircraft parts
   multi-stage supply chains leads to inefficient tracing and tracking
   operations with unsatisfactory traceability data quality and information
   security. This paper proposed a blockchain-based system that provided a
   managerial platform for accurate recording of spare parts traceability
   data with organisational consensus and validation using Hyperledger
   Fabric and Hyperledger Composer. A data model has been determined based
   on the existing ASPM, enabling information integrity during transaction
   operations. The channel mechanism has yielded a trustful data sharing
   platform between each contracting organisation for logistics and
   operational arrangements, which has enhanced information visibility and
   security. The blockchain-based system, executed under a decentralised
   ledger mechanism, shall improve the quality of traceability data and
   reliable information sharing within the spare parts supply chain. The
   enhanced blockchain-based inventory management system can establish the
   digital twin of aviation as part of Industry 4.0 in the future.},

Title = {Digitally twinned additive manufacturing: Detecting flaws in laser
   powder bed fusion by combining thermal simulations with in-situ meltpool
   sensor data},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {211},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The goal of this research is the in-situ detection of flaw formation in
   metal parts made using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive
   manufacturing process. This is an important area of research, because,
   despite the considerable cost and time savings achieved,
   precision-driven industries, such as aerospace and biomedical, are
   reticent in using LPBF to make safety-critical parts due to tendency of
   the process to create flaws. Another emerging concern in LPBF, and
   additive manufacturing in general, is related to cyber security -
   malicious actors may tamper with the process or plant flaws inside a
   part to compromise its performance. Accordingly, the objective of this
   work is to develop and apply a physics and data integrated strategy for
   online monitoring and detection of flaw formation in LPBF parts. The
   approach used to realize this objective is based on combining (twinning)
   in-situ meltpool temperature measurements with a graph theory-based
   thermal simulation model that rapidly predicts the temperature
   distribution in the part (thermal history). The novelty of the approach
   is that the temperature distribution predictions provided by the
   computational thermal model were updated layer-by-layer with in-situ
   meltpool temperature measurements. This digital twin approach is applied
   to detect flaw formation in stainless steel (316L) impeller-shaped parts
   made using a commercial LPBF system. Four such impellers are produced
   emulating three pathways of flaw formation in LPBF parts, these are:
   changes in the processing parameters (process drifts); machine-related
   malfunctions (lens delamination), and deliberate tampering with the
   process to plant flaws inside the part (cyber intrusions). The severity
   and nature of the resulting flaws, such as porosity and microstructure
   heterogeneity, are characterized ex-situ using X-ray computed
   tomography, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and electron
   backscatter diffraction. The digital twin approach is shown to be
   effective for detection of the three types of flaw formation causes
   studied in this work. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {In recent years, potentially disruptive identity-related topics emerged,
   such as digital twin technology for product lifecycle management or
   self-sovereign identity (SSI) for sovereign data control. In this study,
   we identify research streams and emerging trends in academic research on

   articles and their 44,412 references. We derive seven distinct research
   streams and their interrelations by means of co-citation analysis. We
   name the seven research streams: i) Digital twin technology for smart
   manufacturing and industrial health monitoring, ii) identity-based
   signcryption schemes, iii) distributed networks and user privacy, iv)
   user authentication in wireless sensor networks, v) attribute-based
   encryption schemes, vi) secure data exchange in the Internet of Things
   and vii) blockchain and smart contracts for secure data management. Each
   stream's high-impact publications and its development over time are
   reviewed and the interrelation between publications and streams are
   visualized. In addition, we extract directions for future research from
   the field's most influential publications. The results offer a

Title = {A detailed design for a radioactive waste safety management system using
   ICT technologies},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {149},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A Radioactive Waste Information Management System (RAWINGS) currently in
   operation mainly manages the inventory and history of the operating
   waste. The system has the disadvantages of the entered information
   needing to be transferred manually from the site to the system,
   information getting incorrectly entered during the process or
   information going missing. Recently, the Nuclear Safety and Security
   Commission (NSSC) and Korea Radioactive Waste Agency (KORAD) called for
   the development of a digital system that can show information
   transparently in real-time regarding the preliminary inspections of
   RAdioactive Waste (RAW) and the assessment of its suitability for
   disposal before the radioactive waste is delivered to the disposal site.
   A Digital Twin (DT) system is being developed for the safety management
   of radioactive waste to address the problems that these systems have and
   meet the needs of disposal operators. This paper introduces the DT
   technology that uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology enabling users to
   check the contents of small-packaged wastes in radioactive waste drums
   without opening them, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor technology that
   checks the status of the drums in the radioactive waste storage and the
   RAWINGS system. Based on the performance of a prototype Digital Twin
   consisting of three modules (AR, IoT and RAWINGS), the augmented reality
   enables users to see the shape information and filling rate of
   small-packaged wastes in the radioactive waste drums and includes Quick
   Response (QR) code management. The basic data of the radioactive waste
   used in the augmented reality, as well as small packaged wastes and
   repackaged drums, were processed in conjunction with RAWINGS. In
   addition, real-time monitoring of radioactive waste drums loaded in the
   designated space (Y zone: an area where combustible waste is loaded
   within radioactive waste storage and TEST area: a section where drums
   scheduled to be transported to the disposal site are loaded) of the
   radioactive waste storage was possible by transmitting IoT sensor
   signals attached to the drum to the digital twin. Currently, augmented
   reality has an important role in enhancing the visibility and
   intuitiveness of radioactive waste information for radioactive waste
   managers and workers by overlapping digital information about
   radioactive waste storage. Due to the nature of radioactive waste, it is
   difficult to know what waste is inside the enclosed drum. However, the
   results of this study confirmed that waste contained in radioactive
   waste drums can be identified in real time in the Digital Twin rather
   than in the radioactive waste storage. This technology will be useful in
   determining the conformity of the radioactive waste acceptance criteria
   required by KORAD before the delivery of radioactive waste drums to
   disposal sites.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of digital technology is reshaping the
   architecture of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The
   traditional architecture cannot process vast amounts of data exchanges
   and provide entities with trust. The future IIoT is expected to be a
   decentralized architecture in which blockchain and digital twin-driven
   IIoT can enable trusted data exchanges. However, this architecture
   cannot obtain huge amounts of external real-time data and isolated data.
   Moreover, it cannot handle complex industrial computing tasks.
   Therefore, we combine oracle with decentralized learning to propose a
   novel IIoT-oriented digital twin architecture. We also propose an
   effective decentralized collaboration mechanism to support external data
   and resources exchanges. Moreover, we propose a novel computing
   collaboration mechanism to expand the learning capabilities of the
   industrial ecology. Experiments show that our proposed paradigm has less
   processing time, a more stable process, and better learning ability
   compared to other paradigms.},

Title = {Analysis of safety and security challenges and opportunities related to
   cyber-physical systems},
Journal = {PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {384-413},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A cyber-physical system (CPS) is an interconnected physical system that
   can be monitored, controlled, and operated remotely. A systems-based
   analysis of CPS is critical for enhancing operational safety and
   security. Such analysis is particularly important in light of the
   evolving Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) which is largely
   driven by CPS, Internet of Things (IoT), algorithmic systems,
   automation, and smart manufacturing. As a result of industries' and
   societies' growing dependence on CPSs, their safe and secure
   applications need to be scrutinized to avoid any threats or harm to
   processes and human lives. In order to achieve this target, the current
   work analyzes the literature to investigate challenges and opportunities
   present in the CPSs. The analysis at-tempts to answer the following
   Research Questions (RQs): (RQ1) What are the prominent trends in the
   field of safety and security of CPSs? (RQ2) What are the opportunities
   in Industry 4.0 technologies related to safety? (RQ3) What
   characteristics of CPSs are likely to cause safety and security issues?
   (RQ4) What are the emerging safety and security issues introduced by
   CPSs? (RQ5) How were these issues addressed in the literature? CPSs can
   address some traditional safety issues due to characteristics like high
   efficiency and control. However, a CPS is challenged by heterogeneity,
   dependencies, complexity, unattended nature, increased machine
   intelligence, autonomous reconfiguration, and uncertainties. Safety and
   security challenges include opaque system failure, complex
   socio-technical system, human-machine interface, cyber-physical attacks,
   unsecured remote configu-ration, lack of standards, and resilience. The
   paper is structured under the following key headings: bibliometric
   results, opportunities from Industry 4.0 technologies, issues introduced
   by Industry 4.0 technologies, literature proposed solutions, and
   research challenges. Based on the assessment of about 900 relevant
   publications extracted from two databases (Web of Science (WoS) Core
   Collection and Engineering village (EV)), the docu-ments were
   categorized into eight major divisions: (i) Safety Opportunities, (ii)
   Hazardous Characteristics, (iii) Fault Occurrence, (iv) Cyber-physical
   attacks, (v) Human factors, (vi) occupational Health and safety, (vii)
   standards, and (viii) Reliability and resiliency. Proactive strategies
   were classified under four options: identifi-cation, evaluation,
   prevention, and management. The paper also raises some research needs
   and unanswered questions that require further analysis to address how
   security and safety mechanisms can introduce more complexity in the
   system that can lead to new risks. The paper concludes by emphasizing
   digital process safety as part of the engineering curriculum to address
   the process industry's need for digital solutions and to make process
   safety learning a conscious choice.},

Abstract = {In this article, we utilize Digital Twins (DT) with edge networks using
   blockchain technology for reliable real-time data processing and provide
   a secure, scalable solution to bridge the gap between physical edge
   networks and digital systems. Then, we suggest a Federated Learning (FL)
   framework for collaborative computing that runs on a blockchain and is
   powered by the DT edge network. This framework increases data privacy
   while enhancing system security and reliability. The provision of
   sustainable Resource Allocation (RA) and ensure real-time
   data-processing interaction between Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
   edge servers depends on a balance between system latency and Energy
   Consumption (EC) based on the proposed DT-empowered Deep Reinforcement
   Learning (Deep-RL) agent. The Deep-RL agent evaluates the performance
   action based on RA actions in DT to distribute its bandwidth resources
   to IoT devices based on iteration and the actions taken to generate the
   best policy and enhance learning efficiency at every step. The
   simulation results show that the proposed Deep-RL-agent-based DT is able
   to exploit the best policy, select 47.5\% of computing activities that
   are to be carried out locally with 1 MHz bandwidth and minimize the
   weighted cost of the transmission policy of edge-computing strategies.},

Title = {Blockchain-Driven Image Encryption Process with Arithmetic Optimization
   Algorithm for Security in Emerging Virtual Environments},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The real world is bounded by people, hospitals, industries, buildings,
   businesses, vehicles, cognitive cities, and billions of devices that
   offer various services and interact with the world. Recent technologies,
   including AR, VR, XR, and the digital twin concept, provide advanced
   solutions to create a new virtual world. Due to the ongoing development
   of information communication technologies and broadcast channels, data
   security has become a major concern. Blockchain (BC) technology is an
   open, decentralized, and transparent distributed database that can be
   maintained by the group. BC's major features are high credibility,
   decentralization, transparency, versatility, autonomy, traceability,
   anonymity, intelligence, reward mechanisms, and irreversibility. This
   study presents a blockchain-driven image encryption technique using
   arithmetic optimization with a fractional-order Lorenz system
   (BDIE-AOFOLS). The BDIE-AOFOLS technique uses the FOLS method, which
   integrates the Arnold map, tent map, and fractional Lorenz system.
   Besides this, an arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) was carried out
   for the optimum key generation process to achieve the maximum PSNR
   value. The design of an AOA-based optimal generation of keys for the
   FOLS technique determines the novelty of the current work. Moreover, the
   cryptographical pixel values of the images can be stored securely in the
   BC, guaranteeing image security. We compared the outcomes of the
   proposed BDIE-AOFOLS technique against benchmark color images. The
   comparative analysis demonstrated the improved security efficiency of
   the BDIE-AOFOLS technique over other approaches, with a mean square
   error of 0.0430 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 61.80 dB.},

Abstract = {Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for
   manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However,
   most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of
   Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor
   flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to
   support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article
   combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel
   manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the
   configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then,
   hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are
   designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of
   IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is
   presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT
   with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the
   autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an
   MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the
   proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment
   demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and
   decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive
   throughput and latency performance.},

Title = {Digital Twins in the Construction Industry: A Comprehensive Review of
   Current Implementations, Enabling Technologies, and Future Directions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive understanding of current digital
   twin (DT) implementations in the construction industry, along with
   providing an overview of technologies enabling the operation of DTs in
   the industry. To this end, 145 publications were identified using a
   systematic literature review. The results revealed eight key areas of DT
   implementation including (i) virtual design, (ii) project planning and
   management, (iii) asset management and maintenance, (iv) safety
   management, (v) energy efficiency and sustainability, (vi) quality
   control and management, (vii) supply chain management and logistics, and
   (viii) structural health monitoring. The findings demonstrate that DT
   technology has the capacity to revolutionise the construction industry
   across these areas, enabling optimised designs, improved collaboration,
   real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, enhanced safety practices,
   energy performance optimisation, quality inspections, efficient supply
   chain management, and proactive maintenance. This study also identified
   several challenges that hinder the widespread implementation of DT in
   construction, including (i) data integration and interoperability, (ii)
   data accuracy and completeness, (iii) scalability and complexity, (iv)
   privacy and security, and (v) standards and governance. To address these
   challenges, this paper recommends prioritising standardised data
   formats, protocols, and APIs for seamless collaboration, exploring
   semantic data modelling and ontologies for data integration,
   implementing validation processes and robust data governance for
   accuracy and completeness, harnessing high-performance computing and
   advanced modelling techniques for scalability and complexity,
   establishing comprehensive data protection and access controls for
   privacy and security, and developing widely accepted standards and
   governance frameworks with industry-wide collaboration. By addressing
   these challenges, the construction industry can unlock the full
   potential of DT technology, thus enhancing safety, reliability, and
   efficiency in construction projects.},

Title = {Cyber-Physical System Framework for Measurement and Analysis of Physical
   Activities},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Several recent studies in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) focus on
   monitoring human movement and capturing data for further processing and
   analysis. However, there is a lack of studies that address the
   configurability and modularity of these systems, which is important for
   designing customized systems with customized devices. We propose a
   solution to solve this through a modular framework that automatically
   recognizes and configures new devices and provides real-time data
   wirelessly. The proposed framework creates a Digital Twin of the
   physical device and mirrors its attributes and sensory information into
   the cyber world so they can be used in real-time and post-routine
   analysis. As a proof of concept, a configurable CPS model for physical
   activities monitoring is designed and implemented. The designed gait
   monitoring and analysis system delivers spatiotemporal data from
   multiple multi-sensory devices to a central data handling and backup
   cloud server over conventional IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi. An experiment involving
   a young athlete examined whether or not the CPS components would
   recognize each other over foreign networks and communicate accurate
   information.},

Abstract = {The current study considers numerous renewable energy resources,

   electric vehicles (PHEV) in order to propose a reliable large-scale

   grid-connected operations of renewable hybrid AC-DC microgrids (MGs).
   The framework uses a bat optimization algorithm (BOA) for minimizing the
   operating costs of the network and in addition introduces an intrusion
   detection system (IDS) according to the sequential hypothesis testing
   (SHT) method for detecting identity-enabled cyber-attacks (i.e
   classification of Sybil attacks, masquerading attacks) on the
   wireless-enabled advanced metering infrastructures (AMI). The suggested
   IDS uses the received signal strength (RSS) amount for distinguishing
   various signal resources and detecting cyberattacks. An IEEE 33-bus
   testing system has been used to construct a real-time hybrid MG in order
   to determine the reliability and efficiency of the suggested framework.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the process of improving health care in
   real-time experimental settings. Despite the fact that there are
   numerous solutions for health-care issues, no remote solution has been
   devised. As a result, a novel model has been devised in the suggested
   technique, in which all hospital administration processes are simplified
   through the use of a virtual representation digital twin process. When
   such technologies are used, a discrete protocol is followed, resulting
   in the identification and integration of a security model based on
   demand movement. A machine learning discriminant analysis has been
   combined with the process of digital twin functions efficiently based on
   input signals and state vectors. The cohesive model is put to the test
   in four case studies, including delay monitoring, predictive score
   analysis, communication units, and battery charge rate, with all case
   study outcomes proving to be more effective than existing systems by an
   average of 74\%.},

Abstract = {In this era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), edge computing has
   emerged as the critical enabling technology to solve a series of issues
   caused by an increasing amount of interconnected devices and large-scale
   data transmission. However, the deficiencies of edge computing paradigm
   are gradually being magnified in the context of IoE, especially in terms
   of service migration, security and privacy preservation, and deployment
   issues of edge node. These issues can not be well addressed by
   conventional approaches. Thanks to the rapid development of upcoming
   technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and
   microservices, novel and more effective solutions have emerged and been
   applied to solve existing challenges. In addition, edge computing can be
   deeply integrated with technologies in other domains (e.g., AI,
   blockchain, 6G, and digital twin) through interdisciplinary intersection
   and practice, releasing the potential for mutual benefit. These
   promising integrations need to be further explored and researched. In
   addition, edge computing provides strong support in applications
   scenarios, such as remote working, new physical retail industries, and
   digital advertising, which has greatly changed the way we live, work,
   and study. In this article, we present an up-to-date survey of the edge
   computing research. In addition to introducing the definition, model,
   and characteristics of edge computing, we discuss a set of key issues in
   edge computing and novel solutions supported by emerging technologies in
   IoE era. Furthermore, we explore the potential and promising trends from
   the perspective of technology integration. Finally, new application
   scenarios and the final form of edge computing are discussed.},

Abstract = {The last decade saw the emergence of highly autonomous, flexible,
   re-configurable Cyber-Physical Systems. Research in this domain has been
   enhanced by the use of high-fidelity simulations, including Digital
   Twins, which are virtual representations connected to real assets.
   Digital Twins have been used for process supervision, prediction, or
   interaction with physical assets. Interaction with Digital Twins is
   enhanced by Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, and Industry
   5.0-focused research is evolving with the involvement of the human
   aspect in Digital Twins. This paper aims to review recent research on
   Human-Centric Digital Twins (HCDTs) and their enabling technologies. A
   systematic literature review is performed using the VOSviewer keyword
   mapping technique. Current technologies such as motion sensors,
   biological sensors, computational intelligence, simulation, and
   visualization tools are studied for the development of HCDTs in
   promising application areas. Domain-specific frameworks and guidelines
   are formed for different HCDT applications that highlight the workflow
   and desired outcomes, such as the training of AI models, the
   optimization of ergonomics, the security policy, task allocation, etc. A
   guideline and comparative analysis for the effective development of
   HCDTs are created based on the criteria of Machine Learning
   requirements, sensors, interfaces, and Human Digital Twin inputs.},

   Directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The construction industry has been criticized for low productivity, lack
   of collaboration and information sharing, poor contract administration,
   and the like due to its decentralized and fragmented structure as well
   as sequential and chain-resembling nature. Recently, blockchain
   technology and its benefits have received wide attention and interest.
   This research synthesizes the research trends and needs of this growing
   area by means of a bibliometric-qualitative review method. Scopus and
   Web of Science were selected as the literature databases to retrieve
   relevant academic publications. Through a systematic literature search
   and screening, 181 related articles were identified for bibliometric
   analysis, and 149 publications were critically discussed in a
   qualitative review. The bibliometric results indicated the recent
   research regarding blockchain in construction is primarily directed into
   several clusters, such as ``smart contract,{''} ``Building Information
   Modeling (BIM),{''} ``supply chain management,{''} ``construction
   contract,{''} ``construction and project management,{''} ``digital
   twin,{''} and ``smart city.{''} These clusters were further synthesized
   for a qualitative review revealing deep insight into research challenges
   and gaps. Both quantitative and qualitative review results were then
   mapped to the future directions. It was noted that future research needs
   to focus on (1) quantifying the cost-benefits of the blockchain
   applications in construction, e.g., return on investment, practitioners
   training, and improving industry readiness, (2) integration of
   blockchain with different project delivery systems, and (3) technology
   fusion with blockchain for construction management.},

Title = {Cyber-Physical Cloud Battery Management Systems: Review of Security
   Aspects},
Journal = {BATTERIES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Battery management systems (BMSs) are critical to ensure the efficiency
   and safety of high-power battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in
   vehicular and stationary applications. Recently, the proliferation of
   battery big data and cloud computing advancements has led to the
   development of a new generation of BMSs, named Cloud BMS (CBMS), aiming
   to improve the performance and safety of BESSs. The CBMS is a
   cyber-physical system with connectivity between the physical BMS and a
   cloud-based virtual BMS, which is realized through a communication
   channel such as Internet of Things. Compared to the traditional BMS, the
   CBMS offers significantly higher computational resources, leveraging the
   implementation of advanced digital twin models and best-in-class
   algorithms in the BMS software, which will provide superior
   performances. However, as for any other CPS, the CBMS creates
   vulnerabilities against cyberattacks and if not properly secured, could
   end up damaging the BESS and/or causing dangerous, expensive, and
   life-threatening situations. Cybersecurity of the CBMSs has thus become
   a trending topic and several works have been published in this area in
   recent years. This paper conducts a scoping review to address different
   topics related to BMS cybersecurity. The CBMS architecture is presented,
   and the potential cyberattack surfaces are identified. Different
   possible attack scenarios, including attack points, attack types, and
   their impact at the component level (BMS and BESS) and system level
   (vehicle or grid), are discussed. In addition, the paper provides a
   review of potential countermeasures to protect the CBMS against
   cyberattacks. The paper also includes a review of the applicable
   standards and regulations that relate to this trending topic. Finally,
   based on the reviewed gaps, potential future research domains on BMS
   cybersecurity topics are identified and presented at the end of the
   paper.},

Title = {Safe and secure platooning of Automated Guided Vehicles in Industry 4.0},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are widely used for materials
   transportation. Operating them in a platooned manner has the potential
   to improve safety, security and efficiency, control overall traffic flow
   and reduce resource usage. However, the published studies on platooning
   focus mainly on the design of technical solutions in the context of
   automotive domain. In this paper we focus on a largely unexplored theme
   of platooning in production sites transformed to the Industry 4.0, with
   the aim of providing safety and security assurances. We present an
   overall approach for a fault- and threat tolerant platooning for
   materials transportation in production environments. Our functional use
   cases include the platoon control for collision avoidance, data
   acquisition and processing by considering range, and connectivity with
   fog and cloud levels. To perform the safety and security analyses, the
   Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and Threat and Operability (THROP)
   techniques are used. Based on the results obtained from them, the safety
   and security requirements are derived for the identification and
   prevention/mitigation of potential platooning hazards, threats and
   vulnerabilities. The assurance cases are constructed to show the
   acceptable safety and security of materials transportation using AGV
   platooning. We leveraged a simulation-based digital twin for performing
   the verification and validation as well as finetuning of the platooning
   strategy. Simulation data is gathered from digital twin to monitor
   platoon operations, identify unexpected or incorrect behaviour, evaluate
   the potential implications, trigger control actions to resolve them, and
   continuously update assurance cases. The applicability of the AGV
   platooning is demonstrated in the context of a quarry site.},

Title = {Blockchain-Enabled IoT for Rural Healthcare: Hybrid-Channel
   Communication with Digital Twinning},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchains are enabling technologies for
   modern healthcare applications, offering the improved monitoring of
   patient health and higher data integrity guarantees. However, in rural
   settings, communication reliability can pose a challenge that constrains
   real-time data usage. Additionally, the limited computation and
   communication resources of IoT sensors also means that they may not
   participate directly in blockchain transactions, reducing trust. This
   paper proposes a solution to these challenges, enabling the use of
   blockchain-based IoT healthcare devices in low-bandwidth rural areas.
   This integrated system, named hybrid channel healthcare chain (HC2),
   uses two communication channels: short-range communication for device
   authorisation and bulk data transfer, and long-range the radio for
   light-weight monitoring and event notifications. Both channels leverage
   the same cryptographic identity information, and through the use of a
   cloud-based digital twin, the IoT device is able to sign its own
   transactions, without disclosing the key to said twin. Patient data are
   encrypted end to end between the IoT device and data store, with the
   blockchain providing a reliable record of the data lifecycle. We
   contribute a model, analytic evaluation and proof of concept for the HC2
   system that demonstrates its suitability for the stated scenarios by
   reducing the number of long-range radio packets needed by 87x compared
   to a conventional approach.},

Title = {Microgrid Digital Twins: Concepts, Applications, and Future Trends},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {2284-2302},
Abstract = {Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances
   in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning
   concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry
   worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital
   representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its
   physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation
   platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the
   real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT
   technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated,
   which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs.
   MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and
   real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs'
   operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and
   maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its
   key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for
   establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different
   applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator
   training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and
   policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied
   the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided.
   Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and
   resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of
   digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for
   resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future
   trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of a Real-Time Hardware-in-the-Loop Platform

Abstract = {Power systems worldwide are experiencing rapid evolvements with a
   massive increase of renewable generation in order to meet the ambitious
   decarbonization targets. A significant amount of renewable generation is
   from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), upon which the system
   operators often have limited visibility. This can bring significant
   challenges as the increasing DERs' can lead to network constraints being
   violated, presenting critical risks for network security. Enhancing the
   visibility of DERs can be achieved via the provision of communication
   links, but this can be costly, particularly for real time applications.
   Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is considered as a
   promising solution for enhancing the visibility of a physical system,
   where only a limited set of data is required to be transmitted with the
   rest data of interest can be estimated via the DT. The development and
   demonstration of DTs requires realistic testing and validation
   enviorment in order to accelerate its adoption in the industry. This
   paper presents a real time simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL)
   testing platform, specifically designed for prototyping, demonstrating
   and testing DTs of DERs. Within the proposed platform, a software-based
   communication emulator is developed, which allows the investigation of
   the impact of communication latency and jitter on the performance of DTs
   of the DERs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the application
   of the developed DT prototyping process and testing platform to enable
   frequency control using the DTs, which provide valuable learnings and
   tools for enabling future DTs-based solutions.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) has attracted a lot of attention from both industry
   and academia since it was proposed over a decade ago. A DT can be viewed
   as a virtual implementation of a real physical system (PS) and used as a
   representation of the PS for various applications. Despite the great
   potential of DTs in various fields, implementing DTs to obtain the
   desired functionality is not always straightforward. Specifically,
   accurate real-time synchronization between the features at a PS and its
   DT is essential for the DT to represent the PS. In this case,
   appropriate networking support is a key component to enable future DT
   development and applications. Currently, the research on DTs from a
   networking standpoint is still at an early stage, and only limited work
   has been done on DT implementation in practical systems. To fill this
   gap, this article investigates networking-related issues for DTs. Based
   on the existing literature, a feature-based method is provided for
   describing the desired properties and quality of DTs from the networking
   perspective. A stage-based implementation framework is presented for
   creating large-scale DTs for complex PSs by considering various
   networking constraints. Networking-related challenging issues and open
   research topics are discussed at the end.},

Title = {Digital Twins in Built Environments: An Investigation of the
   Characteristics, Applications, and Challenges},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The concept of digital twins is proposed as a new technology-led
   advancement to support the processes of the design, construction, and
   operation of built assets. Commonalities between the emerging
   definitions of digital twins describe them as digital or cyber
   environments that are bidirectionally-linked to their physical or
   real-life replica to enable simulation and data-centric decision making.
   Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of
   asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different
   levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However,
   questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation
   challenges, including their integration with other digital technologies
   (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality,
   Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing).
   Within the built environment context, this study seeks to analyze the
   definitions and characteristics of a digital twin, its interactions with
   other digital technologies used in built asset delivery and operation,
   and its applications and challenges. To achieve this aim, the research
   utilizes a thorough literature review and semi-structured interviews
   with ten industry experts. The literature review explores the merits and
   the relevance of digital twins relative to existing digital technologies
   and highlights potential applications and challenges for their
   implementation. The data from the semi-structured interviews are
   classified into five themes: definitions and enablers of digital twins,
   applications and benefits, implementation challenges, existing practical
   applications, and future development. The findings provide a point of
   departure for future research aimed at clarifying the relationship
   between digital twins and other digital technologies and their key
   implementation challenges.},

Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {210},

Abstract = {In the industrial Internet, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can provide the
   ability to transfer a large number of delay-sensitive and
   compute-intensive tasks to MEC servers, thus improving Quality of
   Service (QoS). Considering Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have the
   advantages of wide communication coverage and low deployment cost, UAVs
   have great potential to be employed as aerial base stations to provide
   computation resources for Intelligent Mobile Devices (IMDs). Due to the
   limited computation resources and energy of IMDs, we designed a
   multi-UAV-assisted MEC system in ground cells. To minimize the weighted
   sum of task completion delay and energy consumption, and ensure the QoS
   requirements of IMDs, we jointly consider the dynamic channel state,
   renewable energy utilization, UAVs trajectory, and tasks offloading
   ratio. To solve the non-convexity problem of complex high-dimensional
   states, we propose a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
   offloading scheme based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
   Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Moreover, we adopt Federated Learning (FL) to
   train DRL models to enhance the robustness of the model and the security
   of IMDs data. Meanwhile, the real environment is modeled as Digital Twin
   (DT) to monitor network changes and train the local DRL model, and the
   central cloud server can obtain the local model in real-time to
   aggregate the global model. Extensive experimental numerical results
   show that the proposed algorithm improves the system energy efficiency
   and reduces task completion delay.},

Title = {Digital twins, big data governance, and sustainable tourism},
Journal = {ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rapid adoption of digital technologies has revolutionized business
   operations and introduced emerging concepts such as Digital Twin (DT)
   technology, which has the potential to predict system responses before
   they occur, making it an attractive option for smart and sustainable
   tourism. However, implementing DT software systems poses significant
   challenges, including compliance with regulations and effective
   communication among stakeholders, and concerns surrounding security,
   privacy, and trust with the use of big data. To address these
   challenges, this paper proposes a documentation framework for
   architectural decisions (DFAD) that applies the concept of big data
   governance to the digital system. The framework aims to ensure
   accountability, transparency, and trustworthiness while adhering to
   rules and regulations. To demonstrate its applicability, a case study
   and three case scenarios on the potential use of Mobile Positioning Data
   (MPD) in Indonesia for DT technology in smart and sustainable tourism
   were examined. The paper highlights the benefits of DFAD in shaping
   stakeholder communication and human-machine interactions while
   leveraging the potential of MPD to measure tourism statistics by
   Statistics Indonesia since 2016. Not only the documentation framework
   promotes compliance with regulations, but it also facilitates effective
   communication among stakeholders and enhances trust and transparency in
   the use of big data in DT technology for smart and sustainable tourism.
   This paper emphasizes the importance of effective big data governance
   and its potential to promote sustainable tourism practices. The
   multidisciplinarity approach on political science, software engineering,
   tourism, and official statistics provides an opportunity for academic
   contribution and decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {The valve-side bushing of the UHV converter transformer is the key
   equipment in the DC transmission project, and its running state directly
   affects the security and stability of the power system. This paper
   analyses the attributes of the physical entities, uses the digital twins
   to establish the state feature set and proposes a zero-sample state
   evaluation algorithm for the valve-side bushing. First, the geometric,
   materials and electrical characteristics are analyzed, and the detailed
   components of carrier current are obtained by empirical mode
   decomposition. Then, COMSOL is used to establish digital twins, verify
   the validity of twins with axial heat distribution of bushing, and
   establish a state feature set with the extreme temperature inside and
   outside bushing. Finally, the fuzzy clustering algorithm is used to
   classify the state feature set, and the similarity is used as the index
   to realize the zero-sample state evaluation of the valve-side bushing.
   Through the demonstration and analysis of examples, the evaluation model
   solves the problems of difficulty in extracting the internal features,
   fewer fault samples, and training difficulty, which is conducive to
   improving the operation and maintenance management level of power
   transmission equipment.},

Abstract = {A critical requirement for robust, optimized, and secure design of
   vehicular systems is the ability to do system-level exploration, i.e.,
   comprehend the interactions involved among electronic control units
   (ECUs), sensors, and communication interfaces in realizing system-level
   use cases and the impact of various design choices on these
   interactions. This must be done early in the system design to enable the
   designer to make optimal design choices without requiring a
   cost-prohibitive design overhaul. In this article, we develop a virtual
   prototyping environment for the modeling and simulation of vehicular
   systems. Our solution, ViVE, is modular and configurable, allowing the
   user to conveniently introduce new system-level use cases. Unlike other
   related simulation environments, our platform emphasizes coordination
   and communication among various vehicular components and just the
   abstraction of the necessary computation of each ECU. We discuss the
   ability of ViVE to explore the interactions between a number of
   realistic use cases in the automotive domain. We demonstrate the utility
   of the platform, in particular, to create real-time in-vehicle
   communication optimizers for various optimization targets. We also show
   how to use such a prototyping environment to explore vehicular security
   compromises. Furthermore, we showcase the experimental integration and
   validation of the platform with a hardware setup in a real-time

Title = {New Framework for Complex Assembly Digitalization and Traceability Using
   Bill of Assembly and Smart Contracts},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework to automate the generation of traceable
   and protected documentation of complex assembly processes. The final
   assembly in aviation, automotive, and appliances industries is a
   rigorous process that has limited capabilities of full traceability
   associated with: (1) the parts installed, (2) their fabrication
   processes, and (3) the assembly work. This is also the case for each of
   its sub-assemblies. The thousands of parts forming a hierarchy of
   sub-assemblies that are dynamically accumulated to compose the final
   assembly make full traceability a challenging feat that is almost
   unsurmountable. Such full traceability along the entire supply chain
   requires considerable cost and effort since it must be based on
   documentation of most assembled parts, assembly tasks, and inspection
   tasks that compose the full assembled product. In addition, security
   measures are needed to prevent hostile hacking and unauthorized approach
   to the assembly documentation throughout the entire supply chain. The
   related documentation and repeated verifications require considerable
   effort and have many chances for human errors. So, automating these
   processes has great value. This article expounds a framework that
   harnesses blockchain and smart-contract technology to offer automated
   traceable and protected documentation of the assembly process. For this
   purpose, we expand the concept of a Bill-Of-Assembly (BOA) to
   incorporate data from the bill of materials (BOM), the associated
   assembly activities, the associated activities' specification parameters
   and materials, and the associated assembly resources (machines and/or
   operators). The paper defines the operation of the BOA with blockchain
   and smart-contract technology, for attaining full traceability, safety,
   and security, for the entire assembled product. Future research could
   extend the proposed approach to facilitate the usage of the BOA data
   structure in constructing a digital twin of the entire simulated system.},

Abstract = {Industry 4.0 is evolving through technological advancements, leveraging
   information technology to enhance industry with digitalisation and
   intelligent activities. Whereas Industry 5.0 is the Age of Augmentation,
   striving to concentrate on human-centricity, sustainability, and
   resilience of the intelligent factories and synergetic industry. The
   crucial enhancer for the improvements accomplished by digital
   transformation is the notion of `digital triplet D3', which is an
   augmentation of the digital twin with artificial intelligence, human
   ingenuity, and experience. digital triplet D3 encompasses intelligent
   activities based on human awareness and the convergence among
   cyberspace, physical space, and humans, in which Implementing useful
   reference hierarchy is a crucial part of instigating Industry 5.0 into a
   reality. This paper depicts a digital triplet which discloses the
   potency of retrofitting a conventional drilling machine. This hierarchy
   included the perceptive level for complex decision-making by deploying

   concatenated level for controlling the physical system's behaviour
   predictions and emulation, the observing level is the iterative
   observation of the actual behaviour of the physical system using
   real-time data, and the duplicating level visualises and emulates
   virtual features through physical tasks. The accomplishment demonstrated
   the viability of the hierarchy in imitating the real-time functionality
   of the physical system in cyberspace, an immaculate performance of this
   paradigm. The digital triplet's complexity was diminished through the
   interaction among facile digital twins, intelligent activities, and
   human awareness. The performance parameters of the digital triplet D3
   paradigm for retrofitting were eventually confirmed through appraising,
   anomaly analysis, and real-time monitoring.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming a prevalent part of our
   society offering operational flexibility and convenience. However,
   insecure provisioning makes the IoT devices susceptible to various
   cyberattacks. For instance, mal-provisioned devices may leak sensitive
   information allowing the attackers to eavesdrop or disrupt communication
   infrastructures. Furthermore, compromised devices can act as zombies to
   intensify the scale of the attack. Hence, we need secure device
   provisioning services which can counteract such attacks and adverse
   circumstances. This article proposes a secure smart device provisioning
   and monitoring service architecture (SDPM) for smart network
   infrastructures, such as IoT-enabled smart home or office and Industrial
   IoT infrastructures. Our architecture allows the provisioning of devices
   in such a way that the malicious devices can be controlled and their
   activities using a dynamic policy-based approach. SDPM introduces an IoT
   device ontology for device registration and authentication and uses the
   ontology to construct device category and service-specific policies.
   SDPM provides a fine granular pre and post condition-based policies to
   provision securely the IoT devices and control their runtime operations.
   Furthermore, SDPM utilizes the digital twin concept, to monitor
   dynamically the security status of IoT devices at runtime. The policies
   associated with a device's twin enables the SDPM to automate security
   capabilities, such as device firmware updating and patching for security
   vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {The previous applications of new digital methods (BIM) in infrastructure
   construction have led to the realization that merely a building
   information model is not sufficient for the ambitious goals of an
   optimized planning process and, as a result, optimized construction
   management. Two additional models are needed: that of the ground and
   that of the construction site. In infrastructure and above all in
   underground construction, the ground and its interaction with the
   structure work are of enormous importance. It is therefore necessary to
   map it accordingly using a ground model and thus to do justice to the
   ideal case of a ``digital twin{''}. The modeling of the ground goes
   beyond a mere three-dimensional geometrical representation and has to do
   justice to the BIM method, namely to assign information and
   characteristics to volume bodies. In addition, ongoing major
   international projects clearly show that the optimization of
   construction operation aspects, careful planning of jobsite equipment
   and a consistent design of logistics play a decisive role in the
   production performance of tunnelling and thus in increased cost and
   schedule security. Therefore, the authors present in this paper the
   introduction of an infrastructure information model, which contains the
   three submodels ground, building and construction site. The main focus
   will be on underground construction, more precisely on mechanized
   tunnelling.},

Title = {A Roadmap to Integrate Digital Twins for Small and Medium-Sized
   Enterprises},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the last decade, Australian SMEs are steadily becoming more digitally
   engaged, but they still face issues and barriers to fully adopt Industry
   4.0 (I4.0). Among the tools that I4.0 encompasses, digital twin (DT) and
   digital thread (DTH) technologies hold significant interest and value.
   Some of the challenges are the lack of expertise in developing the
   communication framework required for data collection, processing, and
   storing; concerns about data and cyber security; lack of knowledge of
   the digitization and visualisation of data; and value generation for
   businesses from the data. This article aims to demonstrate the
   feasibility of DT implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs) by developing a framework based on simple and low-cost solutions
   and providing insight and guidance to overcome technological barriers.
   To do so, this paper first outlines the theoretical framework and its
   components, and subsequently discusses a simplified and generalised DT
   model of a real-world physical asset that demonstrates how these
   components function, how they are integrated and how they interact with
   each other. An experimental scenario is presented to transform data
   harvested from a resistance temperature detector sensor connected with a
   WAGO 750-8102 Programmable Logic Controller for data storage and
   analysis, predictive simulation and modelling. Our results demonstrate
   that sensor data could be readily integrated from Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) devices and enabling DT technologies, where users could view real
   time data and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the form of a 3D
   model. Data from both the sensor and 3D model are viewable in a
   comprehensive history log through a database. Via this technological
   demonstration, we provide several recommendations on software, hardware,
   and expertise that SMEs may adopt to assist with their DT
   implementations.},

Abstract = {The security technology of digital twin is an important guarantee to
   ensure the security of digital twin operation, which mainly includes
   network security technology, data security technology and privacy
   protection technology. In wireless sensor networks, data aggregation
   technologies are known as a suitable solution to reduce energy
   consumption. In addition, due to wireless communications, wireless
   sensor networks are subject to many attacks. Therefore, it is very
   important to provide data security in the data aggregation process. In
   this paper, in order to protect data privacy and verify data integrity,
   moreover, balance the energy consumption and security during the data
   aggregation, we present a privacy and integrity-preserving data
   aggregation scheme for wireless sensor networks based on digital twins
   technology and homomorphic fingerprinting (HFPIDA). The HFPIDA adopts
   privacy function to protect data privacy and adopts homomorphic
   fingerprinting technology to verify the aggregation data integrity.
   Security analysis shows that the HFPIDA can effectively preserve data
   privacy and verify data integrity. Simulation results show that the
   HFPIDA requires less communication and energy overheads, and can achieve
   higher aggregation accuracy.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure
   have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart
   healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices.
   However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial
   intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues
   concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users.
   The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and
   can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL),
   a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy
   preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the
   participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only
   gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of
   FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT.
   Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy
   preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by
   incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and
   generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats.
   Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the
   end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and
   challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems.},

Title = {Primary frequency response from hydrogen-based bidirectional vector
   coupling storage: modelling and demonstration using
   power-hardware-in-the-loop simulation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {To meet reduction targets for carbon emissions and improve the
   flexibility and security of the energy supply, future energy networks
   will require enhanced energy vector coupling in addition to the
   generation of energy from renewable sources. Increased renewable
   generation penetration significantly affects the electrical grid's
   inertia and consequently the severity and regularity of frequency
   deviations from nominal values. Bidirectional Hydrogen-based Vector
   Coupling Storage (VCS) has been explored as a means to provide primary
   frequency response (PFR) services to the electrical network. This paper
   demonstrates the use of Power Hardware-In-the-Loop (PHIL) simulation and
   Digital Twin (DT) technique for such an application. This new suggested
   structure of VCS is composed of grid-scale electrolysers, fuel cells,
   and hydrogen storage. Existing works focus on unidirectional VCS, and
   also use simplifications or neglect the impacts of power converters on
   the performance of the VCS. In addition, these works do not have any
   control over the hydrogen storage, therefore there is no guarantee that
   there will be enough energy available in the storage to meet the PFR
   service responsibilities. This paper presents the dynamic models of
   electrolysis, fuel cell stacks, and hydrogen storage as a DT. The key
   parameters affecting the behaviours of these main components are
   considered. The power converters' accurate impact on the VCS's
   performance is considered through PHIL simulations. The level of stored
   hydrogen is also considered in the VCS controller. The DT representing
   the VCS is integrated with the PHIL setup representing the deployment
   environment. The impact of VCS is then analysed as it propagates to the
   deployment environment. Results of the considered case studies
   demonstrate that the size of the VCS plays a significant role in
   bringing the frequency to the statutory allowed range. In addition, more
   VCS capacity was installed, the nadir frequency improved. Furthermore,
   the VCS is fast enough to offer PFR. The response times of the VCS were
   2.857 s (during under-frequency periods), corresponding to the operation
   of the fuel cells, and 2.252 s during over-frequency periods,
   corresponding to electrolyser operation.},

Abstract = {A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system

   connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the
   cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity
   measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational
   environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies
   reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes
   cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an
   industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen
   cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to
   transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and
   analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set
   of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been
   proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the
   enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real
   automation. This course has been taught in a master's degree and
   students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey.
   The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the
   students' and faculty's viewpoint.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical objects or systems. This
   new technology is increasingly being adopted in industry to improve the
   monitoring and efficiency of products and organizations. In healthcare,
   digital human twins (DHTs) represent virtual copies of patients,
   including tissues, organs, and physiological processes. Their
   application has the potential to transform patient care in the direction
   of increasingly personalized data-driven medicine. The use of DHTs can
   be integrated with digital twins of healthcare institutions to improve
   organizational management processes and resource allocation. By modeling
   the complex multi-omics interactions between genetic and environmental
   factors, DHTs help monitor disease progression and optimize treatment
   plans. Through digital simulation, DHT models enable the selection of
   the most appropriate molecular therapy and accurate 3D representation
   for precision surgical planning, together with augmented reality tools.
   Furthermore, they allow for the development of tailored early diagnosis
   protocols and new targeted drugs. Furthermore, digital twins can
   facilitate medical training and education. By creating virtual anatomy
   and physiology models, medical students can practice procedures, enhance
   their skills, and improve their understanding of the human body.
   Overall, digital twins have immense potential to revolutionize
   healthcare, improving patient care and outcomes, reducing costs, and
   enhancing medical research and education. However, challenges such as
   data security, data quality, and data interoperability must be addressed
   before the widespread adoption of digital twins in healthcare. We aim to
   propose a narrative review on this hot topic to provide an overview of
   the potential applications of digital twins to improve treatment and
   diagnostics, but also of the challenges related to their development and
   widespread diffusion.},

Abstract = {Digital twins are emerging as powerful tools for supporting innovation
   as well as optimizing the in-service performance of a broad range of
   complex physical machines, devices, and components. A digital twin is
   generally designed to provide accurate in-silico representation of the
   form (i.e., appearance) and the functional response of a specified
   (unique) physical twin. This paper offers a new perspective on how the
   emerging concept of digital twins could be applied to accelerate
   materials innovation efforts. Specifically, it is argued that the
   material itself can be considered as a highly complex multiscale
   physical system whose form (i.e., details of the material structure over
   a hierarchy of material length) and function (i.e., response to external
   stimuli typically characterized through suitably defined material
   properties) can be captured suitably in a digital twin. Accordingly, the
   digital twin can represent the evolution of structure, process, and
   performance of the material over time, with regard to both process
   history and in-service environment. This paper establishes the
   foundational concepts and frameworks needed to formulate and
   continuously update both the form and function of the digital twin of a
   selected material physical twin. The form of the proposed material
   digital twin can be captured effectively using the broadly applicable
   framework of n-point spatial correlations, while its function at the
   different length scales can be captured using homogenization and
   localization process-structure-property surrogate models calibrated to
   collections of available experimental and physics-based simulation data.},

Abstract = {Innovative solutions have been conceptualized in the healthcare sector
   to increase patient life expectancy while decreasing healthcare costs.
   As a state-of-the-art innovation, Digital Twins (DT) have the potential
   to revolutionize healthcare. DT is creating a digital representation of
   a real-world object that represents the current state by dynamically
   updating its data. Conspicuously, to protect the confidentiality of
   health data, cutting-edge methods like the Internet of Things (IoT),
   discrete-time, fog computing, and blockchain technology are utilized to
   create a comprehensive context-aware physical activity monitoring
   framework for adult care. In the current research, deep learning's
   capacity to process data sequentially is used to examine an elderly
   person's motions to determine signs of abnormality. Furthermore, the
   proposed framework can secure individual data using the advanced
   security features of blockchain. The presented method can perform a
   timely and accurate analysis of a person's abnormal occurrence.
   Experimental simulation results have shown enhanced efficacy of DT with
   intelligent healthcare solutions that would aid in the development of
   efficient medical services. Specifically, the effectiveness of the
   proposed solution is evaluated in terms of its ability to identify
   anomalous events, data model, processing delay, and cost computation.},

   certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are
   safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly
   developed application case study of artificial intelligence in
   healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are
   discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases
   (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory
   diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare
   systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the
   essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design,
   methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor
   networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent
   systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated,
   such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications
   that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation
   networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes,
   business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social
   and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general
   architecture-data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and
   action-are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be
   employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations
   in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare
   established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support
   safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough
   experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling
   innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing,
   developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational
   and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed
   encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of
   tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of
   opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligencebased
   MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.},

Abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for critical decision-making
   processes. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls
   for an infrastructure that can ensure the trustworthiness of data. To
   this end, we envision a blockchain-based framework for the Industrial
   Internet of Things (IIoT) to address the issues of data management and
   security. Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded
   in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven
   systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In
   this regard, we leverage digital twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent
   conclusions from the data by identifying the faults and recommending
   precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss
   the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of
   disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault
   diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT
   and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs.},

   Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {26258-26288},
Abstract = {Envisioned to be the next-generation Internet, the metaverse has been
   attracting enormous attention from both the academia and industry. The
   metaverse can be viewed as a 3D immersive virtual world, where people
   use Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices to access and interact
   with others through digital avatars. While early versions of the
   metaverse exist in several Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, the
   full-flesh metaverse is expected to be more complex and enabled by
   various advanced technologies. Blockchain is one of the crucial
   technologies that could revolutionize the metaverse to become a
   decentralized and democratic virtual society with its own economic and
   governance system. Realizing the importance of blockchain for the
   metaverse, our goal in this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey
   that clarifies the role of blockchain in the metaverse including
   in-depth analysis of digital asset management. To this end, we discuss
   how blockchain can enable the metaverse from different perspectives,
   ranging from user applications to virtual services and the
   blockchain-enabled economic system. Furthermore, we describe how
   blockchain can shape the metaverse from the system perspective,
   including various solutions for the decentralized governance system and
   data management. The potential of blockchain for security and privacy
   aspects of the metaverse infrastructure is also figured out, while a
   full flow of blockchain-based digital asset management for the metaverse
   is investigated. Finally, we discuss a wide range of open challenges of
   the blockchain-empowered metaverse.},

Abstract = {Based on classical contagion models we introduce an artificial cyber
   lab: the digital twin of a complex cyber system in which possible cyber
   resilience measures may be implemented and tested. Using the lab, in
   numerical case studies, we identify two classes of measures to control
   systemic cyber risks: security- and topology-based interventions. We
   discuss the implications of our findings on selected real-world
   cybersecurity measures currently applied in the insurance and regulation
   practice or under discussion for future cyber risk control. To this end,
   we provide a brief overview of the current cybersecurity regulation and
   emphasize the role of insurance companies as private regulators.
   Moreover, from an insurance point of view, we provide first attempts to
   design systemic cyber risk obligations and to measure the systemic risk
   contribution of individual policyholders.},

Title = {Enabling simulation services for digital twins of 5G/B5G mobile networks},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {213},
Pages = {33-48},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) have been proposed as digital replicas of physical
   entities (e.g., manufacturing equipment), which one can observe in
   real-time and interact with. Digital Twins of Networks (DTNs) are
   increasingly being discussed in the literature, as an enabler for
   efficient data-driven network management and performance-driven network
   optimization (e.g., to support dynamic reconfiguration, or anticipate
   the effects of faults). A DTN includes service mapping models, i.e.
   models that can be fed with acquired data to produce insight on the
   network itself - e.g., to run what-if scenarios, based on multiple
   underlying technologies, from Machine Learning to analytical models,
   e.g. Markov Chains. In this paper we examine the case of DTNs of mobile
   networks, DTMNs, tailored to 5G and beyond, where issues of dynamic
   reconfiguration and fault anticipation are critical. We argue that
   simulation services should be offered by the DTMN in order to allow
   performance-driven network optimization, and that discrete-event network
   simulators are ideal instruments to be employed for this purpose. We
   discuss the challenges that need be addressed to make this happen, e.g.,
   centralized vs. distributed implementation, gathering input from the
   physical network, security issues and hosting, and we review the
   possibilities offered by network simulation in terms of what-if
   analysis, defining the concepts of lockstep and branching analysis. We
   present a framework to endow a DTMN with simulation services and we
   exemplify it using Simu5G, a popular 5G/B5G simulation library for
   OMNeT++, as a reference case study.},

Abstract = {To achieve the potential of smart cities, there is a strong requirement
   to use a set of useful, but still accessible services within smart city
   systems. Interoperability challenges and roadblocks for software
   developers and integrators are well-known consequences of fragmented
   semantics across different contexts. Furthermore, in the smart city
   context, there is a need to ensure the security and identity of
   real-world services operating on this data through the adoption of
   access control principles (authorization and authentication). The use of
   ontologies to unify the diverse semantics of multiple domains is one
   strategy that has had considerable success in the past. This paper
   describes an access management ontology in smart cities developed to
   enable the interoperability of physical built environment assets,
   sensing and actuation devices and current built environment services
   with existing security standards, digital twin and Building Information
   Model (BIM) datasets. It also provides interoperability between user
   interfaces and the actors who use them in the context of establishing an
   access management in smart cities framework for the built environment.
   This has been validated through its implementation in the Cardiff Urban
   Sustainability Platform (CUSP), deployed to manage a variety of smart
   services on a university campus. This validation has successfully shown
   the ability of the ontology to function as intended in the context of a
   digital twin, thereby offering single sign-on and suitable access
   control.},

Title = {A data-driven operational model for traffic at the Dallas Fort Worth
   International Airport},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Airports are on the front line of significant innovations, allowing the
   movement of more people and goods faster, cheaper, and with greater
   convenience. As air travel continues to grow, airports will face
   challenges in responding to increasing passenger vehicle traffic, which
   leads to lower operational efficiency, poor air quality, and security
   concerns. This paper evaluates methods for traffic demand forecasting
   combined with traffic microsimulation, which will allow airport
   operations staff to accurately predict traffic and congestion. Using two
   years of detailed data describing individual vehicle arrivals and
   departures, aircraft movements, and weather at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
   International Airport, we evaluate multiple prediction methods including
   the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) family of models,
   traditional machine learning models, and DeepAR, a modern recurrent
   neural network (RNN). We find that these algorithms are able to capture
   the diurnal trends in the surface traffic, and all do very well when
   predicting the next 30 minutes of demand. Longer forecast horizons are
   moderately effective, demonstrating the challenge of this problem and
   highlighting promising techniques as well as potential areas for
   improvement. Traffic demand is not the only factor that contributes to
   terminal congestion, because temporary changes to the road network, such
   as a lane closure, can make benign traffic demand highly congested.
   Combining a demand forecast with a traffic microsimulation framework
   provides a complete picture of traffic and its consequences. The result
   is an operational intelligence platform for exploring policy changes, as
   well as infrastructure expansion and disruption scenarios. To
   demonstrate the value of this approach, we present results from a case
   study at DFW Airport assessing the impact of a policy change for vehicle
   routing in high demand scenarios. This framework can assist airports
   like DFW as they tackle daily operational challenges, as well as explore
   the integration of emerging technology and expansion of their services
   into long term plans.},

Abstract = {Featured Application
   Perimeter security of stationary aircraft on a landing strip; autonomous
   vehicle navigation with dynamic obstacles.
   Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in
   the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system
   life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts.
   The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible framework to
   efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use
   digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative
   evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system
   performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE
   experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current
   testbed comprises several components, including a scenario builder, a
   smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios,
   connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation
   engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been
   successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security
   system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for
   autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated
   and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system
   behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and
   conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop
   control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are
   presented along with a discussion of future directions.},

Abstract = {The recent increase in computational capability has led to an
   unprecedented increase in the range of new applications where machine
   learning can be used in real time. Notwithstanding the range of use
   cases where automation is now feasible, humans are likely to retain a
   critical role in the operation and certification of manufacturing
   systems for the foreseeable future. This paper presents a use case
   review of how human operators affect the performance of cyber-physical
   systems within a `smart' or `cognitive' setting. Such applications are
   classified using Industry 4.0 (I4.0) or 5.0 (I5.0) terminology. The
   authors argue that, as there is often no general agreement as to when a
   specific use case moves from being an I4.0 to an I5.0 example, the use
   of a hybrid Industry X.0 notation at the intersection between I4.0 and
   I5.0 is warranted. Through a structured review of the literature, the
   focus is on how secure human-mediated autonomous production can be
   performed most effectively to augment and optimise machine operation.},

   Twins and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large
   scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control
   requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel
   structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and
   artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of
   prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is
   proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and
   DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion
   mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive
   intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In
   addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent
   control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By
   considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the
   tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing
   the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent
   tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent
   tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and
   intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional
   integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of
   the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of
   digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the
   intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses
   on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance.
   This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI
   in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.},

Title = {Additive Manufacturing Cyber-Physical System: Supply Chain Cybersecurity
   and Risks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {47322-47333},
Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) methods have become increasingly efficient
   and industrially viable in the past ten years. These methods offer the
   freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and
   pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM
   have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid
   growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general
   characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain
   models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of
   the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply
   chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the
   virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively
   manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain
   (<italic>digital thread</italic>) with the physical supply chain and
   their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical
   system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of
   a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible
   attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse
   engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk
   classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity
   methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that
   threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing
   solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In
   providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies
   of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate
   the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further,
   we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and
   identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged.},

Title = {A systematic survey of attack detection and prevention in Connected and

Journal = {VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The number of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is increasing
   rapidly in various smart transportation services and applications,
   considering many benefits to society, people, and the environ-ment.
   Several research surveys for CAVs were conducted by primarily focusing
   on various security threats and vulnerabilities in the domain of CAVs to
   classify different types of attacks, impacts of attacks, attack
   features, cyber-risk, defense methodologies against attacks, and safety
   standards. However, the importance of attack detection and prevention
   approaches for CAVs has not been discussed extensively in the
   state-of-the-art surveys, and there is a clear gap in the existing
   literature on such methodologies to detect new and conventional threats
   and protect the CAV systems from unexpected hazards on the road. Some
   surveys have a limited discussion on Attacks Detection and Prevention
   Systems (ADPS), but such surveys provide only partial coverage of
   different types of ADPS for CAVs. Furthermore, there is a scope for
   discussing security, privacy, and efficiency challenges in ADPS that can
   give an overview of important security and performance attributes. This
   survey paper, therefore, presents the significance of CAVs in the
   market, potential challenges in CAVs, key requirements of essential
   security and privacy properties, various capabilities of adversaries,
   possible attacks in CAVs, and performance evaluation parameters for
   ADPS. An extensive analysis is discussed of different ADPS categories
   for CAVs and state-of-the-art research works based on each ADPS category
   that gives the latest findings in this research domain. This survey also
   discusses crucial and open security research problems that are required
   to be focused on the secure deployment of CAVs in the market. (C) 2022

Title = {Protecting Modbus/TCP-Based Industrial Automation and Control Systems
   Using Message Authentication Codes},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {47007-47023},
Abstract = {Critical infrastructure (CI), such as energy and water distribution
   systems, is essential for the stability and well-being of the modern
   society. Industrial automation and control systems (IACSs) form the
   backbone of CIs and enable the operation of such systems in a safe and
   reliable manner. However, with the increasing use of industrial Ethernet
   communication protocols, such as Modbus-over-TCP (Modbus/TCP), once
   air-gapped IACSs are becoming vulnerable to potential cybersecurity
   threats. This paper presents a novel method for enhancing the
   cybersecurity of Modbus/TCP-based IACSs by implementing an
   authentication method based on message authentication codes (MACs). To
   provide partial protection of communication even when communicating with
   legacy Modbus/TCP peers, we propose a novel supervising device that
   analyzes exchanged messages and verifies the authenticity of the
   protected messages. To experimentally verify the protection method, a
   water-treatment cyber-physical system (CPS) was implemented as a digital
   twin in a programmable logic controller (PLC). The underlying MAC is the
   Chaskey-12, lightweight MAC defined in IEC 29192-6. It was implemented
   in the PLC program using the programming languages defined in IEC
   61131-3. As an additional contribution, the presented implementation
   allows protection of communication between PLCs and other Modbus/TCP
   peers installed in existing IACSs without hardware or firmware
   modifications. The results show that the method provides protection
   against network attacks without significantly affecting performance,
   also demonstrating the feasibility of such protection in IACSs.},

Abstract = {As DNA sequencing and synthesis become cheaper and more easily
   accessible, the scale and complexity of biological engineering projects
   is set to grow. Yet, although there is an accelerating convergence
   between biotechnology and digital technology, a deficit in software and
   laboratory techniques diminishes the ability to make biotechnology more
   agile, reproducible, and transparent while, at the same time, limiting
   the security and safety of synthetic biology constructs. To partially
   address some of these problems, this paper presents an approach for
   physically linking engineered cells to their digital footprint-we called
   it digital twinning. This enables the tracking of the entire engineering
   history of a cell line in a specialized version control system for
   collaborative strain engineering via simple barcoding protocols.},

Abstract = {Currently, the concept of Industry 4.0 is well known; however, it is
   extremely complex, as it is constantly evolving and innovating. It
   includes the participation of many disciplines and areas of knowledge as
   well as the integration of many technologies, both mature and emerging,
   but working in collaboration and relying on their study and
   implementation under the novel criteria of Cyber-Physical Systems. This
   study starts with an exhaustive search for updated scientific
   information of which a bibliometric analysis is carried out with results
   presented in different tables and graphs. Subsequently, based on the
   qualitative analysis of the references, we present two proposals for the
   schematic analysis of Industry 4.0 that will help academia and companies
   to support digital transformation studies. The results will allow us to
   perform a simple alternative analysis of Industry 4.0 to understand the
   functions and scope of the integrating technologies to achieve a better
   collaboration of each area of knowledge and each professional,
   considering the potential and limitations of each one, supporting the
   planning of an appropriate strategy, especially in the management of
   human resources, for the successful execution of the digital

Title = {A critical review on efficient thermal environment controls in indoor
   vertical farming},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {425},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Indoor vertical farming (IVF) has expanded exponentially over the last
   couple of years and is expected to have a compound annual growth rate
   (CAGR) of 25.9\% from 2022 to 2029. IVF has enormous potential to ensure
   food security for the increased world population and other
   socio-economic benefits than traditional agricultural systems. However,
   the high energy demand, capital costs, and limitation in crop variety to
   be grown are major challenges to achieving the triple pillars (planter,
   people, and profit) of sustainability. The scholarly article
   comprehensively analyzes the current technologies, methodologies, and
   challenges in indoor thermal environment control (temperature, humidity,
   lighting, air circulation) and their integration with sustainability
   objectives. Space conditioning is achieved using heating, ventilation,
   air conditioning, dehumidification (HVACD), artificial lighting, and air
   circulation, which are energy-intensive due to the sealed envelope of
   IVF. Previous studies indicate energy consumption for lighting and space
   conditioning is the primary barrier to achieving sustainability. Minimal
   research activities have been reported for investigating the pathway to
   reduce the energy costs for lighting and HVACD systems for IVF.
   Integrating the air-side economizer and localized air supply for indoor
   climate control could save a significant amount of energy. The shifting
   electric demand and dynamic control also have enormous potential to
   reduce energy costs for lighting and HVACD. Integrating the transient
   model for heat gain/loss from plants and lighting heat gain is essential
   for precise energy simulation, which is critical for designing and
   sizing the right HVACD equipment and completing energy analysis. The
   research also shows that integrating green energy sources for HVACD and
   lighting reduces the environmental impacts on a large scale. Therefore,
   future research should focus on integrating renewable energy
   (geothermal, solar, wind, hydro) for HVACD, energy-efficient lighting
   technologies, and digital twin platforms for precision controls to
   reduce the energy and labor costs for thermal environmental controls in
   IVF.},

Title = {Threat modelling for industrial cyber physical systems in the era of
   smart manufacturing},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cyber security risks are considered to be one of the foremost challenges
   that face organisations intending to leverage the benefits of the Smart
   Manufacturing paradigm. Due to the rising number of cyber-attacks that
   target critical Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), organisations
   are required to consider such attacks as severe business risks.
   Therefore, identifying potential cyber threats and analysing their
   impacts is crucial to business continuity planning. This paper proposes
   a structured threat modelling approach for ICPS that enables prediction
   and analysis of cyber risks to protect industrial assets from potential
   cyber-attacks. The method involves classifying ICPS assets based on
   criticality, and then analysing the cyber security vulner-abilities,
   threats, risks, impacts, and countermeasures. The proposed methodology
   enables end-to-end threat modelling through the development of a new
   framework that is integrated with VueOne digital twin tool to model and
   analyse threats throughout ICPS lifecycle, identifying cyber risks and
   proposing mitigation controls. Moreover, it uses meta-data extracted
   from VueOne tool to automatically generate the software code and
   hardware configurations that can be directly deployed on ICPS assets in
   order to implement the countermeasures, thereby protecting them from
   these potential cyber-attacks. The proposed solution has been
   implemented on a Festo test rig prototype production line. (C) 2022

Abstract = {The Metaverse can be regarded as a hypothesized iteration of the
   Internet, which enables people to work, play, and interact socially in a
   persist online 3-D virtual environment with an immersive experience, by
   generating an imaginary environment similar to the real world, including
   realistic sounds, images, and other sensations. The Metaverse has strict
   requirements for a fully-immersive experience, large-scale concurrent
   users, and seamless connectivity, which poses many unprecedented
   challenges to the sixth generation (6G) wireless system, such as
   ubiquitous connectivity, ultra-low latency, ultra-high capacity and
   reliability, and strict security. In addition, to achieve the immersive
   and hassle-free experience of mass users, the full coverage sensing,
   seamless computation, reliable caching, and persistent consensus and
   security should be carefully considered to integrate into the future 6G
   system. To this end, this article aims to depict the roadmap to the
   Metaverse in terms of communication and networking in 6G, including
   illustrating the framework of the Metaverse, revealing the strict

   complex domestic and global networks and interactions spanning across
   various organizations and entities. This gives rise to numerous
   challenges related to information and data pertaining to medical devices
   used within healthcare supply chain, including data integrity,
   provenance, traceability, and transparency. Counterfeit medical devices
   are a major obstacle that the healthcare industry is trying to resolve
   as it poses a huge risk to the safety of its users. Therefore, it is
   paramount to have an end-to-end system in place that tracks medical
   devices not only as they move across the supply chain but also as they
   are purchased and sold online in digital marketplaces. Unfortunately,
   existing systems follow a centralized architecture, which leads to being
   a single point of failure and eradicating transparency and
   authentication. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT)
   based solution that exploits blockchain smart contracts, integrates
   tokenization protocols, and utilizes a decentralized storage system for
   a reliable and efficient medical devices traceability system and
   ownership management solution. In our proposed system, NFTs are used to
   represent the digital twin of the medical device. This digital twin
   captures the medical device attributes and its relevant metadata during
   its life cycle from production, manufacturing, distribution and
   movement, to current use and ownership. We present the system
   architecture and implementation details, along with tested algorithms
   that define the various functions of our smart contracts. The paper also
   presents testing details and analyses the solution's feasibility through
   a cost and security analysis.},

Title = {Key Component Capture and Safety Intelligent Analysis of Beam String
   Structure Based on Digital Twins},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},

Abstract = {In the construction process of beam string structures, the environmental
   effect and corresponding mechanical properties of the structure are
   complex. The problem of the misjudgment of structural safety performance
   caused by the uncertainty of a structural mechanical parameter analysis
   under various factors needs to be solved. In this study, a method for
   capturing key components and an intelligent safety analysis of beam
   string structures based on digital twins (DTs) was proposed. Combined
   with the characteristics of DTs mapping feedback, a component capture
   and security analysis framework was formed. Driven by twin framework,
   multi-source data for structural safety analysis were obtained and the
   parameter association mechanism established. Considering the space-time
   evolution and the interaction between the virtual and real elements of
   the construction process, a multidimensional model was established.
   Driven by the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, the fusion of
   structural mechanics parameters was carried out. The safety of the
   structure was analyzed intelligently by capturing key structural
   components, thereby providing a basis for the safety maintenance of the
   structure. The integration of DTs modeling and multi-source data
   improves the accuracy and intelligence of structural construction safety
   analysis. In the analysis process, capturing the key components of the
   structure is the core step. Taking the construction process of a string
   supported beam roof (symmetrical structure) in a convention and
   exhibition center as an example, the outlined research method was
   applied. Based on DTs and D-S evidence theory, the variation degree of
   mechanical parameters of various components under temperature was
   determined. By comprehensively investigating the changes of various
   mechanical parameters, the key components of the structure were
   captured. Thus, the intelligent analysis of structural safety was
   realized. The comparison of data verified that the intelligent method
   can effectively analyze the safety performance of the structure.},

Title = {Project Data Categorization, Adoption Factors, and Non-Functional
   Requirements for Blockchain Based Digital Twins in the Construction
   Industry 4.0},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {As key technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, blockchain and
   digital twins have great potential to enhance collaboration, data
   sharing, efficiency, and sustainability in the construction industry.
   Blockchain can improve data integrity and enhance trust in the data
   value chain throughout the entire lifecycle of projects. This paper aims
   to develop a novel theoretical framework for the adoption of
   environmentally sustainable blockchain-based digital twins (BCDT) for
   Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from
   construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit
   CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and
   non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a
   decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of
   the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects
   lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and
   what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the
   adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of
   structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate
   the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework
   for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The
   findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs
   relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new
   dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2)
   Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is
   decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new
   level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance
   collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data
   sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main
   non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy,
   interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the
   decentralization and scalability of data storage. With the proposed
   framework including the BCDT dimensions, the Maturity Level 4, and the
   key non-functional requirements, this paper provides the building blocks
   for industry practitioners to adopt BCDTs. This is promising for CI 4.0
   to embrace a paradigm shift towards decentralized ecosystems of united
   BCDTs where trust, collaboration, data sharing, information security,
   efficiency, and sustainability are improved throughout the lifecycle of
   projects and within a decentralized CE (DCE).},

Abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry continuously looks for ways to improve its
   development and manufacturing efficiency. In recent years, such efforts
   have been driven by the transition from batch to continuous

   development of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing processes under
   the Industry 4.0 framework, improving digital maturity and enabling the
   development of digital twins. This paper demonstrates two instances
   where a data integration framework has been successfully employed in
   academic continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing pilot plants. Details
   of the integration structure and information flows are comprehensively
   showcased. Approaches to mitigate concerns in incorporating complex data
   streams, including integrating multiple process analytical technology
   tools and legacy equipment, connecting cloud data and simulation models,
   and safeguarding cyber-physical security, are discussed. Critical
   challenges and opportunities for practical considerations are

Title = {Communications in the 6G Era},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {57063-57074},
Abstract = {The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G
   deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish
   a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research.
   In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication
   needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of
   connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true
   representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial
   and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical,
   biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will
   shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new
   man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices
   acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among
   multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to
   create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv)
   precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With
   rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to
   become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data,
   compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving
   superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other
   major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i)
   cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the
   integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system
   definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on
   latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms
   involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security
   and privacy schemes.},

   paradigms in the edge are expected to be integrated into power grid
   infrastructures over the coming years. In this sense, AI technologies
   will play a fundamental role to efficiently manage dynamic information
   flows of future applications, which impacts the authorization policies
   applied in such a complex scenario. This article studies how digital
   twins can evolve their context awareness capabilities and simulation
   technologies to anticipate faults or to detect cyber-security issues in
   real time, and update access control policies accordingly. Our study
   analyzes the evolution of monitoring platforms and architecture
   decentralization, including the application of machine learning and
   blockchain technologies in the smart grid, toward the goal of
   implementing autonomous and self-learning agents in the medium and long
   term. We conclude this study with future challenges on applying digital
   twins to B5G-based smart grid deployments.},

Title = {Attacking IEC 61850 Substations by Targeting the PTP Protocol},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Digital substations, also referred to as modern power grid substations,
   utilize the IEC 61850 station and process bus in conjunction with
   IP-based communication. This includes communication with switch yard
   equipment within the substation as well as the dispatch center. IEC
   61850 is a global standard developed to standardize power grid
   communications, covering multiple communication needs related to modern
   power grid substations or digital substations. Unlike the legacy
   communication standards, IEC 60870-5-104 and DNP3, IEC 61850 is
   specifically designed for IP-based communication. It comprises several
   communication models and supports real-time communication by introducing
   the process bus to replace traditional peer-to-peer communication with
   standard network communication between substation equipment and the
   switch yard. The process bus, especially Sampled Measured Values (SMV)
   communication, in modern power grid substations relies on extremely
   accurate and synchronized time to prevent equipment damage, maintain
   power grid system balance, and ensure safety. In IEC 61850, time
   synchronization is provided by the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). This
   paper discusses the significance and challenges of time synchronization
   in IEC 61850 substations, particularly those associated with PTP. It
   presents the results of a controlled experiment that subjects time
   synchronization and PTP to cyber-attacks and discusses the potential
   consequences of such attacks. The paper also provides recommendations
   for potential mitigation strategies. The contribution of this paper is
   to provide insights and recommendations for enhancing the security of
   IEC 61850-based substations against cyber-attacks targeting time
   synchronization. The paper also explores the potential consequences of
   cyber-attacks and provides recommendations for potential mitigation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there have been concentrations on the Digital Twin from
   researchers and companies due to its advancement in IT, communication
   systems, Cloud Computing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Blockchain. The
   main concept of the DT is to provide a comprehensive tangible, and
   operational explanation of any element, asset, or system. However, it is
   an extremely dynamic taxonomy developing in complication during the life
   cycle that produces an enormous quantity of the engendered data and
   information from them. Likewise, with the development of the Blockchain,
   the digital twins have the potential to redefine and could be a key
   strategy to support the IoT-based digital twin's applications for
   transferring data and value onto the Internet with full transparency
   besides promising accessibility, trusted traceability, and immutability
   of transactions. Therefore, the integration of digital twins with the
   IoT and blockchain technologies has the potential to revolutionize
   various industries by providing enhanced security, transparency, and
   data integrity. Thus, this work presents a survey on the innovative
   theme of digital twins with the integration of Blockchain for various
   applications. Also, provides challenges and future research directions
   on this subject. In addition, in this paper, we propose a concept and
   architecture for integrating digital twins with IoT-based blockchain
   archives, which allows for real-time monitoring and control of physical
   assets and processes in a secure and decentralized manner. We also
   discuss the challenges and limitations of this integration, including
   issues related to data privacy, scalability, and interoperability.
   Finally, we provide insights into the future scope of this technology
   and discuss potential research directions for further improving the
   integration of digital twins with IoT-based blockchain archives.
   Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the potential
   benefits and challenges of integrating digital twins with IoT-based
   blockchain and lays the foundation for future research in this area.},

Title = {UAV-Assisted Three-Dimensional Spectrum Mapping Driven by Spectrum Data
   and Channel Model},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As the number of civil aerial vehicles increase explosively, spectrum
   scarcity and security become an increasingly challenge in both the
   airspace and terrestrial space. To address this difficulty, this paper
   presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum
   mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by
   spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction
   algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method
   and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision
   mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a
   three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and
   security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital
   twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the
   proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even
   when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of
   the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with
   the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation
   results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the
   classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the
   tensor completion method by about 12.5\% and 92.3\%, respectively, in
   terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are
   regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.},

Journal = {SOFTWAREX},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing reliance on technology and automation in the maritime
   sector has made it more vul-nerable to cyberattacks. Cyber threats to
   ships and offshore platforms can have serious consequences, including
   accidents leading to loss of life, asset damage, or environmental
   impact. One primary means of countering these threats is developing and
   testing countermeasures tailored to the shipboard infrastructures and
   training the personnel. To this aim, we present MaCySTe, an open-source
   project that provides a testbed reproducing the network infrastructure
   and core components of the onboard cyber-physical systems. As it
   interfaces with ship simulators, it allows for realistic testing and
   training sessions involving cybersecurity and maritime operators. We
   expect that MaCySTe will contribute to fostering cybersecurity
   protection and awareness in this critical sector.\& COPY; 2023 Published

Title = {The Next Generation of eHealth: A Multidisciplinary Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {134623-134646},
Abstract = {Over the past two years, the spread of COVID-19 has spurred the use of
   information and communication technologies (ICT) in aid of healthcare.
   The need to guarantee continuity to care has promoted research and
   industry activities aimed at developing solutions for the digitalization
   of the procedures to be performed to provide health services, even in
   emergency scenarios. Digital collection, transmission, and processing of
   health data represent the starting point for fulfilling this innovation
   process but also bring heterogeneous challenges. These motivations led
   to the elaboration of this work, which analyzes innovative and
   technological tools for the development of digital health (eHealth)
   through the collection of multisectoral literature, produced thanks to
   the cooperation of varied research groups, thus providing a
   multidisciplinary survey. Since digital health is expected to be one of
   the leading applications of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless cellular
   networks, this paper covers the related telecommunications aspects.
   Furthermore, the exploitation of artificial intelligence paradigms to
   elaborate massive amounts of biological data is examined. Given the
   extreme sensitivity of health data, this paper also investigates
   security and privacy issues. In particular, the main techniques and
   approaches to guarantee security properties (i.e., anonymity,
   responsibility, authentication, confidentiality, integrity,
   non-repudiation, and revocability) are studied. Applications involving
   innovative electromagnetic systems for healthcare and assisted living
   services are described to provide an example of an eHealth scenario
   leveraging ICT. Finally, the telemedicine-related regulations of the
   European Commission are analyzed, with particular reference to the
   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).},

Title = {A Survey on Controller Area Network Reverse Engineering},
Journal = {IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1445-1481},
Abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is a masterless serial bus designed and
   widely used for the exchange of mission and time-critical information
   within commercial vehicles. In-vehicle communication is based on
   messages sent and received by Electronic Control Units (ECUs) connected
   to this serial bus network. Although unencrypted, CAN messages are not
   easy to interpret. In fact, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
   attempt to achieve security through obscurity by encoding the data in
   their proprietary format, which is kept secret from the general public.
   As a result, the only way to obtain clear data is to reverse engineer
   CAN messages. Driven by the need for in-vehicle message interpretation,
   which is highly valuable in the automotive industry, researchers and
   companies have been working to make this process automated, fast, and
   standardized. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the
   state of the art and summarize the major advances in CAN bus reverse
   engineering. We are the first to provide a taxonomy of CAN tokenization
   and translation techniques. Based on the reviewed literature, we
   highlight an important issue: the lack of a public and standardized
   dataset for the quantitative evaluation of translation algorithms. In
   response, we define a complete set of requirements for standardizing the
   data collection process. We also investigate the risks associated with
   the automation of CAN reverse engineering, in particular with respect to
   the security network and the safety and privacy of drivers and
   passengers. Finally, we discuss future research directions in CAN
   reverse engineering.},

Journal = {WIRELESS NETWORKS},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Smart factories in harsh large-scale environments are achieved by
   installation of group-based industrial wireless sensor networks
   (GIWSNs), in which a group of sensors are deployed on each machine
   target, for security and saving deployment time. In GIWSNs, enormous
   data for production (e.g., 3D digital twin and automated optical
   inspection images) and surveillance is transmitted frequently among
   multiple machines, and consumes huge energy. Furthermore, a real-world
   factory whose radio environment is interfered by mobile devices is
   dynamic and uncertain. Therefore, this paper investigates reliable
   energy-efficient routing for surveillance in dynamic uncertain GIWSNs,
   and further proposes a fuzzy improved global-best harmony search
   approach, where improved operators are integrated to efficiently explore
   the search space locally and globally; and a fuzzy evaluation scheme is
   employed to address uncertain factors. Through simulation under various
   parameter settings, this approach can find reliable routing in dynamic
   environments, and shows high performance as compared with other
   approaches. In addition, this approach can always find the reliable
   surveillance routing under various data amounts, while activating fewer
   crucial sensors to effectively reduce energy consumption.},

   Food and Essentials During Pandemics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {127190-127219},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply
   chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including
   those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical
   supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials
   increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors
   like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair
   practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of
   lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of
   food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through
   challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and
   contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and
   survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent
   hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the
   system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world
   implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and
   detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in
   using it to serve their communities.},

Abstract = {As an essential part of mobile networks, vehicular ad hoc networks
   (VANETs) are beneficial to the improvement of traffic efficiency and
   safety through real-time information sharing between vehicles. Digital
   Twins (DT) have been utilized to facilitate the design, testing, and
   deployment of VANETs. However, constructing Digital Twins still faces
   interference from malicious vehicles. Despite most vehicles following
   communication rules honestly, the reliability and authenticity of
   traffic messages cannot be guaranteed due to the network's openness and
   vulnerability. Meanwhile, vehicles may suffer tracking attacks during
   the interaction without an effective privacy-preserving method, leading
   to the leakage of sensitive data. To address these issues, a
   decentralized trust management scheme embedded with blockchain that
   considers identity authentication is proposed to detect malicious
   DT-vehicles. In our method, each vehicle in the Digital Twin of VANETs
   (DT-VANETs) is equipped with a certificate recorded on the blockchain as
   a legal identity, which is also served as a pseudonym for security
   during message transmission. The trustworthiness of the vehicle is
   evaluated based on direct trust and recommendation trust. Direct
   interaction between vehicles consists of message authenticity
   verification and active detection, which are the basis of direct trust
   calculation. For other vehicles, these direct trust opinions are treated
   as second-hand information to obtain recommendation trust. Unreliable
   recommendations are filtered by our proposed RTF algorithm, further
   resisting cooperation attacks. Vehicles judged to be malicious will have
   their certificates revoked and removed from DT-VANETs, providing a
   guarantee for the establishment of trust in DT-VANETs. Experimental
   results show that the proposed scheme can effectively resist malicious
   attacks in DT-VANETs.},

Abstract = {There is a combinatorial explosion of alternative variants of an
   assembly design owing to the design freedom provided by additive
   manufacturing (AM). In this regard, a novel virtual reality-based
   decision-support framework is presented herein for extracting the
   superior assembly design to be fabricated by AM route. It specifically
   addresses the intersection between human assembly and AM hence combining
   design for assembly, and design for additive manufacturing using
   axiomatic design theory. Several virtual reality experiments were
   carried out to achieve this with human subjects assembling parts. At
   first, a two-dimensional table is assembled, and the data are used to
   confirm the independence of non-functional requirements such as assembly
   time and assembly displacement error according to independence axiom.
   Then this approach is demonstrated on an industrial lifeboat hook with
   three assembly design variations. The data from these experiments are
   utilized to evaluate the possible combinations of the assembly in terms
   of probability density based on the information axiom. The technique
   effectively identifies the assembly design most likely to fulfill the
   non-functional requirements. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the
   first study that numerically extracts the human aspect of design at an
   early design stage in the decision process and considers the selection
   of the superior assembly design in a detailed design stage. Finally,
   this process is automated using a graphical user interface, which
   embraces the practicality of the currently integrated framework and
   enables manufacturers to choose the best assembly design.},

Title = {Supporting Digital Twins for the Retrofit in Aviation by a Model-Driven
   Data Handling},
Journal = {SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aviation is characterized by many stakeholders, long lifespans of its
   assets, and high requirements regarding safety, security, and
   documentation. To meet these requirements as well as customer needs,
   aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins. During the planning
   and execution of this cabin retrofit, handling the needed and available
   data poses a challenge to the engineers. While much of the required data
   is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally
   usable dataset of the specific aircraft-a virtual representation of the
   physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a
   digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an
   approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique
   circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The
   methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data
   science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively
   creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant
   data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed
   information. Besides the presentation of the research background and the
   methodology, a simplified example is shown, demonstrating the approach
   using abstracted but realistic information provided by partners from the
   industry.},

Abstract = {With the large-scale commercial launch of fifth generation (5G) mobile
   network, the development of new services and applications catering to
   the year 2030, along with the deep convergence of information,

   experiences from 5G practice will drive the evolution of the next
   generation of mobile networks. This article surveys the history and
   driving forces of the evolution of the mobile network architecture and
   proposes a logical function architecture for sixth generation (6G)
   mobile network. The proposed 6G network architecture is termed SOLIDS
   (related to the following basic features: soft, on-demand fulfillment,
   lite, native intelligence, digital twin, and native security), which can
   support self-generation, self-healing, self-evolution, and self-immunity
   without human involvement and address the primary issues in the legacy

   perspective and expert opinion},
Journal = {ANNALS OF MEDICINE},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to impact all
   facets of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, including disease
   assessment, treatment decisions, discovery and development of new
   biomarkers and therapeutics, as well as clinician-patient communication.
   Areas covered: This perspective paper provides an overview of the
   application of AI in the clinical management of IBD through a review of
   the currently available AI models that could be potential tools for
   prognosis, shared decision-making, and precision medicine. This overview
   covers models that measure treatment response based on statistical or
   machine-learning methods, or a combination of the two. We briefly
   discuss a computational model that allows integration of
   immune/biological system knowledge with mathematical modeling and also
   involves a `digital twin', which allows measurement of temporal trends
   in mucosal inflammatory activity for predicting treatment response. A
   viewpoint on AI-enabled wearables and nearables and their use to improve
   IBD management is also included.
   Expert opinion: Although challenges regarding data quality, privacy, and
   security; ethical concerns; technical limitations; and regulatory
   barriers remain to be fully addressed, a growing body of evidence
   suggests a tremendous potential for integration of AI into daily
   clinical practice to enable precision medicine and shared
   decision-making.},

Title = {A Systematic Literature Review on RAMS analysis for critical
   infrastructures protection},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Safety/Security (RAMS)
   analysis of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) can be applied to investigate
   their performance subjected to failure modes. The literature has
   witnessed earlier research approaches to RAM analysis. However, the
   integration of cybersecurity or safety aspects, along with the RAM to
   develop RAMS analysis methods, tools, and models, is a significant
   aspect for protecting CIs as their digitalization is progressing. In
   recent times, digital components and systems com-prising information and
   communication technologies, smart devices, efficient gateways, faster
   protocols have transformed the CIs. This transformation comes with a
   considerable cost, such as the necessity to in-tegrate innovative
   cyber-defense measures and policies due to new vulnerabilities,
   efficient maintenance strategies, risk management scenario development,
   resilience with self-healing architecture. Nevertheless, the current
   knowledge body lacks an up-to-date Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
   focused on address-ing integrated protection aspects, recent
   developments, and evaluation criteria towards RAMS analysis for CIs.
   Accordingly, this study aims to provide a comprehensive SLR on existing
   studies dealing with devel-oping techniques, methodologies, protocols,
   models, and RAMS analysis tools for different applications. This SLR
   followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. 1513 records published between
   2011 and 2020 are initially identified, which are later screened to 212
   records to be considered for the eligibility check process. Finally,
   after examining the exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 19
   articles are included in this research. In this SLR, a com-parative
   analysis of existing solutions based on included studies is presented in
   different aspects such as developed architectures and methodologies,
   performance evaluation mechanisms, implementation scenar-ios, targeted
   applications, pros and cons, and applied CIs protection aspects
   associated with RAMS. The findings suggest that RAMS analysis for CIs is
   an emerging research area, with currently focused appli-cations
   including power grid stations, Cyber-Physical Systems, cloud computing,
   maritime transportation, and Industrial Control Systems. 36.8\% of the
   studies have performed a real-time implementation, while the remaining
   approaches have either performed simulation or preliminary analysis.
   Also, 84.2\% of the included studies focus on integrating only three
   aspects of CIs protection. Finally, the open research chal-lenges and
   limitations of existing studies and their respective emerging solutions
   are presented.

Abstract = {Today's power systems are seeing a paradigm shift under the energy
   transition, sparkled by the electrification of demand, digitalisation of
   systems, and an increasing share of decarbonated power generation. Most
   of these changes have a direct impact on their control centers, forcing
   them to handle weather-based energy resources, new interconnections with
   neighbouring transmission networks, more markets, active distribution
   networks, micro-grids, and greater amounts of available data.
   Unfortunately, these changes have translated during the past decade to
   small, incremental changes, mostly centered on hardware, software, and
   human factors. We assert that more transformative changes are needed,
   especially regarding human-centered design approaches, to enable control
   room operators to manage the future power system. This paper discusses
   the evolution of operators towards continuous operation planners,
   monitoring complex time horizons thanks to adequate real-time
   automation. Reviewing upcoming challenges as well as emerging
   technologies for power systems, we present our vision of a new
   evolutionary architecture for control centers, both at back-end and
   frontend levels. We propose a unified hypervision scheme based on
   structured decision-making concepts, providing operators with proactive,
   collaborative, and effective decision support.},

Abstract = {The effective and accurate modeling of human performance is one of the
   key technologies in virtual/smart manufacturing systems. However, a
   significant challenge lies in acquiring sufficient data for such
   modeling. Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a promising solution, making
   human manufacturing experiments more practical and accessible. In this
   paper, we present a novel framework that efficiently models human
   assembly duration by leveraging VR to prototype data-acquisition systems
   for assembly tasks. Central to the framework is an active learning
   model, which intelligently selects experimental conditions to yield the
   most informative results, effectively reducing the number of experiments
   required. As a result, the system demands fewer experimental trials and
   operates on an automated basis. In VR experiments involving throughput
   rate, the active model significantly reduces the data requirement,
   thereby expediting the experiment and modeling process. While this
   framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency, it does exhibit
   sensitivity to non-constant noise and may necessitate prior data from
   similar assembly tasks to identify high-noise. Notably, this proposed
   method extends beyond manufacturing, allowing the quick generation of
   human performance models in virtual systems and enhancing experiment
   scalability across various fields. With its potential to revolutionize
   human performance modeling, our framework represents a promising avenue
   for advancing virtual/smart manufacturing systems and other related
   applications.},

Abstract = {With the continuous evolution of emerging technologies such as mobile
   network, machine learning (ML), 5G, etc., digital twins (DT) bursts out
   great potential by its capacity of data analysis, data tracking, data
   prediction, etc, building a bridge between the physical and information
   world. Meanwhile, mobile network is moving towards data-driven paradigm,
   the issue of data privacy and data security seem to be a bottleneck. As
   a result, federated learning (FL) and mobile network are deeply
   converging. However, the mobile network is time-varying and the
   parameters of FL-empowered mobile network is huge and continue to
   increase with exponential growth of wireless terminals, result in the
   failure of traditional modeling. In the mobile networks, DT is conducive
   to prototyping, testing, and optimization, enabling mobile networks to
   be modelled more efficiently in a virtual environment and thus providing
   guidance for practical application. To this end, a
   communication-assisted sensing scenario is considered in this paper with
   FL in DT-empowered mobile networks. More specifically, two
   communication-assisted sensing architectures are proposed to improve
   communication efficiency of mobile network, namely, centralized
   architecture of federated transfer learning (FTL) and decentralized
   architecture of FTL. For centralized architecture of FTL, feature
   extraction of sensing information is conducted by FL between partial
   nodes and central server while the remaining nodes are used to train the

Title = {FL-CTIF: A federated learning based CTI framework based on information
   fusion for secure IIoT},
Journal = {INFORMATION FUSION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {102},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are evolving and transitioning into
   virtual entities supported by digital twin technology to optimize
   existing processes further and improve their efficiency. The virtual
   representation of the several IIoT departments, such as manufacturing
   process, packaging, warehousing, and logistics enables predictive
   maintenance for optimizing local material resources for manufacturing
   and packaging, improved warehouse space allocation, and delivery
   schedule optimization. The high volume of data generated from IoT
   devices are exposed to cyber-attacks using modern attack vectors and
   thus threaten both physical IIoT environment and its digital twins.
   Existing intrusion detection systems focus on identifying anomalous
   traffic using obsolete knowledge of cyber-attack patterns for several
   attacks, such as ARP poisoning man-in-the-middle attacks, SSLbased
   attacks using encrypted traffic, and DNS flood-based DDoS traffic. A
   lack of focus on security using updated and comprehensive Cyber Threat
   Intelligence (CTI) threatens the security of the IIoT environment. In
   this paper, we present a Federated Learning based CTI framework based on
   Information Fusion (FL-CTIF) for securing IIoT environments. We design a
   comprehensive cyberattack dataset with updated feature selection using
   Information Fusion to improve the accuracy in identifying cyber-attacks.
   A federated learning-based ANN model is designed to reduce the model
   training rounds based on satisfaction level and measure the absence of
   improvement in each attack vector's average accuracy. The model is
   evaluated based on model aggregation performance and demonstrates an
   improved F1 score based on reduced training rounds and reduced CPU
   consumption. The federated learning model improves accuracy and reduces
   the false positive rate using the newly merged dataset compared to
   existing research.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey on information
   integration (II) in space informatics. With an ever-increasing scale and
   dynamics of complex space systems, II has become essential in dealing
   with the complexity, changes, dynamics, and uncertainties of space
   systems. The applications of space II (SII) require addressing some
   distinctive functional requirements (FRs) of heterogeneity, networking,
   communication, security, latency, and resilience; while limited works
   are available to examine recent advances of SII thoroughly. This survey
   helps to gain the understanding of the state of the art of SII in sense
   that (1) technical drivers for SII are discussed and classified; (2)
   existing works in space system development are analyzed in terms of
   their contributions to space economy, divisions, activities, and
   missions; (3) enabling space information technologies are explored at
   aspects of sensing, communication, networking, data analysis, and system
   integration; (4) the importance of first-time right (FTR) for
   implementation of a space system is emphasized, the limitations of
   digital twin (DT-I) as technological enablers are discussed, and a
   concept digital-triad (DT-II) is introduced as an information platform
   to overcome these limitations with a list of fundamental design
   principles; (5) the research challenges and opportunities are discussed
   to promote SII and advance space informatics in future.},

   Transform for IIoT},

Abstract = {In the era of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), huge amounts of data
   are generated, which contains sensitive information. Therefore, how to
   protect data security is an important challenge in the development of
   IIoT. To this end, we propose a duple color image encryption method for
   IIoT. Different from the traditional algorithm that encrypts one plain
   image into one ciphertext image, our algorithm encrypts two color images
   into one color ciphertext image which can cause great confusion to the
   attacker who illegally breaks the ciphertext image. First, the proposed
   algorithm converts two color images with N xM into a 3-D bit-level
   matrix with N xM x 48. Next, 3-D nonequilateral Arnold transform
   (3D-NEAT) is applied to permutate the positions of the elements of the
   resulted 3-D bit-level matrix. Then, the permutated 3-D bit-level matrix
   is transformed into three 2-D pixel-level images and then diffused by
   the random diffusion sequences that 3-D Lorenz system (3D-LS) generates.
   Finally, the scrambling matrices generated by 3D-LS are used to scramble
   three diffused 2-D pixel-level images, and the output is considered as
   three color components of the encrypted image. The numerical experiments
   and security analyses show that the proposed image encryption scheme has
   strong resistance to several known attacks, and yields near-zero
   correlation and neareight entropy for the RGB cipher image, and its
   performance is better than some of the recently proposed image
   encryption algorithms.},

Journal = {GEODERMA REGIONAL},

Volume = {24},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment (DSMA) has progressed from
   challenging traditional soil science paradigms, through small scale
   prototyping, to large-scale implementation capturing quantitative
   measures of soil attributes and functions. This paper considers the
   future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where
   high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding
   to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is
   for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided
   from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as
   a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a
   strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory,
   tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore
   expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of
   base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and
   forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer
   spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly
   globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of
   DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis
   of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to
   provide the background to a soil and landscape `digital twin' and the
   consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of
   land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA
   skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice
   involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools.
   Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of
   public-private partnerships in this development and application. (C)

Abstract = {Aerodynamic noise of High-Lift Devices (HLDs) is one of the main sources
   of airframe noise, and has immediate impacts on the airworthiness
   certification, environmental protection and security of commercial
   aircraft. In this study, a novel hybrid method is proposed for the
   aerodynamic noise prediction of HLD. A negative Spalart-Allmaras (S-A)
   turbulence model based Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES)
   method coupling with AFT-2017b transition model is developed, in order
   to elaborately simulate the complex flow field around the HLD and thus
   obtain the information of acoustic sources. A Farassat-Kirchhoff hybrid
   method is devel-oped to filter the spurious noise sources caused by the
   vortex motions in solving the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) equation
   with permeable integral surfaces, and accurately predict the far-field
   noise radiation of the HLD. The results of the 30P30N HLD indicate that,
   the computational Sound Pressure Levels (SPLs) obtained by the
   Farassat-Kirchhoff hybrid method conform well with the experimental ones
   in the spectrum for the given observation point, and are more accurate
   than those obtained by the Farassat 1A method. Based on the hybrid
   method, the acoustic directivity of the HLD of a commercial aircraft is
   obtained, and the variation of the SPLs in the spectrum with the
   deflection angle of the slat is analyzed.(c) 2023 Production and hosting

Title = {Using NFTs for ownership management of digital twins and for proof of

Journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {1-17},

Abstract = {A digital twin (DT) is an exact digital replica of a physical world
   object or asset that aids in managing, controlling, or monitoring the
   real object. The current systems used for managing DTs are centralized
   and not easily accessible. Typically, a DT is built by the original
   equipment manufacturer (OEM) and becomes hard to access and manage once
   its physical asset is transported or sold to a new owner. Moreover, a
   physical asset or object is typically comprised of many other physical
   sub-components. This translates to having one DT comprised of other
   sub-DTs. In this paper, we show how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be
   used to manage ownership of DTs and to provide proof of delivery (PoD)
   of their associated physical assets in a decentralized, secure,
   traceable, and transparent manner. Specifically, we propose, implement,
   and evaluate a solution to manage DTs and their sub-DTs using NFTs and
   sub-NFTs. The DTs and their sub-DTs are represented in a hierarchical
   way, whereby a sub-NFT maps to a sub-DT along with its physical object.
   We present the system architecture and design, as well as the
   implementation of algorithms and smart contracts along with thorough
   testing and validation details. We present the security analysis as well
   as discuss the generalization aspect of the proposed solution. All
   developed smart contract codes are made publicly available on GitHub.(c)

Title = {Educational 5G Edge Computing: Framework and Experimental Study},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Benefiting from the large-scale commercial use of 5G, smart campuses
   have attracted increasing research attention in recent years and are
   expected to revolutionize traditional campus activities. However, there
   are some obstacles that hinder the practical deployment of MEC
   (multi-access edge computing). First, traditional information
   infrastructures on campus cannot support latency-sensitive and
   computing-intensive smart applications, such as AR/VR, live interactive
   lectures and digital twin experiments. In addition, the mixture of old
   and new applications, isolated data islands and heterogeneous equipment
   management introduce more challenges. Moreover, the existing MEC
   framework proposed by ETSI and 3GPP cannot meet the specific deployment
   requirements of smart campuses, e.g., educational data security,
   real-time interactive applications, heterogeneous connections, and
   others. In this paper, we propose a 5G-based architecture for smart
   education information infrastructure; a new dedicated cloud architecture
   eMEC (educational multi-access edge computing) is defined. It consists
   of a UGW (universal access gateway) and an eMEP (educational
   multi-access edge computing platform), making it possible to satisfy
   education-specific requirements and long-term evolution. Furthermore, we
   implement the framework and conduct real-world field tests for eMEC in a
   university campus. Based on the framework and practical field tests, we
   also conduct a measurement study to unveil the spatial-temporal
   characteristics of mobile users in the smart campus and discuss
   exploiting them for better network performance. The experimental results
   show that the system achieves satisfactory performance in terms of both
   throughput and latency.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Innovative testing and validation methods are prerequisites concerning
   Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM), as the high

   increase the probability of adverse safety and security incidents. The
   proposed new approaches deal with this increasing complexity of not

   introduces a novel, mathematical model based, scenario identification
   methodology, facilitating the selection of critical road vehicle traffic
   scenarios, taking into account different testing objectives, such as
   maximizing the safety risk of the analyzed system. The presented results
   verify that applying specific decision models and quantifiable
   indicators related to the system elements of highly automated mobility
   systems can significantly contribute to the systematic identification of
   unsafe corner cases in connected and cooperative autonomous systems.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in
   Internet of Things (IoT) not only threatens the security of digital
   devices and infrastructure but also severely degrades IoT system
   performance due to the overly consumed network resources. With the
   knowledge of identity information of devices and signaling data,
   Internet service providers (ISPs) can detect and block DDoS traffic by
   monitoring the upstream IoT packets, and thereby, improve network
   efficiency. However, inspecting all data packets online for DDoS
   detection will significantly increase both the network delay and the
   computational overhead. Therefore, the packet sampling strategy is
   crucial for the defenders to detect DDoS attacks. To this end, this
   article formulates a Stackelberg game model to analyze the collaborative
   IoT packet sampling against DDoS attacks. Through the equilibrium
   analysis of the DDoS game, we derive the lower bound of packet sampling
   rate (PSR) that can effectively deter potential attackers. Unlike
   traditional offline detection, our proposed packet sampling strategy can
   support both the online detection and proactive prevention of DDoS
   traffic. As a use case, a multipoint DDoS defense framework is developed
   to address the IP spoofing in 5G networks based on the proposed packet
   sampling strategy, which deters DDoS attacks and reduces the packet
   sampling cost, and thereby, maximizes the IoT utility, compared with
   existing methods. In typical reflection attacks (in which no more than
   five packets of response are triggered by a request packet), our
   proposed scheme not only reduces more than 70\% of the sampling rate but
   also demonstrates superior robustness against boundary condition
   variation.},

Abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has advanced digital technology
   and the fastest interconnection, which creates opportunities to
   substantially grow industrial businesses today. Although IIoT provides
   promising opportunities for growth, the massive sensor IoT data
   collected are easily attacked by cyber criminals. Hence, IIoT requires
   different high security levels to protect the network. An Intrusion
   Detection System (IDS) is one of the crucial security solutions, which
   aims to detect the network's abnormal behavior and monitor safe network
   traffic to avoid attacks. In particular, the effectiveness of the
   Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS approach to building a secure IDS
   application is attracting the security research community in both the
   general cyber network and the specific IIoT network. However, most
   available IIoT datasets contain multiclass output data with imbalanced
   distributions. This is the main reason for the reduction in the
   detection accuracy of attacks of the ML-based IDS model. This research
   proposes an IDS for IIoT imbalanced datasets by applying the eXtremely
   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to overcome this issue. Two modern
   IIoT imbalanced datasets were used to assess our proposed method's
   effectiveness and robustness, X-IIoTDS and TON\_IoT. The XGBoost model
   achieved excellent attack detection with F1 scores of 99.9\% and 99.87\%
   on the two datasets. This result demonstrated that the proposed approach
   improved the detection attack performance in imbalanced multiclass IIoT
   datasets and was superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

Abstract = {The Central Asian area is confronted with a number of acute obstacles as
   it attempts to transition to a long-term electrical power supply.
   Small-scale hydropower systems may be a viable answer to these problems.
   Central Asian nations' hydropower resources are allocated unevenly.
   Regardless, it remains the most exploitable renewable energy source in
   the area, with both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan possessing some of the
   world's highest hydropower potential. Nonetheless, for fossil-fuel-rich
   nations like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan, hydropower will
   play a significant role in the future energy balance. Furthermore,
   because rivers often run across many boundaries, water security plays an
   important role in cross-border relations between Central Asian
   countries. To achieve effective exploitation of small hydropower
   potential, technological and financial expen-ditures are needed to
   improve the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of diverse hydroelectric
   equipment by increasing lifetime, improving efficiency, and increasing
   yearly power output. Several of these issues can be resolved by
   installing small and micro hydropower plants in the many minor rivers
   and irrigation canals. A pumped hydro energy storage system should also
   be tested and certified for better usability. A hydrological digital
   twin of relevant river system and irrigation network should be
   constructed to increase the understanding for performance and enable
   system-level improvement. Furthermore, optimal performance necessitates
   constant monitoring of the network, necessitating the development of
   intelligent monitoring employing sensors in conjunction with control
   systems and smart grid interactions. This review focuses on the broad
   and efficient use of these existing resources, which are still
   underutilized.},

Title = {A structure-preserving neural differential operator with embedded

Abstract = {Data-driven machine learning models are useful for modeling complex
   structures based on empirical observations, bypassing the need to
   generate a physical model where the physics is not well known or
   otherwise difficult to model. One disadvantage of purely data-driven
   approaches is that they tend to perform poorly in regions outside the
   original training domain. To mitigate this limitation, physical
   knowledge about the structure can be embedded in the neural network
   architecture. For large-scale systems, relevant physical properties such
   as the system state matrices may be expensive to compute. One way around
   this problem is to use scalar functionals, such as energy, to constrain
   the network to operate within physical bounds. We propose a neural
   network framework based on Hamiltonian mechanics to enforce a
   physics-informed structure to the model. The Hamiltonian framework
   allows us to relate the energy of the system to the measured quantities
   through the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. In this work, the
   potential, kinetic energy, and Rayleigh damping terms are each modeled
   with a multilayer perceptron. Auto-differentiation is used to compute
   partial derivatives and assemble the relevant equations. The network
   incorporates a numerics-informed loss function via the residual of a
   multi-step integration term for deployment as a neural differential
   operator. Our approach incorporates a physics-constrained autoencoder to
   perform coordinate transformation between measured and generalized
   coordinates. This approach results in a physics-informed,
   structure-preserving model of the structure that can form the basis of a
   digital twin for many applications. The technique is demonstrated on
   computational examples.},

Abstract = {The papers in this special section focus on the topic of green
   industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These papers aim to consolidate
   the current state of the art in terms of fundamental research ideas and
   network engineering, geared toward exploiting greenness of IIoT. The
   IIoT is a new ecosystem that combines intelligent and autonomous
   machines, advanced predictive analytics, and machine-human collaboration
   to improve productivity, efficiency, and reliability. IIoT connects
   billions of mobile digital devices, manufacturing machines, industrial
   equipment, etc., and generates an unprecedented volume of industrial
   data. The gap between the rapidly growing demands of data rate and
   existing bandwidth-limited network infrastructures has become ever
   prominent. Moreover, the interaction and connection of things in IIoT
   will consume substantial energy in contrast with limited energy storage
   of the things. Therefore, the greenness of IIoT is crucial for the
   success of IIoT. In particular, with the prevalence of mobile devices,
   electronic devices, cameras, social networks, social media, etc.,
   ourworld is generating big data and multimedia big data, which further
   aggregate the energy demand in terms of the data transmission and

Title = {The Extraction of Foreground Regions of the Moving Objects Based on
   Spatio-Temporal Information under a Static Camera},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The rapid development of computer vision technology provides a basic
   guarantee for public security reliance on video surveillance. In current
   video surveillance based on static cameras, accurate and quick
   extractions of foreground regions of moving objects enable quicker
   analysis of the behavior of meaningful objects and thus improve the
   intelligent analysis level of video surveillance. However, there would
   always occur false detection in the extraction of foreground regions,
   because of the shaking of tree branches and leaves in the scene and the
   ``ghosting{''} area caused by the delayed updating of the background
   model. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method for the
   extraction of foreground regions by using spatio-temporal information.
   This method can accurately extract foreground regions of moving objects
   by utilizing the difference and complementarity between spatial domain
   methods and temporal domain methods and further in combination with
   image processing technology. Specifically, the foreground regions of
   moving objects can be extracted by the morphological processing of the
   combination of the spatial information and the morphologically processed
   temporal information in the video. The experimental results show that
   the proposed method for the extraction of foreground regions of moving
   objects in view of the spatio-temporal information can reduce false
   detections caused by the shaking of tree branches and leaves, and thus
   effectively extract foreground regions of moving objects.},

Title = {Interoperability between BIM and FEM for vibration-based model updating
   of a pedestrian bridge},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {1092-1107},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Finite Element Model (FEM) updating is the procedure of minimizing
   errors between the experimental measurements and response simulated by
   FEMs. It can lead to more accurate and representative models useful to
   perform forecast analysis or detect initial damage thresholds for
   structures and infrastructure. The paper investigates the potentialities
   to carry out an automatic model updating through the interoperability
   between FEMs, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and experimentally
   vibration-based information. Indeed, these latter possess details and
   data (geometrical or mechanical) that could be automatically transferred
   in a numerical environment for structural modeling. The ability of this
   exchange is assessed by a methodology applied to a pedestrian walkway.
   The first path utilizes the geometrical data coming from a BIM model of
   the walkway to achieve three different levels of meshing. Consequently,
   three accurate finite element modeling have been pursued based on the
   achieved discretization. For each model, the accuracy and cost analysis
   has been evaluated considering the minimal distance between the main
   experimental modal parameters, identified from output-only dynamic
   tests, and the numerical ones, obtained after manual model updating.
   Additionally, a second path attempts to realize an automatic model
   updating through a simplified representative numerical system of the
   walkway implemented in Matlab. To this end, first, an opportune
   algorithm has been developed capable of processing the data and
   information from both BIM and experimental identification. Second, once
   the numerical model is realized, the potentiality of a modified Particle
   Swarm Optimization for improving the structural representativeness has
   been assessed. In particular, the usefulness of this approach could be
   related to a smart management system of the structures and
   infrastructure through a corresponding digital twin model.},

Title = {Big Data Analysis for Sustainable Agriculture on a Geospatial Cloud
   Framework},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Humanity is confronted with the grand challenge of how to increase
   agricultural production to achieve food security during the 21st century
   and feed a population that is expected to grow to 10 billion people.
   This needs to be done while maintaining sustainable agricultural systems
   and simultaneously facing challenges such as a changing climate,
   depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion
   and loss of productivity due to the occurrence of extreme weather
   events. Precision Agriculture emerged out of the advances in the 1980s
   because of the development of several key technologies like GPS and
   satellite imagery. This paper argues that with the increasing impact of
   climate change, the next revolution in precision agriculture and
   agriculture in general will be driven by Sustainable Precision
   Agriculture and Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs), which could
   leverage past technologies combined with Big Data analysis. This new,
   technology-focused SPAE transitions from a site-specific management
   focus to the notion of global sustainability. To accomplish this
   transition, we introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing
   principle that connects local, site-specific data generators called
   smart farms to a regional and global view of agriculture that can
   support both the agricultural industry and policymakers in government.
   This will help integrate databases located in networks of networks into
   a system of systems to achieve the needed SPAE management and connect
   field, watershed, national, and worldwide sustainability. Automation and
   the use of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT),
   drones, robots, and Big Data serve as a basis for a global ``Digital
   Twin,{''} which will contribute to the development of site-specific
   conservation and management practices that will increase incomes and
   global sustainability of agricultural systems.},

Title = {Toward Metaverse of everything: Opportunities, challenges, and future
   directions of the next generation of visual/virtual communications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {217},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The emergence of Metaverse, a digital environment built on Web 3.0
   technologies, has garnered significant attention from various industries
   and fields, including science and technology. This technology offers the
   potential to create virtual versions of physical objects, resulting in a
   digital twin (DT) of the physical world. This paper aims to explore the
   Metaverse-based Internet of everything (IoE), which we have termed the
   Metaverse of everything (MoE), as a three-dimensional (3D) virtual
   communication and relationship platform. The MoE includes Web 3.0
   components, generated data, virtual individuals called Metaversians, and
   all virtual things in Metaverse, forming a comprehensive network of
   interconnected entities. Our research suggests that Metaverse will
   become increasingly popular, with the virtual world incorporating more
   aspects of the physical world. We have conducted a SWOT (Strengths -
   Weaknesses - Opportunities - Threats) analysis of the MoE concept and
   have identified several opportunities and challenges. Finally, we
   propose potential future directions for MoE that academic researchers,
   industry owners, and IT leaders can pursue. In particular, we suggest
   the implementation of a new service called Metaverse-as-a-creator (MaaC)
   based on an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Metaverse as a
   significant achievement in future Internet-based communication.},

Title = {Experts and intelligent systems for smart homes' Transformation to
   Sustainable Smart Cities: A comprehensive review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},

Abstract = {In this constantly evolving landscape of urbanization, the relationship
   between technology and automation, in regards to sustainability, holds
   immense significance. The intricate strands of human intelligence are
   seamlessly interwoven with the fabric of technological progress, giving
   rise to exquisite patterns of synergy and collaborative innovation.
   Automation is just another step in this process which started with the
   industrial revolution and now has paved way towards urbanization. Smart
   homes or home automation is a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) based
   automation that has added into the comfort, ease, and quality of our
   living standards and is now being integrated to form the concept of
   Smart Cities. In the past decade, various techniques and processes of
   smart home automation have been proposed and implemented. To extend and
   translate the existing methods into new one, the understanding of the
   former is imperative to the research procedure. This review stands as a
   comprehensive exploration, diving into the pivotal role of intelligent
   systems and expert knowledge in driving the transformation of smart
   homes into sustainable smart cities. By meticulously analyzing and
   aggregating an array of contemporary techniques used in smart homes,
   this paper offers profound contributions to the intersection of urban
   evolution and technological innovation. The review's holistic approach
   not only facilitates a deep understanding of smart homes' contributions
   but also charts a course for innovative strategies in city planning,
   infrastructure, and technological integration. In bridging the gap
   between technology and sustainable urban development, this exploration
   underscores the transformative power of leveraging smart home techniques
   to lay the foundation for harmonious and forward-thinking smart cities.
   The technologies cover a wide range of methodologies and intelligent
   systems used for communication, security and management in an urban
   infrastructure. The paper focuses on analysis of the technology to
   provide an outlook into achieving the goal of sustainable smart cities
   and deal with challenges like scalability and big data computation. Our
   comprehensive analysis yields a holistic set of technology comparisons
   and illuminates the promising future prospects within this domain. The
   information is highly insightful in creating a bigger picture for
   adopting state of the art technologies like Federated Learning (FL),
   Digital Twin and Embedded Edge computing in better planning and
   infrastructure management in smart cities. These findings offer reliable
   and potent methods to chart not only the course of research but also to
   enhance these technologies for the betterment of mankind's convenience
   and advancement.},

Title = {The Hitchhiker's Guide to Fused Twins: A Review of Access to Digital
   Twins In Situ in Smart Cities},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Smart Cities already surround us, and yet they are still
   incomprehensibly far from directly impacting everyday life. While
   current Smart Cities are often inaccessible, the experience of everyday
   citizens may be enhanced with a combination of the emerging technologies
   Digital Twins (DTs) and Situated Analytics. DTs represent their Physical
   Twin (PT) in the real world via models, simulations, (remotely) sensed
   data, context awareness, and interactions. However, interaction requires
   appropriate interfaces to address the complexity of the city.
   Ultimately, leveraging the potential of Smart Cities requires going
   beyond assembling the DT to be comprehensive and accessible. Situated
   Analytics allows for the anchoring of city information in its spatial
   context. We advance the concept of embedding the DT into the PT through
   Situated Analytics to form Fused Twins (FTs). This fusion allows access
   to data in the location that it is generated in in an embodied context
   that can make the data more understandable. Prototypes of FTs are
   rapidly emerging from different domains, but Smart Cities represent the
   context with the most potential for FTs in the future. This paper
   reviews DTs, Situated Analytics, and Smart Cities as the foundations of
   FTs. Regarding DTs, we define five components (physical, data,
   analytical, virtual, and Connection Environments) that we relate to
   several cognates (i.e., similar but different terms) from existing
   literature. Regarding Situated Analytics, we review the effects of user
   embodiment on cognition and cognitive load. Finally, we classify
   existing partial examples of FTs from the literature and address their
   construction from Augmented Reality, Geographic Information Systems,
   Building/City Information Models, and DTs and provide an overview of
   future directions.},

Abstract = {The digital transformation (DT) is the acquiring the digital tool,
   techniques, approaches, mechanism etc. for the transformation of the
   business, applications, services and upgrading the manual process into
   the automation. The DT enable the efficacy of the system via automation,
   innovation, creativities. The another concept of DT in the engineering
   domain is to replace the manual and/or conventional process by means of
   automation to handle the big-data problems in an efficient way and
   harness the static/dynamic system information without knowing the system
   parameters. The DT represents the both opportunities and challenges to
   the developer and/or user in an organization, such as development and
   adaptation of new tool and technique in the system and society with
   respect to the various applications (i.e., digital twin, cybersecurity,
   condition monitoring and fault detection \& diagnosis (FDD), forecasting
   and prediction, intelligent data analytics, healthcare monitoring,
   feature extraction and selection, intelligent manufacturing and
   production, future city, advanced construction, resilient
   infrastructure, greater sustainability etc.). Additionally, due to high
   impact of advanced artificial intelligent, machine learning and data
   analytics techniques, the harness of the profit of the DT is increased
   globally. Therefore, the integration of DT into all areas deliver a
   value to the both users as well as developer. In this editorial
   fifty-two different applications of DT of distinct engineering domains
   are presented, which includes its detailed information,
   state-of-the-art, methodology, proposed approach development,
   experimental and/or emulation-based performance demonstration and
   finally conclusive summary of the developed tool/technique along with
   the future scope.},

Abstract = {To realize high-accuracy physical-cyber digital twin (DT) mapping in a
   manufacturing system, a huge amount of data need to be collected and
   analyzed in real-time. Traditional DTs systems are deployed in cloud or
   edge servers independently, whilst it is hard to apply in real
   production systems due to the high interaction or execution delay. This
   results in a low consistency in the temporal dimension of the
   physical-cyber model. In this work, we propose a novel efficient
   edge-cloud DT manufacturing system, which is inspired by resource
   scheduling technology. Specifically, an edge-cloud collaborative DTs
   system deployment architecture is first constructed. Then, deterministic
   and uncertainty optimization adaptive strategies are presented to choose
   a more powerful server for running DT-based applications. We model the
   adaptive optimization problems as dynamic programming problems and
   propose a novel collaborative clustering parallel Q-learning (CCPQL)
   algorithm and prediction-based CCPQL to solve the problems. The proposed
   approach reduces the total delay with a higher convergence rate.
   Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the approach,
   which would have great potential in dynamic and complex industrial
   internet environments.},

Title = {Towards DevOps for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs): Resilient
   Self-Adaptive Software for Sustainable Human-Centric Smart CPS
   Facilitated by Digital Twins},
Journal = {MACHINES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Industrial Revolution drives the digitization of society and
   industry, entailing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that form ecosystems
   where system owners and third parties share responsibilities within and
   across industry domains. Such ecosystems demand smart CPSs that
   continuously align their architecture and governance to the concerns of
   various stakeholders, including developers, operators, and users. In
   order to satisfy short- and long-term stakeholder concerns in a
   continuously evolving operational context, this work proposes
   self-adaptive software models that promote DevOps for smart CPS. Our
   architectural approach extends to the embedded system layer and utilizes
   embedded and interconnected Digital Twins to manage change effectively.
   Experiments conducted on industrial embedded control units demonstrate
   the approach's effectiveness in achieving sub-millisecond real-time
   closed-loop control of CPS assets and the simultaneous high-fidelity
   twinning (i.e., monitoring) of asset states. In addition, the
   experiments show practical support for the adaptation and evolution of
   CPS through the dynamic reconfiguring and updating of real-time control
   services and communication links without downtime. The evaluation
   results conclude that, in particular, the embedded Digital Twins can
   enhance CPS smartness by providing service-oriented access to CPS data,
   monitoring, adaptation, and control capabilities. Furthermore, the
   embedded Digital Twins can facilitate the seamless integration of these
   capabilities into current and future industrial service ecosystems. At
   the same time, these capabilities contribute to implementing emerging
   industrial services such as remote asset monitoring, commissioning, and
   maintenance.},

Abstract = {The next step of digital development is the metaverse, which has the
   potential to drastically alter how people use technology and expand the
   range of services available beyond conventional systems that can be
   accessed online. As the efficiency, performance, and quality of service
   access reach their peak levels, the focus has shifted to the user
   experience. Due to this, there is an increasing demand for more involved
   and thorough customer service, and service providers are willing to
   increase their present standards. Consumers are genuinely asking for
   tactile and immersive elements in their digital interfaces, but these
   features can only be made possible by the metaverse's potentially
   futuristic subfields of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),
   mixed reality (MR), and extended reality (XR). However, the metaverse
   may not be widely used due to significant security and privacy issues
   either from underlying technology or produced by the new digital
   environment. A variety of fundamental problems, such as scalability and
   interoperability, can arise in terms of ensuring security for the
   metaverse because of the metaverse's inherent properties, such as
   immersive realism, sustainability, and heterogeneity. In this survey, we
   propose a hypothetical meta-stack framework to understand the various
   components in the realm of metaverse and then provide wide-ranging
   insights on the most recent development in metaverse realm in the
   context of cutting-edge technologies, security vulnerabilities and
   preventive measures specific to the metaverse and the research
   challenges pertaining to metaverse.},

Title = {Enhancing Operational Resilience of Critical Infrastructure Processes
   Through Chaos Engineering},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {106172-106189},
Abstract = {Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interdependent, mechanical and
   IT components that support operations in most of society's critical
   infrastructures. Time and again history has proven that CPS are
   vulnerable to numerous types of threats, ranging from safety accidents
   to cybersecurity malicious attacks. Current research focuses on
   analyzing the various input vectors in CPS, whether mechanical or IT, to
   detect and patch flaws and vulnerabilities to mitigate potential impact
   in operation. Still, there is little work that can inherently analyze
   the software-based implementation of modern CPS with complex behavior
   and failure modes. The only vaguely relevant approach involves an
   operations-based experimentation methodology from NetFlix named chaos
   engineering (CE) that tests use cases on complex Content Delivery
   Networks (CDN) to build confidence in their capability to withstand
   turbulent conditions in production. Conditions can range from hardware
   failures to DoS attacks, to a malformed injection appearing in a runtime
   configuration parameter. Yet this approach was only tested on software
   based CDN, and not on CPS with industrial actuators and mechanical parts
   that control physical processes. In this paper, we introduce a novel
   framework that combines CE with digital twin (DT) technology to enhance
   the detection of operational vulnerabilities and increase the resilience
   of CPS. To achieve this objective, we integrated CE experimentation into
   the simulation phase of DT models using material flow networks. This
   allows us to assess system resilience during the operational stage
   without disrupting critical operations and identify vulnerable flows and
   processes within the modeled system. To evaluate the effectiveness of
   our approach, we conduct experiments on a DT that models a real-world
   Liquefied Petroleum Gas purification process from an existing oil
   refinery in the Mediterranean area. The results of these experiments
   demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing the heightened
   susceptibility of the Gas purification process to adverse events.},

Title = {VITROBENCH: Manipulating in-vehicle networks and COTS ECUs on your bench
   A comprehensive test platform for automotive cybersecurity research},
Journal = {VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the increasing connectivity employed in automotive systems, remote
   cyber attacks have now become a possibility and concrete threat. Prior
   works on automotive cyber security solutions have primarily focused
   evaluation either on real cars or via emulations of electronic control
   units (ECUs). Evaluation on real cars offers limited flexibility in
   manoeuvring the packets communicated through in-vehicle network (IVN).
   Meanwhile, emulations of ECUs rely on assumptions that may not
   correspond to the exact features in an IVN. In this paper, we present
   VITROBENCH, a comprehensive test platform involving commercial
   off-the-shelf (COTS) ECUs that allows arbitrary packet control over IVN.
   In contrast to existing automotive testbed, an appealing feature of
   VITROBENCH is that it allows replication of driving use cases and
   scenarios directly on the testbed involving COTS ECUs. This, in turn,
   allows us to design and evaluate concrete attacks that are directly
   related to a driving scenario. We present the design of VITROBENCH that
   allows us to sniff, inject packets to and isolate targeted ECU via
   bridging. The isolation of ECUs also offers fuzzing the respective ECUs.
   We evaluate the capability of VITROBENCH via launching concrete attacks
   and demonstrating the impact of such attacks. We discuss the careful
   design choices involved in VITROBENCH that inspire automotive
   cybersecurity research in future. \& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {The growing role of integrated and insightful big and real-time data
   analytics platforms},
Booktitle = {DIGITAL TWIN PARADIGM FOR SMARTER SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS: THE INDUSTRY
   USE CASES},
Series = {Advances in Computers},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {165-186},
Abstract = {Digitization era is altering several industries which include the way in
   which the data is analyzed and it is inferred that about 2.7 Zettabytes
   of data exist in the digital world today. By 2020 the data generated per
   second for every human being will approximate amount to 1.7 megabytes
   and the volume of data would double every 2 years thus reach the 40 ZB
   point by 2020. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by the
   end of year 2020, the e-commerce transactions B2B and B2C will hit 450
   billion per day on the internet.
   The advent of Big and real time Data has triggered disruptive changes in
   many fields and the exploding volume of different sources of data like
   heterogeneous data, data integration, spatio-temporal correlation of
   data, batch analytics and real-time analytics, data sharing, semantic
   interoperability requires the development of a scalable platform that
   can fuse multiple data layers to handles the data intelligently.
   In Big Data approaches, the challenge is not anymore to collect the
   data, but to draw valuable conclusions by properly analyzing them. The
   growth in Unstructured Data generated by business is irrefutable and
   they are under more pressure to preserve it for longer periods of time.
   To be clear, exploiting the collected data has been always considered by
   practitioners and researchers, but the huge velocity, heterogeneity and
   enormity of massive stream of real-time data shove the limits of the
   current storage, management and processing capabilities.
   Admittedly, the traditional method of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)
   are challenged and cannot be applied on the emerging opportunistically
   and crowed sensed data streams. Some of these data streams are
   structured in a way that serve only one predefined purpose and cannot be
   directly used for other means. Yet, there are emerging unstructured data
   such as context-based data from the internet and social media as well as
   credit card transactions that is not clear if they can be used to better
   understand the mobility patterns.
   The analytical company Gartner states that by 2020 there will be over 26
   billion interconnected devices. It is obvious, that they will produce
   massive amounts of meaningful data. Those data can be used for many
   applications such as real-time industrial equipment monitoring, traffic
   planning, automated maintenance, etc. Therefore, it is essential to
   develop modern system abstractions that allow us to resourcefully
   process huge and new data streams. This enormous amount of data urges
   the growth of integrated and insightful big and real-time data analytics
   Platforms.
   The upcoming contemporary technology like digital twin, integrates
   historical data from past machine usage to the current data. It uses
   sensors to collect the real-time data, working status and other
   operational data attached to the physical model. These components send
   the relevant data via a cloud-based system to the other side of the
   bridge with the help of data analytics platform which produces the
   required insights. The big and real-time data analytics Platforms assist
   to perform useful operations on data analytics as a complete package.
   For this purpose, data analytics platform are used to acquire
   constructive insight from the huge volume of data.
   Data analytics platform is an ecosystem of technologies and services
   that can help the businesses in increasing revenues, enhance operational
   efficiency, stabilize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts,
   respondmore quickly toemerging market trends and gain a competitive edge
   over rivals. The data analytics platform finds the pattern and
   relationships in data by applying statistical techniques and
   communicates the results generated by analytical models to executives
   and end users to make decisions with the help of data visualization
   tools that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real
   time as new information becomes available. Big data and real-time data
   analytics platform supports the full spectrum of data types, protocols
   and integration to speed up and simplify the data wrangling process. The
   big data and real time platform provides accurate data, increase
   efficiency in the workspace, gives answers to complex questions along
   with security and hence it plays the key role in business analytics.},

Pages = {391-430},
Abstract = {In recent years, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) came into
   being. IIoT connects sensors, industrial equipment, products, and staff
   in the factory, enabling context-awareness and industrial equipment
   automate control. The identity resolution system is a core
   infrastructure in IIoT. Similar to the role of Domain Name System (DNS)
   on the Internet, it is the entrance to the IIoT. The difference between
   them is their input and output. The input of the identity resolution
   system in IIoT is an identifier of an object. And the output is the
   mapping data attached to the identifier, including the product profile,
   a URL, or the identifier's surrounding environment. However, how to
   deploy an identity resolution system in IIoT has not yet been
   conclusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the
   potential identity resolution systems that may be used in IIoT. Firstly,
   an overview of the identity resolution system is introduced, including a
   reference framework that can be used to evaluate an identity resolution
   system. Then we review some influential identity resolution systems
   based on this reference framework. After that, we make a comparison from
   the perspective of whether they can meet IIoT requirements and
   technology selection. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives
   are discussed.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Blockchain is a novel technology with a wide range of potential
   industrial applications. Despite a vast range of tests, prototypes, and
   proof of concepts implemented in the last years, the industrial use of
   Blockchain technology is still in the early stages. Enabling the
   interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with
   Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in
   both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with
   distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity
   that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular:
   interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be
   guaranteed by design.
   This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic
   and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless
   applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an
   industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern
   and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors.
   Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering
   paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been
   designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios.
   Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between
   industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of
   immutable and trust-less ``digital twins{''} for industrial IOT
   applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Palmprint recognition based on gating mechanism and adaptive feature
   fusion},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {As a type of biometric recognition, palmprint recognition uses unique
   discriminative features on the palm of a person to identify his/her
   identity. It has attracted much attention because of its advantages of
   contactlessness, stability, and security. Recently, many palmprint
   recognition methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have
   been proposed in academia. Convolutional neural networks are limited by
   the size of the convolutional kernel and lack the ability to extract
   global information of palmprints. This paper proposes a framework based
   on the integration of CNN and Transformer-GLGAnet for palmprint
   recognition, which can take advantage of CNN's local information
   extraction and Transformer's global modeling capabilities. A gating
   mechanism and an adaptive feature fusion module are also designed for
   palmprint feature extraction. The gating mechanism filters features by a
   feature selection algorithm and the adaptive feature fusion module fuses
   them with the features extracted by the backbone network. Through
   extensive experiments on two datasets, the experimental results show
   that the recognition accuracy is 98.5\% for 12,000 palmprints in the
   Tongji University dataset and 99.5\% for 600 palmprints in the Hong Kong
   Polytechnic University dataset. This demonstrates that the proposed
   method outperforms existing methods in the correctness of both palmprint
   recognition tasks. The source codes will be available on .},

Title = {Deep Learning in the Ubiquitous Human-Computer Interactive 6G Era:
   Applications, Principles and Prospects},
Journal = {BIOMIMETICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of enabling technologies like VR and AR, we
   human beings are on the threshold of the ubiquitous human-centric
   intelligence era. 6G is believed to be an indispensable cornerstone for
   efficient interaction between humans and computers in this promising
   vision. 6G is supposed to boost many human-centric applications due to
   its unprecedented performance improvements compared to 5G and before.
   However, challenges are still to be addressed, including but not limited
   to the following six aspects: Terahertz and millimeter-wave
   communication, low latency and high reliability, energy efficiency,
   security, efficient edge computing and heterogeneity of services. It is
   a daunting job to fit traditional analytical methods into these problems
   due to the complex architecture and highly dynamic features of
   ubiquitous interactive 6G systems. Fortunately, deep learning can
   circumvent the interpretability issue and train tremendous neural
   network parameters, which build mapping relationships from neural
   network input (status and specific requirements of a 6G application) to
   neural network output (settings to satisfy the requirements). Deep
   learning methods can be an efficient alternative to traditional
   analytical methods or even conquer unresolvable predicaments of
   analytical methods. We review representative deep learning solutions to
   the aforementioned six aspects separately and focus on the principles of
   fitting a deep learning method into specific 6G issues. Based on this
   review, our main contributions are highlighted as follows. (i) We
   investigate the representative works in a systematic view and find out
   some important issues like the vital role of deep reinforcement learning
   in the 6G context. (ii) We point out solutions to the lack of training
   data in 6G communication context. (iii) We reveal the relationship
   between traditional analytical methods and deep learning, in terms of 6G
   applications. (iv) We identify some frequently used efficient techniques
   in deep-learning-based 6G solutions. Finally, we point out open problems
   and future directions.},

Title = {Reinforcement learning-based virtual network embedding: A comprehensive
   survey},
Journal = {ICT EXPRESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {983-994},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Virtual network embedding plays a vital role in network virtualization,
   as it determines the deployment and connection of virtual networks to
   the physical network in the 5G and beyond. An efficient virtual network
   embedding algorithm is essential to ensure that virtual networks are
   embedded in a way that meets the performance, security, and resource
   requirements of the virtual networks and their users. The integration of
   reinforcement learning with virtual network embedding can lead to more
   intelligent and efficient network management, which can enhance the
   performance of large-scale networked systems. Reinforcement learning has
   the potential to improve and overcome some limitations of traditional
   algorithms, such as the need for prior knowledge of network conditions
   and the difficulty in dealing with non-linear and dynamic network
   environments. Therefore, we conducted this survey to provide a
   comprehensive overview and examine potential future directions for the
   optimal reinforcement learning-based virtual network embedding
   solutions. However, applying reinforcement learning directly to virtual
   network embedding is a challenging task that requires further research
   and study. Additionally, it encourages researchers to examine the
   potential of reinforcement learning in virtual network embedding,
   identify the challenges for its application, and cover various factors
   related to the reinforcement learning application in virtual network
   embedding, including motivations, performance metrics, and
   challenges.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Title = {SHAP Interpretations of Tree and Neural Network DNS Classifiers for
   Analyzing DGA Family Characteristics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {61144-61160},
Abstract = {Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA's) have been employed by botnet
   orchestrators for controlling infected hosts (bots), while evading
   detection by performing multiple DNS requests, mostly for non-existing
   domain names. With blacklists ineffective, modern DGA filtering methods
   rely on Machine Learning (ML). Emerging needs for higher intrusion
   detection accuracy lead to complex, non-interpretable black-box
   classifiers, thus requiring eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
   techniques. In this paper, we utilize SHapley Additive exPlanation
   (SHAP) to derive model-agnostic, post-hoc interpretations on DGA name
   classifiers. This method is applied to binary supervised tree-based
   classifiers (e.g. eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost) and deep neural
   networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to assess domain name feature
   importance. SHAP visualization tools (summary, dependence, force plots)
   are used to rank features, investigate their effect on model decisions
   and determine their interactions. Specific interpretations are detailed
   for identifying names belonging to common DGA families pertaining to
   arithmetic, wordlist, hash and permutation based schemes. Learning and
   interpretations are based on up-to-date datasets, such as Tranco for
   benign and DGArchive for malicious names. Domain name features are
   extracted from dataset instances, thus limiting time-consuming and
   privacy-invasive database operations on historical data. Our
   experimental results demonstrate that SHAP enables explanations of
   XGBoost (the most accurate tree-based model) and MLP classifiers and
   indicates the characteristics of specific DGA schemes, commonly employed
   in attacks. In conclusion, we envision that XAI methods will expedite ML
   deployment in networking environments where justifications for black-box
   models are required.},

Title = {A Data Normalization Technique for Detecting Cyber Attacks on UAVs},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The data analysis subsystem of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) includes
   two main modules: a data acquisition module for data processing and a
   normalization module. One of the main features of an adaptive UAV
   protection system is the analysis of its cyber-physical parameters. An
   attack on a general-purpose computer system mainly affects the
   integrity, confidentiality and availability of important information. By
   contrast, an attack on a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), such as a UAV,
   affects the functionality of the system and may disrupt its operation,
   ultimately preventing it from fulfilling its tasks correctly.
   Cyber-physical parameters are the internal parameters of a system node,
   including the states of its computing resources, data storage, actuators
   and sensor system. Here, we develop a data normalization technique that
   additionally allows us to identify the signs of a cyber-attack. In
   addition, we define sets of parameters that can highlight an attack and
   define a new database format to support intrusion detection for UAVs. To
   achieve these goals, we performed an experimental study of the impact of
   attacks on UAV parameters and developed a software module for collecting
   data from UAVs, as well as a technique for normalizing and presenting
   data for detecting attacks on UAVs. Data analysis and the evaluation of
   the quality of a parameter (whether the parameter changes normally, or
   abrupt anomalous changes are observed) are facilitated by converting
   different types of data to the same format. The resulting formalized CPS
   model allows us to identify the nature of an attack and its potential
   impact on UAV subsystems. In the future, such a model could be the basis
   of a CPS digital twin in terms of security. The presented normalization
   technique supports processing raw data, as well as classifying data sets
   for their use in machine learning (ML) analyses in the future. The data
   normalization technique can also help to immediately determine the
   presence and signs of an attack, which allows classifying raw data
   automatically by dividing it into different categories. Such a technique
   could form the basis of an intrusion detection system for CPSs. Thus,
   the obtained results can be used to classify attacks, including attack
   detection systems based on machine learning methods, and the data
   normalization technique can be used as an independent method for
   detecting attacks.},

Volume = {7},
Pages = {17578-17598},
Abstract = {In the last century, the automotive industry has arguably transformed
   society, being one of the most complex, sophisticated, and
   technologically advanced industries, with innovations ranging from the
   hybrid, electric, and self-driving smart cars to the development of
   IoT-connected cars. Due to its complexity, it requires the involvement
   of many Industry 4.0 technologies, like robotics, advanced manufacturing
   systems, cyber-physical systems, or augmented reality. One of the latest
   technologies that can benefit the automotive industry is blockchain,
   which can enhance its data security, privacy, anonymity, traceability,
   accountability, integrity, robustness, transparency, trustworthiness,
   and authentication, as well as provide long-term sustainability and a
   higher operational efficiency to the whole industry. This review
   analyzes the great potential of applying blockchain technologies to the
   automotive industry emphasizing its cybersecurity features. Thus, the
   applicability of blockchain is evaluated after examining the
   state-of-the-art and devising the main stakeholders' current challenges.
   Furthermore, the article describes the most relevant use cases, since
   the broad adoption of blockchain unlocks a wide area of short- and
   medium-term promising automotive applications that can create new
   business models and even disrupt the car-sharing economy as we know it.
   Finally, after strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
   analysis, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding
   researchers and companies in future cyber-resilient automotive industry
   developments.},

Abstract = {The physical world is transformed into being digitized and makes
   everything connected. An explosion of smart devices and technologies has
   allowed mankind to be in constant communication anywhere and anytime.
   IoT trend has created a sub-segment of the IoT market known as the
   industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) or Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0
   dubbed I4.0 marks the fourth in the Industrial Revolution that focuses
   heavily on interconnectivity, automation, autonomy, machine learning,
   and real-time data. By 2020, it is estimated that over 30 billion of the
   world's devices will be connected in some waywhich is 20 billion more
   devices than today! The consistent capturing and transmitting of data
   among machines provide manufacturing companies with many growth
   opportunities. The IIoT is expected to transform how we live, work and
   play. The number one challenge faced by the Industrial IoT is security
   and privacy. If we cannot alleviate many of the security and privacy

Abstract = {With the concepts of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing gaining
   popularity, there is a growing notion that conventional manufacturing
   will witness a transition toward a new paradigm, targeting innovation,
   automation, better response to customer needs, and intelligent systems.
   Within this context, this review focuses on the concept of
   cyber-physical production system (CPPS) and presents a holistic
   perspective on the role of the CPPS in three key and essential drivers
   of this transformation: data-driven manufacturing, decentralized
   manufacturing, and integrated blockchains for data security. The paper
   aims to connect these three aspects of smart manufacturing and proposes
   that through the application of data-driven modeling, CPPS will aid in
   transforming manufacturing to become more intuitive and automated. In
   turn, automated manufacturing will pave the way for the decentralization
   of manufacturing. Layering blockchain technologies on top of CPPS will
   ensure the reliability and security of data sharing and integration
   across decentralized systems. Each of these claims is supported by
   relevant case studies recently published in the literature and from the
   industry; a brief on existing challenges and the way forward is also
   provided. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of

Title = {Advancing zero defect manufacturing: A state-of-the-art perspective and
   future research directions},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Zero Defect Manufacturing is a disruptive concept that has the potential
   to entirely reshape the manufacturing ideology. Building on the same
   quality management philosophy that underpins both lean production and
   Six Sigma, the Zero Defect Manufacturing paradigm has in recent years
   developed significantly, given the onset of Industry 4.0 and the
   increasing maturity of its digital technologies. In this paper, we
   review contemporary advances in Zero Defect Manufacturing using
   structured literature review. We explore emergent themes and present
   important directions for future development in this continuously
   emerging field of research and practice. We highlight two specific Zero
   Defect Manufacturing strategy types: defect prevention, and defect
   compensation; as well as identify two important themes for future ZDM
   research, namely advancing ZDM research (particularly with a view to
   progressing from zero-defect processes to zero-waste value chain
   strategies) and overcoming the global application challenges of ZDM
   (with emphasis on cyber-security and the extension of defect prevention
   and compensation strategies to less explored manufacturing processes).

Title = {Digital Twins for Managing Health Care Systems: Rapid Literature Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background: Although most digital twin (DT) applications for health care
   have emerged in precision medicine, DTs can potentially support the
   overall health care process. DTs (twinned systems, processes, and
   products) can be used to optimize flows, improve performance, improve
   health outcomes, and improve the experiences of patients, doctors, and
   other stakeholders with minimal risk.
   Objective: This paper aims to review applications of DT systems,
   products, and processes as well as analyze the potential of these
   applications for improving health care management and the challenges
   associated with this emerging technology.
   Methods: We performed a rapid review of the literature and reported
   available studies on DTs and their applications in health care
   management. We searched 5 databases for studies published between
   January 2002 and January 2022 and included peer-reviewed studies written
   in English. We excluded studies reporting DT usage to support health
   care practice (organ transplant, precision medicine, etc). Studies were
   analyzed based on their contribution toward DT technology to improve
   user experience in health care from human factors and systems
   engineering perspectives, accounting for the type of impact (product,
   process, or performance/system level). Challenges related to the
   adoption of DTs were also summarized.
   Results: The DT-related studies aimed at managing health care systems
   have been growing over time from 0 studies in 2002 to 17 in 2022, with 7
   published in 2021 (N=17 studies). The findings reported on applications
   categorized by DT type (system: n=8; process: n=5; product: n=4) and
   their contributions or functions. We identified 4 main functions of DTs
   in health care management including safety management (n=3), information
   management (n=2), health management and well-being promotion (n=3), and
   operational control (n=9). DTs used in health care systems management
   have the potential to avoid unintended or unexpected harm to people
   during the provision of health care processes. They also can help
   identify crisis-related threats to a system and control the impacts. In
   addition, DTs ensure privacy, security, and real-time information access
   to all stakeholders. Furthermore, they are beneficial in empowering
   self-care abilities by enabling health management practices and
   providing high system efficiency levels by ensuring that health care
   facilities run smoothly and offer high-quality care to every patient.
   Conclusions: The use of DTs for health care systems management is an
   emerging topic. This can be seen in the limited literature supporting
   this technology. However, DTs are increasingly being used to ensure
   patient safety and well-being in an organized system. Thus, further
   studies aiming to address the challenges of health care systems
   challenges and improve their performance should investigate the
   potential of DT technology. In addition, such technologies should embed
   human factors and ergonomics principles to ensure better design and more
   successful impact on patient and doctor experiences.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is a rapidly developing field
   with several prospective clinical studies demonstrating its benefits in
   clinical practice. In 2022, the Korean Society of Radiology held a forum
   to discuss the challenges and drawbacks in AI development and

   widespread adoption of AI in radiology, such as limited annotated data,
   data privacy and security, data heterogeneity, imbalanced data, model
   interpretability, overfitting, and integration with clinical workflows.
   In this review, some of the various possible solutions to these
   challenges are presented and discussed; these include training with
   longitudinal and multimodal datasets, dense training with multitask
   learning and multimodal learning, self-supervised contrastive learning,
   various image modifications and syntheses using generative models,
   explainable AI, causal learning, federated learning with large data

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Radio access network (RAN) technologies continue to evolve, with Open
   RAN gaining the most recent momentum. In the O-RAN specifications, the
   RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) are software-defined orchestration
   and automation functions for the intelligent management of RAN. This
   article introduces principles for machine learning (ML), in particular,
   reinforcement learning (RL) applications in the O-RAN stack.
   Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art research in wireless
   networks and cast it onto the RAN framework and the hierarchy of the
   O-RAN architecture. We provide a taxonomy for the challenges faced by
   ML/RL models throughout the development life-cycle: from the system
   specification to production deployment (data acquisition, model design,
   testing and management, etc.). To address the challenges, we integrate a
   set of existing MLOps principles with unique characteristics when RL
   agents are considered. This paper discusses a systematic model
   development, testing and validation life-cycle, termed: RLOps. We
   discuss fundamental parts of RLOps, which include: model specification,
   development, production environment serving, operations monitoring and
   safety/security. Based on these principles, we propose the best
   practices for RLOps to achieve an automated and reproducible model
   development process. At last, a holistic data analytics platform rooted
   in the O-RAN deployment is designed and implemented, aiming to embrace
   and fulfil the aforementioned principles and best practices of RLOps.},

Title = {Blockchain-Enabled IoT-BIM Platform for Supply Chain Management in
   Modular Construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Configuring a trustworthy Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled building
   information modeling (BIM) platform (IBP) is significant for modular
   construction to ensure transparency, traceability, and immutability
   throughout its fragmented supply chain management. However, most current
   IBPs are designed adopting a centralized system architecture, which
   fails to achieve a decentralized and effective one to ensure a single
   point of truth in BIM and prevent a single point of failure in IoT
   networks. To address this challenge, this study introduces permissioned
   blockchain with IBP and proposes a novel service-oriented system
   architecture of blockchain-enabled IoT-BIM platform (BIBP) for the
   data-information-knowledge (DIK)-driven supply chain management in
   modular construction. First, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is
   designed with hardware, core technologies, and protocols to offer
   accurate data from daily practice to blockchain BIM. Blockchain BIM as a
   service (BaaS) is then developed within the permissioned blockchain to
   ease the interoperability of the information, semantics, and meaningful
   inferences. Furthermore, software as a service (SaaS) is configured with
   decentralized applications to achieve knowledgeable operations or
   processes with a crash fault-tolerant consensus mechanism. The
   demonstrative case study in a modular student residence project
   evaluates the proposed BIBP system prototype with the performance
   analysis of storage cost, throughput, latency, privacy, and feedback
   from stakeholders. The results indicate that BIBP has an effective
   system architecture with acceptable throughput and latency, can save
   storage costs to achieve a single point of truth in BIM, and avoid a
   single point of failure for IoT networks with privacy and
   security-preserving mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The traffic environment and driving behaviors are of great complexity
   and uncertainty in our physical world. Therefore, training in the
   digital world with low cost and diverse complexities become popular for
   autonomous driving in recent years. However, the current training
   methods tend to be limited to static data sets and deterministic models
   that do not sufficiently take into account the uncertainty and diversity
   prevalent in real traffic scenarios. These approaches also limit more
   possibilities for the comprehensive development and optimization of
   vision systems. In this paper, we develop a parallel training method
   based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel
   execution (ACP) for the intelligent optimization and learning of the
   aforementioned agents in uncertain driving spaces. Parallel training
   creates a virtual driving space following the instruction of the ACP
   approach and conducts large-scale rehearsal experiments for possible
   scenarios. By enhancing the diversity of virtual scenarios, intelligent
   vehicles are trained to respond and adapt to the diverse uncertainties
   in the physical real-world driving space. Specifically, parallel
   training first proposes a standard operating procedure for intelligent
   driving systems, namely the projection-emergence-convergence-operation
   (PECO) loop. Digital quadruplets for parallel training, i.e., physical,
   descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive coaches, are also proposed.
   With the guidance of parallel training, virtual and real-world driving
   spaces are set up in parallel and interact frequently. They are closely
   linked and unified in opposition to each other, ultimately building a
   parallel driving system that fulfills safety, security, sustainability,
   sensitivity, service, and smartness (6S).},

Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Infrastructure plays a pivotal role in a nation's economic stability,
   security, and long-term sustainability. For decades, United States
   infrastructure has been rated as inadequate and the resources required
   for its restoration continue to grow. Despite the transformative
   potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) coupled with digital
   technologies in revolutionizing the building industry, its widespread
   adoption within infrastructure projects remains limited. This study
   explores the application of BIM and emerging technologies in
   transportation projects' lifecycle, identifies research gaps, and
   discusses the use of technology to address current infrastructure
   challenges. Employing a systematic review approach, this research
   synthesizes BIM application studies based on well-defined criteria. The
   synthesis of the literature underscores the comprehensive integration of
   BIM throughout the lifecycle of transportation assets, catalyzed by
   collaborative, information-driven processes. However, challenges
   pertaining to interoperability, role delineation, standards enforcement,
   and cost persist. This study advocates for a deeper exploration of the
   synergy between BIM, digital technologies, and infrastructure,
   envisioning an enriched transportation lifecycle in the future.},

Title = {Blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart modular integrated construction},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Modular Integrated Construction (MiC) has been one of the most
   innovative solutions to address the ever-growing housing demands in
   megacities such as Hong Kong. MiC offers a range of benefits including
   cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for
   construction industry. Multiple stakeholders in MiC project, such as
   project client, module manufacturer, logistics company, and building
   contractor, normally use their own proprietary and centralized
   Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, stake-holders are facing
   challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. ``Islands of
   Information{''} issue is commonly existing and creates information
   fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards
   and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P
   framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the
   information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper
   proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to
   facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple
   sta-keholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical
   roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and
   application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines.
   Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are
   analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is
   designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity
   digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that
   MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress
   traceability, and real-time KPI visualization \& evaluation, but also
   improves the in-formation reliability, immutability, and transparency in
   MiC projects. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {9},
Pages = {113270-113291},
Abstract = {Working at an oil and gas facility, such as a drilling rig, production
   facility, processing facility, or storage facility, involves various
   challenges, including health and safety risks. It is possible to
   leverage emerging digital technologies such as smart sensors, wearable
   or mobile devices, big data analytics, cloud computing, extended reality
   technologies, robotic systems, and drones to mitigate the challenges
   faced by oil and gas workers. While these technologies are not new to
   the oil and gas industry, most of its existing digital transformation
   initiatives follow business or process-centric approaches, in which the
   critical driver of the technology adoption is the enhancement of
   production, efficiency, and revenue. As a result, they may not address
   the challenges faced by the workers. As oil and gas workers are among
   the essential assets in the oil and gas industry, it is vital to address
   the challenges faced by these workers. This paper proposes a
   human-centric digital transformational framework for the oil and gas
   industry to deploy existing digital technologies to enhance their
   workers' health, safety, and working conditions. The paper outlines the
   critical challenges faced by oilfield workers, introduces a system
   architecture to implements a human-centric digital transformation,
   discusses the opportunities of the proposed framework, and summarizes
   the key impediment for the proposed framework.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Decision-making for manufacturing and maintenance operations is
   benefiting from the advanced sensor infrastructure of Industry 4.0,
   enabling the use of algorithms that analyze data, predict emerging
   situations, and recommend mitigating actions. The current paper reviews
   the literature on data-driven decision-making in maintenance and
   outlines directions for future research towards data-driven
   decision-making for Industry 4.0 maintenance applications. The main
   research directions include the coupling of decision-making with
   augmented reality for seamless interfacing that combines the real and
   virtual worlds of manufacturing operators; methods and techniques for
   addressing uncertainty of data, in lieu of emerging Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices; integration of maintenance decision-making with other
   operations such as scheduling and planning; utilization of the cloud

Abstract = {Automated object measurement is becoming increasingly important due to
   its ability to reduce manual costs, increase production efficiency, and
   minimize errors in various fields. In this paper, we present a novel
   approach to three-dimensional (3D) object measurement based on point
   cloud modeling. Our method introduces a fast point cloud modeling
   computation framework consisting of five stages: coordinate
   centralization, rotation and translation, noise filtering, plane
   projection, and geometric computation. Furthermore, we propose a fast
   convex hull optimization algorithm to reduce the high complexity problem
   of traditional convex hull calculation. Our extensive experiments
   demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of
   measurement error rate and time savings, with a maximum time saving of
   31.03\% under certain error conditions.},

Title = {Trustworthy Transaction Spreading Using Node Reliability Estimation in
   IoT Blockchain Networks},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Featured Application Blockchain-powered IoT Applications, such as
   agricultural applications, logistics, and smart factory data management.
   Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for
   constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT
   networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain
   network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart
   factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread
   of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks
   guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network
   maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However,
   IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic
   configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it
   impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network.
   A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical
   transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning
   framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper
   spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework
   determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN
   determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The
   discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of
   transactions to the destination node. In addition, the proposed
   trustworthy transaction spreading was implemented over an InterPlanetary
   File system (IPFS). The IPFS-powered experiments confirmed the
   practicability of the proposed transaction spreading mechanism.},

Abstract = {The virtual world created by the development of the Internet, computers,
   artificial intelligence (AI), and hardware technologies have brought
   various degrees of digital transformation to people's lives. With
   multiple demands for virtual reality increasing, the metaverse, a new
   type of social ecology that can connect the physical and virtual worlds,
   is booming. However, with the rapid growth of data volume and value, the
   continuous evolution of the metaverse faces the demands and challenges
   of privacy, security, high synchronization, and low latency.
   Fortunately, the ever-evolving blockchain and intelligent networking
   technologies can be used to satisfy the trusted construction, continuous
   data interaction, and computing demands of the metaverse. Therefore, it
   is necessary to conduct an in-depth review of the role and gains of
   blockchain, intelligent networking, and the combination of both in
   providing the immersive experiences of the metaverse. In this survey, we
   first discuss the development trend, characteristics, and architecture
   of the metaverse. Then, the existing work on blockchain, networking, and
   the combination of the two technologies are reviewed, including
   overviews, applications, and challenges. Next, applications of the
   metaverse are summarized, emphasizing the importance of the metaverse
   and the fields of development. Finally, we discuss some open issues,
   challenges, and future research directions.},

Title = {Biomass-based lateral root morphological parameter models for rapeseed
   (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.)},
Journal = {FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Lateral roots, including adventitious roots, are the main component of
   rapeseed roots with support, absorb, and synthesis functions and their
   morphological parameters directly affecting the plant's aboveground
   growth and yield. Root biomass, as a material base for lateral root
   growth, can be used as a link between plant phenotypes and their
   physiological processes, as well as to enhance root 3D growth model
   mechanisms and accuracy. To quantify the relationships between lateral
   root morphological indices and the corresponding organ biomass for
   rapeseed, we used two cultivars, NY 22 (conventional) and NZ 1818
   (hybrid), and conducted cultivar and fertilizing cylindrical tube
   experiments during the 2016-2019, with two fertilizer levels, no
   fertilizer, and 180 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer. The lateral root biomass and
   morphological parameters were determined during the whole growth period.
   The biomass-based lateral root morphological parameter models were
   developed by analyzing the quantitative relationship between the lateral
   root morphological indices and their corresponding biomass, and the
   descriptive models were verified with independent experimental data. The
   results showed that the correlation (r) of simulated and observed values
   for the lateral root morphological parameters are all greater than 0.9
   with significant levels at p < 0.001. The absolute values of the average
   absolute difference (d(a)) of simulated and observed values for the
   lateral root length (L-LR), lateral root average diameter (AD(LR)),
   lateral root surface area (SA(LR)), and lateral root volume (V-LR) are
   -30.408 cm, -0.003 mm, 12.902 cm(2), and 0.039 cm(3), respectively. The
   RMSE values are 175.183 cm, 0.010 mm, 59.710 cm(2), and 1.513 cm(3),
   respectively. The ratio of d(a) to the average observed values (d(ap))
   for the L-LR and V-LR are all less than 5\%, and the AD(LR) and SA(LR)
   are all <6\%. The models developed in this paper have good performance
   and reliability for predicting lateral root morphological parameters of
   rapeseed. The study provides a mechanistic method for linking the
   rapeseed growth model with the morphological model using corresponding
   organic biomass and laying a good foundation for establishing a 3D
   morphological model for rapeseed root system based on biomass.},

Title = {Vehicular Abandoned Object Detection Based on VANET and Edge AI in Road
   Scenes},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 28},
Abstract = {Rapid processing of abandoned objects is one of the most important tasks
   in road maintenance. Abandoned object detection heavily relies on
   traditional object detection approaches at a fixed location. However,
   detection accuracy and range are still far from satisfactory. This study
   proposes an abandoned object detection approach based on vehicular
   ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and edge artificial intelligence (AI) in road
   scenes. We propose a vehicular detection architecture for abandoned
   objects to achieve task-based AI technology for large-scale road
   maintenance in mobile computing circumstances. To improve detection
   accuracy and reduce repeated detection rates in mobile computing, we
   propose a detection algorithm that combines a deep learning network and
   a deduplication module for high-frequency detection. Finally, we propose
   a location estimation approach for abandoned objects based on the World
   Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system and an affine projection
   model to accurately compute the positions of abandoned objects.
   Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves an
   average accuracy of 99.57\% and 53.11\% on the two datasets,
   respectively. Additionally, our whole system achieves real-time
   detection and high-precision localization performance on real roads.},

   Study of Collision Avoidance},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {89318-89336},
Abstract = {The rapid development and implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the engineering and manufacturing
   field have embraced a virtual identity to ensure nearly real-time
   adjustment. Warehouses are challenged to reassess its order fulfillment
   operations while simultaneously being provided with the opportunity to
   develop its own cloud-based CPS with the aid of IoT devices. Robotic
   Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS) is a system controlling mobile robots,
   mobile storage rack, putaway and picking workstations, charging
   stations, and wireless communication infrastructure in the context of
   robotic-assisted warehouse. This paper addresses the value creation
   utilizing cloud-based CPS in RMFS. By providing an analysis of cloud
   services and IoT enhancement, theoretical concepts from the literatures
   are consolidated to solve the research que-stions on how RMFS offering
   better order fulfillment can gain benefits in terms of operational
   efficiency and system reliability. The paper also proposes a cloud-based
   CPS architecture, providing a comprehensive understanding on conflict
   avoidance strategy in the multi-layers multi-deeps warehouse layout.
   This research presents six conflict classifications in RMFS and provides
   a case study in the real-life context. Dock grid conflict is a new type
   of conflict appearing in multi-deeps RMFS. A scenario analysis with real
   customer orders is applied to present the collision detection and
   solution.},

Title = {Single-tag and multi-tag RFID data cleaning approach in edge computing},
Journal = {CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND
   APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 27},
Abstract = {As the performance of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices is
   susceptible to the influence of the surrounding environment, making the
   original data collected by RFID devices with uncertain, of which missed
   data and redundant data are the main source of uncertainty data, these
   uncertainty data will seriously affect the quality of RFID upper layer
   applications. Therefore, to solve the uncertainty in RFID data, the
   original data must be cleaned. For the shortcomings of tag dynamics
   detection in the traditional data cleaning algorithm named Statistical
   Smoothing for Unreliable RFID data (SMURF), an adaptive sliding
   window-based data cleaning algorithm for RFID single-tag is proposed.
   The method takes into account the influence of tag speed on tag
   integrity judgment, and divides sliding sub-windows to accurately detect
   tag changes and then reasonably adjusts the sliding window size. In
   addition, considering that the average reading rate of tags is affected
   by the collision between multiple tags, an RFID multi-tag cleaning
   method based on twice-tag number estimation is proposed. The method
   accurately estimates the number of tags by the twice-tag estimation
   method, controls the read period by the Markov chain, and reduces the
   occurrence of multiple tag collisions by using an unequal time slot
   optimization method. Experimental results show that the proposed method
   in this paper can form a complete set of RFID data stream cleaning
   algorithms, which effectively reduces the uncertain data and improves
   the data accuracy.},

Abstract = {Research in industry 4.0 is growing, driven by the innovations in
   production systems on a continuous basis. In this study, we identified
   the evolution of themes inherent in the industry 4.0 using a
   bibliometric software, namely SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software
   Tool). The analyses included 1882 documents, 4231 keywords, and the
   relevant information was extracted based on frequency of co-occurrence
   of keywords. The clusters were plotted in two-dimensional strategic
   diagrams and analysed using the bibliometric indicators such as the
   number of publications, number of associated documents, and h-index. The
   results revealed that 2017 had the largest number of publications.
   Expert authors in the field and the periodicals that published the most
   were identified. The science mapping presented 31 clusters in which the
   most representative motor themes were CPS (Cyber-Physical System), IoT
   (Internet of Things), and Big Data. In addition, it was possible to
   identify fields with high investment of efforts by the scientific
   community such as the union between lean production and industry 4.0,
   production-centered CPS (CPPS), IoT (Industrial Internet of Things -
   IIoT), among others. The overlapping map showed an increase in the
   number of keywords from 338 to 1231 over the period of data. The map of
   scientific developments supported by an exhaustive research, it was
   possible to show the state of the art, the main challenges and
   perspectives for future research in the field of industry 4.0 such as
   Technology, Collaboration/Integration, Management and Implementation.},
