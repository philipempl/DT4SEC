  abstract={Edge computing and digital twin technology are two new digital technologies that are developing rapidly. Edge computing has become more and more widely used in various scenarios and smart terminal devices, adding more and more edge computing business sinking demands, making the distance between computing and users and data smaller and smaller, and digital twin technology provides a method of model interpretation for complex physical entities, provides new ideas for physical information fusion, and makes it applicable to various scenarios of physical entities and the virtualization model can achieve deep coupling. Nowadays, society’s demand for power grids is getting higher and higher. Therefore, the security protection of power grids is an important issue worthy of in-depth consideration. After the introduction of edge computing and digital twins and technologies, the relative vulnerability of power grids has been further characterized. By analyzing the security risks and characteristics of edge computing, and based on the edge computing security protection architecture, a power grid digital twin security control model including the application layer, function layer, model layer, data layer, and physical layer is constructed, so as to ensure that all aspects of the power grid are controlled. Layers of protection of structures and units ensure that the power grid can still ensure efficient and safe operation in an environment blessed by new technologies.},

The digital twin has become an important method of the digital manufacturing processes for the fourth industrial revolution. The digital twin is driven by increased intelligence, digitization, and reliability of smart manufacturing assets. It has potential usage areas such as construction, smart cities, and healthcare. It could be used to increase the overall performance of the potential systems and to support the physical world. Although extensive benefits are recognized, the security risks for using the digital twin have yet to be explored. The physical world of various nodes communicates with the digital twin.

  abstract={A digital twin is a real-time representation of physical assets in a digital world. In future 6G networks, digital twin as the key technology will be widely used in intelligent manufacturing, smart city and scientific research etc., forwarding the whole society towards a "digital twin" world combining virtualization and reality. Just like the real network, the Digital Twin Network (DTN) will also face security risks and various attacks. In the DTN, the wrong instruction distribution from the twin network to physical network will directly affect the real world and cause chaos, so it is necessary to ensure the security of interaction interface. In this paper, we propose a security interaction engine named Digital Twin Protection Function (DTPF) to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, stability and non-reputation of messages during DTN policy distribution, which can provide a reference for securing the development of DTN.},

  abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that monitor individuals' physical and medical conditions are called Body Area Networks (BANs). This technology uses wireless sensors to monitor vital signs from the human body. In order to overcome processing and storage limitations, the BAN is often connected to the cloud. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), however, opens up the possibility of various security threats when using the cloud. The digital twin (DT) can provide users with hundreds of thousands of interpretations of the physical device without interfering with its normal functionality. It provides an accurate depiction of a cyberattack before time, which maximizes efficiency by reflecting and simulating the physical devices and their relationships with the environment. This paper proposes an integrated security framework for cloud-assisted BANs (CBANs), which will use DT to detect cyberattacks. By combining digital and physical models, cyber-physical security (CPS) can be optimized in advance at low risk and cost. The results of the study show that designing and evaluating techniques for the protection of CBAN using digital twin will help security experts to use an optimized solution without physical testing that will also save time and resources.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that is a cornerstone of the 4th industrial revolution. Over the next decade, it is expected to revolutionise industrial processes via Internet of Things (IoT) and other enabling technologies such as 5G for better performance and safety. DT as a real time virtual representation of any physical system is envisaged to ensure better connectivity of industrial processes, increased speed of decision making and effective prediction that could lead to optimised performance enhancement at various levels in the business chain. However, unsecured, or poorly secured DTs can cause serious harm to an enterprise in key industrial sectors such as manufacturing and oil and gas which are of utmost importance to the world’s economy. The focus of this paper, therefore, is to identify security vulnerabilities of DTs in applied to the oil and gas industry and analyse effective security frameworks for monitoring oil and gas pipeline data and its transmission over various networks including through the Cloud. This is to prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks and reduce economic losses that can result. Furthermore, important considerations on the data attributes will be explored. These include accuracy of the data transmitted under various security implementation regimes, its completeness, and transmission delay of the various frameworks.},

  abstract={The ANGEL Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical System Security is a novel approach for improving the security of critical and non-critical infrastructure. Digital Twin technology, widely used in the aviation, manufacturing and automotive industries, has the potential to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. In this paper, we present a framework for adapting the Digital Twin to the application of microgrid security. The Digital Twin is a real-time, physics-based simulation that runs alongside the physical system providing for its constant monitoring and control. The Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems, or ANGEL, will model both the cyber and physical layers of the microgrid and provide real-time data visualization. As a result, users will be aided in assessing the health of the physical plant and overall behavior over a range of operating conditions. The ANGEL Digital Twin will be able to use the real-time two-way coupling between the simulation and physical system to update and evolve the simulation to provide greater insight into the physical system. Ultimately ANGEL will provide the ability to diagnose and heal the physical system, mitigating both component failures and the effects of cyber attack. This paper will explain the methodology behind the design of this digital twin and the advantages of such an approach. To demonstrate the current capabilities of the ANGEL framework as a Level III digital twin, a simulation example is presented on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark.},

And, we formally define a problem whose objective is to maximize the participation of low source or reusable devices such that reusable surveillance borders are created within security district. Also, a dense sub-district with low resource devices priority completion scheme is proposed to resolve the problem.

However, these stages can be susceptible to various security attacks. This paper investigates the major security attacks that can occur throughout the stages of DT development and provides relevant countermeasures to counter these attacks. A use case of DT in the healthcare domain as an in-patient monitoring system is presented to provide a better understanding of the potential DT security attacks.

  abstract={In the digital twin environment, the fusion data onto physical entities in the physical space are mapped to multiple virtual spaces for digital modeling and intelligent simulation in different dimensions. In real intelligent manufacturing scenarios, heterogeneous multi-source fusion data are collected at the same time period. So they are consistent in time state. For the autonomous digital twin system, time states verification and integrity checking are basic security factors. Provable data possession technology can check the integrity of data onto virtual spaces. The blockchain can provide the synchronization interface to make distributed entities to obtain the trusted time state value. Considering the privacy, the blockchain can also provide anonymous services for entities. Therefore, we propose the blockchain-based synchronized provable data possession scheme (named BSPDP) for digital twin. In our scheme, the selection of verifier is flexible. Since virtual spaces may be maliciously framed to pay compensation, we use tag verification to prevent honest virtual spaces from being framed. Under the assumption of RSA, the proposed BSPDP is provably secure. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that BSPDP is practical. The experimental results show that BSPDP is effective and attractive for digital twin.},

In this work, we leverage the digital twin(DT) concept to help the information fusion and computing for AV, propose a vehicular digital twin(VDT) framework. Specifically, DT is maintained in the cloud and synchronized with its corresponding AV in real-time. AV uploads necessary information to the DT, and DT makes feedback through processing and analysis. The DT can also communicate with other DTs to obtain information. Due to the real-time information synchronization of AV and DT in an open communication environment, ensuring communication security and protect privacy is needed. To tackle those issues, we give a concrete authentication protocol for secure communication between AV and DT. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed protocol not only has less computation cost but also can satisfy the necessary security requirements.},

  abstract={Modern Residential Energy Storage Systems (RESSs) are monitored and controlled using Cloud based Energy Management System (CEMS). Analyzing the cyber-security of such RESSs controlled by CEMS is critical for developing appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems against cyber attacks targeting such RESSs. However, it is impractical and expensive to modify, scale and replicate the physical RESS as per the cyber-security study requirements. This paper presents, a lowcost Real-Time Digital Twin (RTDT) of an interconnected and distributed RESSs controlled and monitored via CEMS. Systematic procedure for the development of RTDT of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is described in detail. The proposed RTDT of a physical RESS test-bed gives flexibility to modify, scale and replicate the system without compromising its real-time fidelity. The development procedure can be easily replicated to develop RTDT of any CPS or micro-grid test-beds. To minimize RTDT development cost, single board computer with Simulink Desktop Real-Time is used instead of using expensive real-time simulators. The CEMS graphical user interface of the RTDT gives flexibility to control interconnected RESSs via the internet cloud. An experimental case study is presented to verify the performance of the RTDT. The RTDT is developed for a commercially available RESS and CEMS, and not for a theoretical system.},

Through the dynamic acquisition, feature awareness, and deep learning, intelligent digital twin-based attack detection can address these issues and enhance attack identification for IoT threats. Thus, this paper proposed an intelligent digital twin method based on spatio-temporal feature fusion for IoT attack behavior identification. Firstly, feature subsets are selected based on information gain to reduce the dimensionality of IoT data with high traffic; Secondly, a parallel spatio-temporal feature extraction model is designed unlike the existing tandem model, which uses a simplified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to learn the spatial features of the attack, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to learn the temporal features of the attack, an attention mechanism to fuse the temporal and spatial features, and the (Deep Neural Networks) DNN to learn the combined features; Finally, the virtual instance space and topology of the attack scenario are simulated using digital twin (DT) to build a digital version of the complex system for IoT applications and tested in a simulation environment. Based on experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets, this paper shows that the proposed method can extract spatio-temporal features from network attack traffic and has a 5% improvement in test accuracy.},

  abstract={The attacks and defenses in industrial control system(ICS) security has been in an asymmetrical situation. Due to the closeness, specificity and complexity of ICS, it has more vulnerabilities and deeper hidden backdoors. The traditional “remedy” type of defense is difficult to prevent increasingly complex attack methods. Starting from the attack chain model, this paper analyzes shortcomings of traditional ICS defense technology, and proposes an ICS security system structure based on mimic defense. Digital twin technology is used to build executive entities of mimic defense model, and increase the dynamic and heterogeneity of ICS. The system structure based on mimic defense has better protection against unknown vulnerabilities, and reduces the probability of being attacked successfully, improve the ICS's ability to withstand attacks through endogenous security at the system level, and alleviate the passive and lagged situation of ICS defense.},

  abstract={Recently, the proposed Cybertwin-driven 6G network architecture has attracted attentions from academia, which can support the communication anchor, security agent and other functions for physical devices. Especially, Cybertwin can provide promising Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications in future. However, security and privacy of Cybertwin still face various threats and challenges, which may impact future deployments for Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X. In this paper, we first introduce the architecture and promising applications of Cybertwin-driven 6G V2X.

The digital twins replicate key functionality of the corresponding infrastructures and allow to play out security scenarios in a safe environment. We show that this capability can be used to automate the process of finding effective security policies for a target infrastructure. In our approach, a digital twin of the target infrastructure is used to run security scenarios and collect data. The collected data is then used to instantiate simulations of Markov decision processes and learn effective policies through reinforcement learning, whose performances are validated in the digital twin. This closed-loop learning process executes iteratively and provides continuously evolving and improving security policies. We apply our approach to an intrusion response scenario.

  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={26358-26374},
  abstract={Digital Twins (DTs) have been gaining popularity in various applications, such as smart manufacturing, smart energy, smart mobility, and smart healthcare. In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.},

  abstract={Increased outsourcing of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and fabrication combined with malicious hardware security threats such as contactless optical probing have greatly decreased an attacker’s difficulty in reverse engineering or maliciously modifying a given circuit. This has become a significant concern for the safety and security of the semiconductor industry. Physical inspection techniques have been used to validate the IC hardware integrity and detect security threats to address these concerns. However, most physical inspection methods for ICs rely upon removing unwanted epoxy packaging material without damaging the device under test (DUT). Therefore, the precise removal of the IC packaging guided by knowledge of the packaging structure is very important for efficiency and accuracy in this process. Currently, IC structure analysis depends on using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), which is time-consuming and lacks the spatial resolution necessary for characterizing advanced heterogeneous packages. For hardware assurance purposes, the entire volume of a device must be analyzed with high efficacy. Additionally, various packaging and the recently adopted 2.5D and 3D advanced packages bring more challenges to meet assurance requirements. Hybrid metrology, which is the combined use of inspection methods for characterization, has the potential to address the inspection challenges for advanced packaging. In this paper, a novel hybridized inspection method utilizing nondestructive THz time-domain spectrum (THz-TDS) and X-ray CT of the IC package is used to create a digital twin (DT) of the sample. The combined characterization can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and accuracy for high quality sample preparation. Hybrid inspection paired with automated sample preparation can reduce the time and operator input needed for complete verification of a large volume of samples. In this paper, the method of generating a digital twin of the IC internal regions of interest (ROI) will be introduced. Analysis of the generated digital twin is used to optimize the material removal necessary for IC verification without damaging the ROI. This inspection and removal methodology can be automated using boundary conditions from the design information of the IC package. Hybrid inspection provides the high spatial resolution thickness and geometry information for generating an automated material removal routine. This provides access to the sample’s ROI for further FIB plasma delayering and SEM verification.},

  abstract={The scale and complexity of cyber threats in digital enterprises hamper operators' ability to gather, prioritize and rationalize which security controls requirements should be handled first to achieve rapid risk reduction. This paper presents a cyber digital twin, based on attack graph analytics, that automatically gathers and prioritizes security controls requirements at scale over active networks. The first-of-a-kind twin collects information about the computer network, associates it with attack tactics, measures the efficiency of implemented security controls requirements and automatically detects missing security controls. The twin also evaluates a cyber risk value using the attack graph and proposes prioritization of the detected requirements to rapidly reduce risk within existing system constraints. The cyber digital twin simulator offers several new risk reduction methods for automatically selecting security controls requirements. The necessary data for constructing a contextual cyber digital twin is defined, including the relationship between security controls and attack tactics. The paper illustrates the calculations used for ranking security controls' risk impact, the algorithm for security controls' requirements prioritization, and finally demonstrates successful results using a field experiment conducted via an active network.},

  abstract={Recently, the Digital Twin (DT) technology has procured a lot of attention because of its applicability in the manufacturing and space industries. The DT environment involves the formation of a clone of the tangible object to perform simulations in the virtual space. The combination of conceptual development, predictive maintenance, real-time monitoring, and simulation characteristics of DT has increased the utilization of DT in different scenarios, such as medical environments, healthcare, manufacturing industries, aerospace, etc. However, these utilizations have also brought serious security pitfalls in DT deployment. Towards this, several authentication protocols with different security and privacy features for DT environments have been proposed. In this article, we first review a recently proposed two-factor authentication protocol for DT environments that utilizes the blockchain technology. However, the analyzed scheme is unable to offer the desirable security and cannot withstand various security attacks like offline password-guessing attack, smart card stolen attack, anonymity property, and known session-specific temporary information attack. We also demonstrate that an attacker can impersonate the analyzed protocol’s legal user, owner, and cloud server. To mitigate these security loopholes, we devise an effective three-factor privacy-preserving authentication scheme for DT environments. The proposed work is demonstrated to be secure by performing the informal security analysis, the formal security analysis using the widely recognized Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and the Real-or-Random (ROR) model. A detailed comparative study on existing competing schemes including the analyzed scheme demonstrates that the devised framework furnishes better security features while also having lower computation costs and comparable communication costs than the existing schemes.},

In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare.

In order to keep pace with the rapidly growing demand of neutral-party security testing of vehicular systems, novel approaches are needed. This paper therefore presents a methodology to create and execute cybersecurity test cases on the fly in a black box setting by using pattern matching-based binary analysis and translation mechanisms to formal attack descriptions as well as model-checking techniques.

  abstract={The CPS technology based on the digital twin provides a dynamic and accurate digital model and real-time control of equipment for the construction of the smart grid. However, integrating physical and information sides makes the power grid CPS system vulnerable to attacks from the network and physical sensors, which brings new challenges to communication security. From the perspective of collaborative, secure communication, this paper proposes a secure transmission scheme for power grid CPS based on physical layer security and deep reinforcement learning. Grid transmission nodes select idle trusted devices as relay transmission nodes. Signals are transmitted between nodes through narrow directional beams, which alleviates blocking effects and prevents eavesdroppers from obtaining good eavesdropping capacity. We use the multi-agent dual-dueling deep Q-network algorithm (D3QN) to optimize the selection of cooperative nodes, maximizing the total secrecy ability as the optimization objective. The simulation experiment proves that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the secrecy ability of CPS nodes.},

  abstract={Although the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are yet to be fully investigated, the visionaries of the 6th generation (6G) echo systems have already come into the discussion. Therefore, in order to consolidate and solidify the security and privacy in 6G networks, we survey how security may impact the envisioned 6G wireless systems, possible challenges with different 6G technologies, and the potential solutions. We provide our vision on 6G security and security key performance indicators (KPIs) with the tentative threat landscape based on the foreseen 6G network architecture. Moreover, we discuss the security and privacy challenges that may encounter with the available 6G requirements and potential 6G applications. We also give the reader some insights into the standardization efforts and research-level projects relevant to 6G security. In particular, we discuss the security considerations with 6G enabling technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), physical layer security, distributed AI/ML, visible light communication (VLC), THz, and quantum computing. All in all, this work intends to provide enlightening guidance for the subsequent research of 6G security and privacy at this initial phase of vision towards reality.},

  abstract={With the increasing complexity of the driving environment, more and more attention has been paid to the research on improving the intelligentization of traffic control. Among them, the digital twin-based internet of vehicle can establish a mirror system on the cloud to improve the efficiency of communication between vehicles, provide warning and safety instructions for drivers, avoid driving potential dangers. To ensure the security and effectiveness of data sharing in traffic control, this paper proposes a secure and privacy-preserving scheme for digital twin-based traffic control. Specifically, in the data uploading phase, we employ a group signature with a time-bound keys technique to realize data source authentication with efficient members revocation and privacy protection, which can ensure that data can be securely stored on cloud service providers after it synchronizes to its twin. In the data sharing stage, we employ the secure and efficient attribute-based access control technique to provide flexible and efficient data sharing, in which the parameters of a specific sub-policy can be stored during the first decryption and reused in subsequent data access containing the same sub-policy, thus reducing the computing complexity. Finally, we analyze the security and efficiency of the scheme theoretically.},

  pages={107574-107588},
  abstract={The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

  abstract={The term Digital Twin (DT) is highly prevalent in manufacturing organizations and academic research. A DT is a virtual representation of a physical entity that mirrors its states and properties. According to common definitions, a true DT has the ability to change its physical entity. In practice, however, implementations are often only subcategories, such as Digital Models (DM) or Digital Shadows (DS). The maturity level of claimed implementations varies among different sectors in manufacturing. This article uses the aerospace and automotive industries as examples to highlight challenges that prevent the DT from widespread use. Based on 21 expert interviews with representatives from senior executives to lower management from 9 different companies, consisting of aerospace and automotive OEMs and top management consulting firms, a qualitative content analysis (QCA) was conducted. As a result, 15 main challenges to the application of DTs were identified and grouped into 3 clusters: technical, organizational, and methodological. The findings emphasize the importance of human factors and adequate change management. Ultimately, 4 measures were extracted that help to overcome these challenges and increase effectiveness of DT application.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart cities to keep the health and reliability of various DT requesters, such as private vehicles, public transportation, energy systems, etc. The combination of DT and ITS can further release the potential of participants in smart cities and guarantee their efficiency and reliability. Despite the advantages of DT-enabled ITS, not all requesters need the same level of DT service due to the highly dynamic nature of ITS. Safe and reliable matching between DT and ITS still needs to be resolved. To address these issues, we propose the blockchain-enabled Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) for ITS. First, we propose an on-demand DTaaS architecture to fully utilize the sensing capabilities of ITS and the macro perspective of DT. Second, a double-auction model and a price adjustment algorithm are proposed to realize the optimal DT matching for ITS requesters and ensure the benefits of participants. Third, a permissioned blockchain and a novel DT-DPoS consensus mechanism are established to enhance the security and efficiency of DTaaS. Simulation shows that the proposed DTaaS and double-auction can efficiently stimulate and facilitate DT transactions. The proposed DT-DPoS also has obvious advantages.},

VDT can effectively address the current shortcomings of the autonomous vehicle and provide enhanced and scalable services to the users. Nevertheless, strict security and privacy concerns arise, as VDT collects a wide range of privacy-sensitive information of the users in real-time and is exposed to an open network environment in both physical and virtual horizons. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy of VDT. We first describe the vehicular digital twin network architecture in detail and then investigate some VDT-related applications. After that, we discuss the security and privacy issues in VDT. Finally, we put forward several potential countermeasures and open research issues for VDT from the perspective of security and privacy.

Recent studies discuss the possibility of using digital twins for intrusion detection in industrial systems. Accordingly, this study contributes to a digital twin-based security framework for industrial control systems, extending its capabilities for simulation of attacks and defense mechanisms. Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection, based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds). This study also discusses the practicality and benefits of the proposed digital twin-based security framework.},

However, there is a growing concern among users regarding the security risks associated with CPS. Especially with rising number of cyber-attacks on CPS, such as modifying sensor readings, interrupting operations, etc. Therefore, this paper describes a security surveillance framework to detect deviations in the ecosystem by incorporating a digital twin supported anomaly detection model. The reason for incorporating digital twins is that they add value by enabling real-time monitoring of connected smart farms. We pre-process the collected data from sensors deployed on the smart farm setup. The pre-processed data is fused with our smart farm ontology to populate a knowledge graph. The generated graph is further queried to extract the necessary sensor data. We utilize the extracted normal data to train the anomaly detection model. Further, we tested our model if it identifies abnormal values from sensors by simulating anomalous use case scenarios specific to our ecosystem.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration has led to more flexible and reliable vehicle-to-grid-enabled cyber-physical systems (V2G-CPSs). However, the increasing system complexity also makes them more vulnerable to cyber-physical threats. Coordinated cyber attacks (CCAs) have emerged as a major concern, requiring effective detection and mitigation strategies within V2G-CPSs. Digital twin (DT) technologies have shown promise in mitigating system complexity and providing diverse functionalities for complex tasks such as system monitoring, analysis, and optimal control. This paper presents a resilient and secure framework for CCA detection and mitigation in V2G-CPSs, leveraging a smart DT-enabled approach. The framework introduces a smarter DT orchestrator that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (LSTM-DRL) in the DT virtual replica. The LSTM algorithm estimates the system states, which are then used by the DRL network to detect CCAs and take appropriate actions to minimize their impact. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed smart DT framework, case studies are conducted on an IEEE 30 bus system-based V2G-CPS, considering different CCA types such as malicious V2G node or control command attacks. The results demonstrate that the framework is capable of accurately estimating system states, detecting various CCAs, and mitigating the impact of attacks within 5 seconds.},

Construction-oriented digital twin technology can improve the efficiency and safety of site management. Designing a construction-oriented digital twin system is a complex process, requiring the design of the modules that implement the digital twin to ensure system viability. Furthermore, it is necessary to design system functions and interactions according to user needs to ensure the humanization of the system. This paper starts from these two aspects, theoretically builds the construction-oriented digital twin module, preliminarily designs the system prototype, and experimentally tests its usability. The innovations of this paper include the following points: 1. Combine digital twin technology with infrastructure construction safety management; 2. Gain insight into the pain points and needs of safety officers to study the design principles and specifications of digital twin technology in new scenarios; 3. Explore the UX (User Experience) design of the interactive interface of the digital twin system. The research results of this paper have reference value for the practice of digital twin interaction design.},

  abstract={The paper explores the issue of multiple-user fairness of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted physical layer security (PLS) in the digital twin (DT)-enabler power grid. Previous research works have focused on achieving secrecy rate fairness through beamforming or phase shift optimization. However, in the DT-enabler power grid, the secrecy rate is not available as the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the passive eavesdropper is unknown. To address these challenges, we apply an expression for secrecy outage probability, measured based on the statistical CSI of the eavesdropper for the scenario where multiple DT users are present. Using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at the transmitter, we formulate the problem of achieving fairness in secrecy outage probability, and then solve it by optimizing the phase shift matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve higher fairness among users in comparison to existing IRS-assisted PLS schemes.},

  abstract={Digital twin technology today is diverse and emerging and its full potential is not yet widely understood. The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration. In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence.},

  abstract={With the new industrial revolution of digital transformation, more intelligence and autonomous systems can be adopted in the manufacturing transportation processes. Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry.},

  abstract={Today's software and hardware technologies enable the expansion of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) into the realms of mobility (car2x, autonomous driving), energy (power plants, smart grid) and healthcare (health monitoring), paving the way into a highly interlaced world. However, this also dramatically broadens the threat landscape for potential attacks on CPSs. The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major fnancial loss. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems. In order to tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a method called INSpIRA, a method for INtegrating Security Into Risk Assessment, including a toolchain implementing the method. The envisioned method is supposed to be a holistic approach that supports the efcient crossdomain design, development, implementation and maintenance of dependable CPSs, where security and safety are a critical aspect that requires an in-depth risk assessment.},

  abstract={The reliability of dc link capacitors is closely related to the operational safety of the whole power electronic system. To meet the application requirements, it is usually necessary to use a series or parallel structure of multiple capacitors to increase the capacity and withstand voltage, which also makes it difficult to monitor the individual capacitors in the capacitor bank. This article proposed a digital twin system for dc-link capacitor banks with PCB integrated Rogowski coils as sensors. The system uses highly integrated Rogowski coils to obtain the operating currents of individual capacitors in order to realize parameter correction of the digital twin system and ensure that the digital twin system can accurately reflect the electrothermal behavior of the dc-link capacitor bank. In addition, the effect of operating temperature on capacitor parameters is also considered, and the capacitor parameters and the operating temperature monitored by the digital twin system simultaneously are used to standardize the parameters. The standardized parameters are used as indicators to realize the health status assessment of each capacitor in the capacitor bank, which further provide an important basis for operation and maintenance.},

  abstract={While sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to bring about an explosion of accessible user information and novel technologies, along with new threats to terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, major concerns associated with the development of 6G networks are privacy and security. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which have recently emerged as promising candidates to support 6G physical platforms, have proved to be capable of boosting security of next-generation wireless systems. However, due to their easy reconfigurability and low cost, RISs are vulnerable to several security threats, and this vulnerability has not yet been thoroughly addressed in previous research. To fill this gap in the literature, in this review, we aim to thoroughly analyze the security challenges affecting RIS-empowered 6G wireless networks. To this end, we review the attributes of RISs that distinguish them from other relevant technologies, such as multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), conventional relaying, backscatter communication (BackCom), as well as outline security and privacy attacks in RIS-assisted 6G applications. Our specific focus is on security and privacy threats associated with the use of RISs with different vital 6G technologies, including millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), device-to-device (D2D) communication, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, multi-access edge computing (MEC), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and non-terrestrial network. The review concludes with an outline of open research challenges and promising future directions to further increase secrecy of RIS-assisted 6G applications. The results of this review contribute to previous research on 6G network security, in general, and RIS-based 6G network security, in particular.},

  abstract={The Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a key enabling technology for efficient and intelligent network management in modern communication networks. Learning dynamic net-work behaviors at the flow granularity is a core element for realizing DTN with accurate network modelling. However, it is challenging due to the complexity of network architectures and the proliferation of emerging network applications. In this paper, we devise a Packet-Action Sequence Model to represent all possible packets behaviors in a unified way. Besides, we propose a novel and effective algorithm to assess whether the behavior pattern is time dependent or independent by using the temporal characteristics of packets in a network flow, so as to learn the key factors of packets that contribute to network behaviors. Based on two typical scenarios, i.e., packet caching and routing, the experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can identify network behavior patterns and learn key factors affecting the behaviors with over 99 % accuracy.},

  pages={713-718},
  abstract={Smart inverters connected to a communication network are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, a self-security approach is implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. The digital twin is formed using the inverter’s normal operating region and the inverter’s dynamic model. Then, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates how the inverter’s normal operating region and dynamic model are formed. In particular, the normal operation region is experimentally verified by changing the P and Q setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 1.5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter and a 12-kW NHR 9410 regenerative power grid emulator. The results demonstrate that the self-security technique can potentially protect inverters from man-in-the-middle attacks by examining the incoming commands (new setpoints) using the inverter’s digital twin before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

  abstract={The Digital Twin (DT) paradigm has received attention for its potential in diverse industrial sectors like manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, electric grid, and transportation. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as an instantiation of the DT paradigm is proposed by Plattform Industrie 4.0, aiming to exchange asset-related data and services from when the asset is produced to its disposal in an interoperable way involving the key stakeholders. In Industrial Control Systems (ICS), AAS integration can bring about new safety and security concerns. Although there are standards covering safety and security separately, no finalised standard supports safety and security in a combined way. The increase in safety and security concerns because of AAS integration and recent cyber attacks that showed security and safety are interconnected, encourage us to explore one of the earliest activities in system development, requirement specification. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of AAS integration into a use case on safety and security requirements specification according to IEC 62443 and 61511. The results highlight the interconnection of safety and security requirements in the proposed use case due to AAS integration and illustrate security requirements that potentially can affect safety.},

  abstract={The rapid development and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in modern networks and Industry 4.0 have attracted substantial interest from cybersecurity researchers. In this study, we propose a software-defined framework that improves network intrusion detection systems by using manufacturer usage description (MUD) to enhance the behavioral monitoring in IoT networks. We aim to explore whether Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices typically serve a common role in cyber–physical systems, and their communications exhibit predictable patterns that can be defined in MUD profile(s) formally and succinctly. We design a framework that utilizes the concept of digital twins and software-defined networking to improve the security of IIoT environments. The MUD data are profiled, and the actions are evaluated on the network digital twin before they are used in the physical network. The behavioral profiling system is updated in real time, thereby improving the overall system security and compliance to policies in the IoT deployment. Evaluation results show that our solution outperforms existing approaches substantially in terms of attack detection accuracy, predicting security incidents, response time, and resource usage.},

  pages={5721-5734},
  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission of multi-resource heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs) in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) from the perspective of physical layer security. Considering the network heterogeneity, resource constrain, and channel similarity, it is challenging to implement the physical layer security in SAGIN. Particularly, digital twin (DT) is considered in the cyberspace of SAGIN to reflect the physical network entities (i.e., satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial base station), which is assumed to comprehensively control and manage the heterogeneous RANs’ resources. To ensure secure transmissions of multi-tier heterogeneous downlink communications in SAGIN, a multi-point symbiotic security scheme is proposed through DT-assisted multi-dimensional domain synergy precoding, where the co-channel interference due to spectrum sharing among these heterogeneous RANs is recast to unevenly corrupt the main and wiretap channels of each legitimate user. Specifically, to realize the multi-point symbiotic security, a max-min problem is formulated to maximize the minimum secrecy rate of three heterogeneous downlinks. Since this problem is non-convex and challenging, a list of mathematical reformulations is derived and the successive convex approximation (SCA) based multi-dimensional domain synergy precoding algorithm is proposed to solve it. Moreover, the computational complexity of our proposed approach is analyzed and meaningful discussions are made. In addition, extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the secrecy rate performance and verify the efficiency of our proposed approach.},

  abstract={Digital Twin is a driving technology for Industry 4.0 that enables novel capabilities like smart process control, fault detection, or remaining useful life estimation. Since a Digital Twin is an up-to-date representation of an actual physical process, building this model requires exchanging many datasets from the physical assets. Usually, it is performed on external servers within a cloud-computig architecture that communicates physical assets with the digital twin model. However, the cloud exchange introduces transmission delays and security and data privacy issues that hamper digital asset updates and create safety concerns. Hence, we propose an FPGA-based digital twin implementation where the datasets are taken directly from the physical asset running parallel to the digital asset. This setup eliminates the need for big data and cloud upload, ensuring data privacy and faster, efficient digital twin implementation and update. A case study is implemented to demonstrate embedded Digital Twin capabilities for monitoring mechatronic systems under fault events.},

  abstract={With the rapidly evolving technological landscape, the huge development of the Internet of Things, and the embracing of digital transformation, the world is witnessing an explosion in data generation and a rapid evolution of new applications that lead to new, wider, and more sophisticated threats that are complex and hard to be detected. Advanced persistence threats use continuous, clandestine, and sophisticated techniques to gain access to a system and remain hidden for a prolonged period of time, with potentially destructive consequences. Those stealthy attacks are often not detectable by advanced intrusion detection systems (e.g., LightBasin attack was detected in 2022 and has been active since 2016). Indeed, threat actors are able to quickly and intelligently alter their tactics to avoid being detected by security defense lines (e.g., prevention and detection mechanisms). In response to these evolving threats, organizations need to adopt new proactive defense approaches. Threat hunting is a proactive security line exercised to uncover stealthy attacks, malicious activities, and suspicious entities that could circumvent standard detection mechanisms. Additionally, threat hunting is an iterative approach to generate and revise threat hypotheses endeavoring to provide early attack detection in a proactive way. The proactiveness consists of testing and validating the initial hypothesis using various manual and automated tools/techniques with the objective of confirming/refuting the existence of an attack. This survey studies the threat hunting concept and provides a comprehensive review of the existing solutions for Enterprise networks. In particular, we provide a threat hunting taxonomy based on the used technique and a sub-classification based on the detailed approach. Furthermore, we discuss the existing standardization efforts. Finally, we provide a qualitative discussion on current advances and identify various research gaps and challenges that may be considered by the research community to design concrete and efficient threat hunting solutions.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 is having an increasingly positive impact on the value chain by modernizing and optimizing the production and distribution processes. In this streamline, the digital twin (DT) is one of the most cutting-edge technologies of Industry 4.0, providing simulation capabilities to forecast, optimize and estimate states and configurations. In turn, these technological capabilities are encouraging industrial stakeholders to invest in the new paradigm, though an increased focus on the risks involved is really needed. More precisely, the deployment of a DT is based on the composition of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, the Industrial Internet of Things, edge computing, virtualization infrastructures, artificial intelligence and big data. However, the confluence of all these technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart of the DT in the real world generate multiple security threats that have not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes the current state of the DT paradigm and classifies the potential threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the appropriate and trustworthy use of a DT.},

  abstract={This paper proposes the parameter tuning methods for building the dynamic Digital Twin of generation unit in the power grid. Recently, the Digital Twin is paid more attention to its application in the digitalization of power grid, which could improve the accuracy for state monitoring, support the security assessment and operate the predictive simulation to assist the operator for the optimization of the power system. To achieve them, the investigation of the method for building the Digital Twin is essential. This paper provides four methods for dynamically parameterizing the Digital Twin to keep its adaptivity. The parameter tuning is the sine qua non to keep the Digital Twin alive with the dynamically regulating the parameters for the replication of the physical system feature. To investigate the efficiency for building the Digital Twin by these methods, the Cigré benchmark is utilized as the standard physical power grid. The fourth-order synchronous generator is applied for building the Digital Twin with the parameter estimation methods. The results of the parameter estimation show that two of them have high performance in estimating the parameters for Digital Twin.},

  year={2023},
  volume={22},
  number={4},
  pages={2402-2416},
  abstract={The emergence of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DTENs) achieves the mapping of real physical entities to digital models of cyberspace. By offloading real-time mobile data to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers for processing and modeling, communication-efficient Digital Twin (DT) services could be achieved. However, the spatio-temporal dynamic DT service demand stochastically generated by mobile users easily causes service congestion, which challenges the long-term DT service stability. Meanwhile, current DT services still lack long-term effective incentive designs for participants. To solve these issues, we design an incentive-based congestion control scheme for stochastic demand response in DTENs. First, we adopt the Lyapunov optimization theory to decompose the long-term congestion control decision into a sequence of online edge association decisions, with no need for future system information. We then present a contract-based incentive design to optimize the long-term profit of the DT service provider, comprehensively considering the delay sensitivity, incentive compatibility, and individual rationality. Finally, experimental simulations are carried out to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme with the base station dataset of Shanghai Telecom. Theoretical and simulation analysis demonstrates that compared with benchmarks, our scheme could effectively avoid long-term service congestion with an arbitrarily near-optimal profit.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Along with the advent of COVID-19 epidemic, delivery services have become one of the most common services in our daily life. However, the current services merely assume that the contact for handing over delivery items is denied to avoid facing between carriers and receivers. This extreme concept might lead to the ruin of typical processes for delivery services, such as face-to-face authentication, item checking, and payment in person. So, it may cause insufficiency regarding both sides of the secure item delivery and customers’ personal security. Therefore, this paper comes up with a novel CONTACTFUL delivery service with the digital twin paradigm to resolve contactless problems. The proposed idea establishes two-tier digital twin architecture to arrange digital twins and physical twins of carriers and receivers. Then, inter-digital-twin interaction virtually supports on-site delivery service processes. The inter-twin interaction relies on highly accurate proximity detection for items, carriers, and receivers. So, the proposed scheme considers machine-learning technologies and filtering algorithms to achieve high precision based on mobile-based Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beaconing. This scheme is implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype, and various field data are exploited to build ML-filtering models including their ensemble one. On the steel door, the ensemble model shows an accuracy improvement of 65% compared to SVM, 14% to CNN, and 73% to MLP. On the wood door, the ensemble model shows an accuracy improvement of 21% compared to SVM, 9% to CNN, and 17% to MLP.},

Digital twins greatly expand the possibilities in the training of automated control system engineers, allowing them to interact with virtual simulators of any scale without risk to real equipment. This paper introduces the possibility of using such systems as a simulator for training control engineers is considered. A modern game engine and simulation platform were used to develop a similar training complex, which is a virtual control object for training engineers in the field of process control systems. An application with a virtual control plant has been developed, which allows debugging the project under development. The process of developing an object control program is significantly simplified, as it helps to visually control and test the program being developed.},

  abstract={Reducing costs and increasing manufacturing output while creating reliable products are three essential components needed to keep a business competitive. In the past, having an asset that could address these three challenges at the same time would be challeging. However, recent advances in computer processing capabilities coupled with increases to network speeds allowed such a system to become possible; and this is known as a Digital Twin (DT), which represents a virtual copy of a production system or a product. This work exhibits a DT application of an Active Neutral Point Clamped (ANPC) inverter using a controller. The controller emulates the ANPC responses of a new Digital Signal Processing (DSP) firmware and validates this new firmware by using Design-For-Trust (DFTr) characteristics. If the new firmware is malicious, then it should be rejected, thus adding preemptive protection measures for inverter based distributed energy resources.},

  abstract={The complexity of the number of stakeholders, information systems used, and port operations evoke new challenges to port security when it comes to the total knowledge and control of the overall operations of transport and parking of containerized freight, namely hazmat ones.The rising interest and the port authorities' awareness of the relevance of security concerns involved in this complex ecosystem has led to the search for new technological solutions that allow, in an integrated manner, the smart and automatic control of operations of transport and hazardous freight parking in all the areas of its jurisdiction, without third-party dependencies.Despite its importance and criticality, port authorities tend to have limited real-time knowledge of the location of hazmat containers, whether moving within the port (entering and leaving), or in its parking, having a direct impact on the port security.This article presents a Digital Twin platform for 3D and real-time georeferenced visualization of container parks and the location of hazardous containerized freight. This tool combines different modules that further allow to visualize information associated to a container, its movement, as well as its surrounding area, including a realistic and dynamic 3D representation of what is the area encircling the port.},

First, we analyze the phase current displacement and earth current in single-phase and three-phase tripped conditions and their dependence on system impedance parameters. We then show the effects on the conventional distance protection algorithm and give worst case estimates for the reduction of measured impedance in asymmetrical cases. Simulations using PSCAD and a Digital Twin of Siemens distance relays are presented to give a good assessment of relay behavior and protection security. Lastly, we discuss possible solutions like reduced zone-reach of phase-to-earth loops and use of reactance method.},

  abstract={In this paper, the development of a mathematical model for islanding detection method based on the concept of a digital twin is presented. The model estimates the grid impedance seen by a distributed energy resource. The proposed algorithm has characteristics of passive and active islanding detection methods. Using a discrete state-space representation of a dq0 axis power system as equality constraints, a digital twin is optimized to match the power system of interest. The concept is to use the estimated grid impedance as the parameter to identify the difference between normal operation and islanding scenarios. Selecting arbitrary initial values, the digital twin approximates the response of the actual system and therefore a value for the system impedance. Results indicate that the proposed method has the potential to estimate the grid impedance at the point of common coupling.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoTs) has been a burgeoning field that transforms the ubiquitous objects to interconnected devices and intelligent system. Today, with the emerging of innovative technologies such as cloud computing, the IoT sector is in a race to leverage these novel technologies to achieve optimal performance. Naturally the Digital Twins (DTs) architecture acts as an indispensable intermediary bridge to couple the IoT domain with these lastest technologies together. However, a tremendous obstacle is that the current Revocable Attribute-Based Encryption (RABE) schemes applied in the DTs paradigm fail to balance the efficiency, security and scalability simultaneously. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by presenting an unbounded and efficient direct RABE scheme with adaptive security. Compared with the previous schemes in this domain, our approach achieves revocable and fine-grained access control efficiently by employing the arithmetic span program (ASP) as the access structure. In this way, the expensive bilinear pairing and exponentiation operations are reduced significantly. Moreover, the unbounded property is satisfied in our scheme since the parameters are not required to be predefined in the setup phase. At last, with the support of the Matrix Decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption, the proposed scheme is proved to achieve adaptive security by adopting dual system encryption methodology. Theoretical comparison and implementation results demonstrate our proposed scheme possesses prominent practicability, scalability and efficiency.},

  abstract={Digital twins (DT) have been proposed to support and enhance manufacturing processes of the industries. The outcome of adopting DT is so encouraging that it is hoped that more than 50% of the large industries will benefit from DT by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, DT lacks a single publicly accepted narrative. In order to help researchers for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction confirmation. This article also presents a framework for deployment of twinchain for manufacturing of a robot surgical machine.},
