  abstract={The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE), developed by the Department of Defense, provides a single training environment for cyberspace operations. PCTE offers a closed network that supports individual training as well as mission rehearsal and post-operation analysis. However, it does not have the ability to replay near real-time events as training scenarios, nor to ingest other network events as scenarios. Replaying cyber mission data on a digital twin network in PCTE would enable more realistic near real-time operator training, as well as supporting development and testing for cyberspace operations. This requires extracting target network specifications from a cyber mission data set. This research developed a prototype tool to extract the network specifications necessary to instantiate a digital twin network within PCTE from cyber mission data. A key contribution of this work is the ability, upon sending recorded network data to the tool, to create a high-fidelity network, and scenario for training purposes. This contribution enables a significant decrease in the time from detection of a problem on a live network to the creation of relevant training scenarios that address the detected problem.},

  abstract={In this manuscript we describe the implementation of a digital twin for industrial networks. The aim is to provide a playground for cyber-security analysis and validation without the risk of interfering to any extent with the real cyber-physical system and its environment. The proposed implementation methodology provides a very high degree of automation, following the telecom-oriented NFV-MANO approach, and shows that different network topologies may be activated in a matter of just a few minutes. Each topology may then be used as a sort of cyber-range for the experimentation of possible attacks and validation of related countermeasures.},

  abstract={The rapid adoption of automation in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is triggering Industry 4.0 (I4.0), integrating cloud computing, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and universal network connectivity into traditionally isolated systems. These I4.0 changes are optimizing the performance of Smart Manufacturing (SM) systems at the cost of increased complexity, exposing I4.0 systems to more cyberattacks than ever before. To address these challenges, this work presents DT4I4-Secure: A Digital Twin Framework for Industry 4.0 Security. The DT4I4-Secure presents a framework to create Digital Twins (DT) for I4.0 systems using a combination of models (including physics and data-based models). This paper showcases the use of the DT framework to detect attacks on I4.0 systems by comparing observations with future predictions from the DT. This paper evaluates the performance of the DT4I4-Secure for a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) turning process manufacturing a metallic spool, wherein the experimental results show the model can predict normal operations with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.005081. This work also explores using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) based dynamic threshold instead of a traditional static threshold for attack detection when the CNC turning process is under three separate attack scenarios. The DT4I4-Secure combined with the dynamic threshold shows a 3.46 times improvement in F1-Scores over all three attack scenarios for instantaneous attack detection while having 100% accuracy during the manufacturing cycle.},

  abstract={The core of digital twin is the digital reconstruction of physical space, that is the physical space perception and processed data are applied to the virtual space to achieve real-time mapping of physical space through full integration of data. With the rapid development of digital twin technology in the power field, in order to achieve the purpose of real-time data fusion of physical space and virtual space in the digital twin of distribution network, the virtual and real data fusion processing technology for digital twin has become the focus of research in the power field.

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the secure vehicle communications in cybertwin-enabled integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, where the digital twins (DTs) in the cybertwin space reflects the physical entities (i.e., satellite, terrestrial base station (BS), and vehicles). Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links, it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract={The edge of the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is vulnerable to network intrusion because software and wireless connections are used extensively in the IoT. Designing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) model is imperative. However, when creating IDS models with distributed data collected by UAVs, it is necessary to take precautions to protect the data’s security and privacy. Furthermore, most of the IDS models are focused on one-time learning but not on continuous learning. To this end, we propose a federated continuous learning framework with a stacked broad learning system (FCL-SBLS) based on the digital twin network (DTN), which can learn and train the IDS model on new data quickly and continuously. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of the IDS model when training and aggregation, we employ an asynchronous federated learning (FL) architecture, and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based UAV selection scheme assisted by DTN is proposed to help the global IDS model aggregation. The presented algorithm is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 data set, and the simulation results reveal that our algorithm achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing FL scheme.},

In this paper, we consider a DT-enabled federated learning data sharing model, named DTFLDS, where DTs capture the characteristics of shared devices to assist federal training. Federated learning is utilized to keep the data training locally and only share the aggregation model instead of the source data, which ensuring data and privacy security. Noting the reverse attack and privacy leakage in model transmission, a security aggregation algorithm based on secret sharing is proposed to ensure the security and efficiency of model aggregation.

  abstract={AI Planning (or Automated Planning) is a sub-field within AI which has been applied to several information security sub-fields, particularly vulnerability detection and incident response. Compared to other AI techniques such as machine learning, AI planning has the advantage of requiring no data or datasets to train. Instead, an entity within a domain is modelled, describing the relevant features of an environment, the goals, constraints, and the actions available to the entity. This paper surveys the traditional field of automated planning and explores its application to the field of information security and in particular, automating cyber incident response. Relevant AI planning techniques are then applied to implement a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of automating incident response, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) against smart grid as a use case. The effectiveness of this prototype is validated on a digital twin power delivery system at The University of Queensland Industry 4.0 Energy Testlab. The effectiveness of this prototype is quantitatively assessed with reference to best industry practice before discussing the strengths and weaknesses of adopting AI planning for incident response, and information security domains generally.},

Its challenges include the need for accurate and up-to-date data as well as the complexity of integrating different systems and technologies. This paper explores the potential of combining digital twin and blockchain technologies to create next-generation transportation systems that are more efficient, secure, and sustainable. DTs can be used to simulate and optimize transportation operations and maintenance, while blockchain can enhance security and transparency in data exchange and transaction verification. By integrating these technologies, transportation systems can become more resilient, adaptable, and responsive to changing demands and challenges. This paper provides an overview of the key concepts and applications of DTs and blockchain in transportation, including use cases such as autonomous vehicles, smart logistics, and mobility as a service.

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Over the past decade, the number of cyber attack incidents targeting critical infrastructures such as the electrical power system has increased. To assess the risk of cyber attacks on the cyber-physical system, a holistic approach is needed that considers both system layers. However, the existing risk assessment methods are either qualitative in nature or employ probabilistic models to study the impact on only one system layer. Hence, in this work, we propose a quantitative risk assessment method for cyber-physical systems based on probabilistic and deterministic techniques. The former uses attack graphs to evaluate the attack likelihood, while the latter analyzes the potential cyber-physical impact. This is achieved through a dynamic cyber-physical power system model, i.e., digital twin, able to simulate power system cascading failures caused by cyber attacks. Additionally, we propose a domain-specific language to describe the assets of digital substations and thereby model the attack graphs. Using the proposed method, combined risk metrics are calculated that consider the likelihood and impact of cyber threat scenarios. The risk assessment is conducted using the IEEE 39-bus system, consisting of 27 user-defined digital substations. These substations serve as the backbone of the examined cyber system layer and as entry-points for the attackers. Results indicate that cyber attacks on specific substations can cause major cascading failures or even a blackout. Thereby, the proposed method identifies the most critical substations and assets that must be cyber secured.},

  abstract={The human digital twin (HDT) is a new paradigm that possesses the ability to revolutionize the current healthcare systems. With HDT, ensuring an efficient connectivity scheme between each human-virtual twin pair remains a significant problem. As the concept of HDT is new, conventional connectivity schemes cannot meet the unique requirements of HDT in terms of reliability, security and privacy. This paper thus proposes an edge-assisted connectivity scheme for HDT and adopts an integrated blockchain and federated learning techniques to ensure security and privacy. To minimize long-term average connectivity cost, we formulated the connectivity problem as a Markov decision process and adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn the optimal connectivity policy in terms of connectivity cost. The obtained results were then compared with the conventional deep Q-network-based solution. The results show that the proposed DDPG-based connectivity solution is feasible to perform the connectivity process better by optimally allocating system resources, thus reducing the overall connectivity cost, while ensuring data security and privacy.},

It can be used to monitor the real environment, predict its future, control its behavior, and improve its overall performance. Despite the aforementioned advantages of DTs, if not protected, they can also be considered as an open environment for attackers. If attackers take over a DT, they may end up owning the real environment controlled by the DT. This can result in damaging consequences.

Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep- $Q$ -learning (DDQN), respectively.

  abstract={Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning methods.},

  abstract={Inference Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is a methodology developed to address test and evaluation limitations that insider threat detection enterprises face due to a lack of ground truth and/or missing data. IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions. In this work, we use UML Activity Diagrams to leverage the integrated simulation capabilities of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).},

  abstract={In recent years, the cybersecurity attacks on the internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare systems became the major concern for researchers and health organizations. With time, the sophistication of these attacks is increasing. Therefore, healthcare service providers must implement efficient security mechanisms carefully while taking the advantages of connected devices without compromising the patient safety and disturbing the real-time health services. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems. In this paper, a novel and automated conceptual framework is developed for reinforcing the cybersecurity in IoT-based healthcare using DT technology. It includes the conceptualization and analysis of the proposed framework which can provide dynamic and adaptive security solution to identify real-time threats and vulnerabilities in IoTbased healthcare applications.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the problem of minimising latency in computation offloading with digital twin (DT) wireless edge networks for industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment via ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) links. The considered DT-aided edge networks provide a powerful computing framework to enable computation-intensive services, where the DT is used to model the computing capacity of edge servers and optimise the resource allocation of the entire system. The objective function is comprised of local processing latency, URLLC-based transmission latency and edge processing latency, subject to both communication and computation resources budgets. In this regard, the minimum latency is obtained by jointly optimising the transmit power, user association, offloading portions, the processing rate of users and edge servers. The formulated problem is highly complicated due to complex non-convex constraints and strong coupling variables. To deal with this computationally intractable problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which decomposes the original problem into three sub-problems and resolve this problem in the fashion of alternating optimisation approach combined with an inner convex approximation framework. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the latency compared with other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={In this paper the general susceptibilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) against modern-cyber threats are explored and potential solutions proposed. This is achieved by applying digital-twin architectures and data-driven methods to UAVs to facilitate identification of real-time intrusions and anomalies. These concepts are validated by performing novelty detection on open access UAV flight data with GPS spoofing attacks, which represents a typical system use-case. Multiple machine learning models are trained to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting modern cyber-intrusions and anomalies using the digital-twin architecture. This includes both classical and deep learning techniques to help identify the most suitable model types for the proposed design. The overall results are positive and help highlight the potential of digital-twin architectures for the UAV contexts.},

  abstract={The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article, we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.},

  abstract={Future wireless services will focus on improving the quality of life by enabling various applications, such as extended reality, brain-computer interaction, and healthcare. These applications will have diverse performance requirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience metrics, latency, and reliability) which will be challenging to be fulfilled by existing wireless systems. To meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e., design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping, deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air interface design are considered. Finally, open research challenges and opportunities are discussed.},

  pages={3238-3249},
  abstract={Identifying the locations of cyber attacks in power distribution systems is critical to take immediate and effective mitigation actions. This article introduces a novel real-time attack localization strategy for power distribution systems utilizing a Digital Twin (DT) as a cyber-physical real-time reference model that mimics the cyber-physical dynamic characteristics of the actual system. The proposed approach takes advantage of the DT-based reference model as well as the physical characteristics of the radial distribution network to compute a new metric, namely Residual Rate of Change (RRC), which allows differentiating False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on load measurements and protective devices. The RRC enables the determination of the attack's location by constructing a directed graph that characterizes the physical dependencies of protective devices. The proposed attack localization method is implemented on a testbed consisting of a digital real-time simulator, feeder protection devices, a real-time automation controller, and advanced communication infrastructure for a power distribution system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to localize cyber attacks in various operation scenarios of the power distribution system. The results also illustrate that the introduced method outperforms a learning-based strategy in localizing different types of attacks in the test system.},

  abstract={Digital twins have been designed and implemented for diverse applications like smart manufacturing, healthcare, supply chain and retail management. They provide monitoring, remote prognostics and health management capabilities for the various physical assets used in these domains. Many of these capabilities would be beneficial to microservice architectures as well, given the need for lightweight monitoring solutions in multitenant environments. In particular, twins can provide operators with real-time resource usage metrics which help with operational objectives such as resource planning, anomaly detection, rewind and replay and so on. In this work, we propose a design for building digital twins for microservice architectures. As a proof of concept, we focus on modelling the resource utilization as that is a key requirement for monitoring system reliability and security. In general, digital twins require a real world counterpart, a virtual model and a mechanism for consistently keeping both synchronized. We focus on the two latter aspects of the digital twin. Our approach involves converting a formal model of a microservice architecture into a digital twin that can capture and execute an actual cluster's state. We present an extensible architecture connecting the various components of the system and the twin and evaluate the twin's ability to capture the real-time state of a real Kubernetes cluster. We also discuss future extensions which can enhance the system's security by detecting a broad range of attacks.},

  abstract={Due to the distributed collaboration and privacy protection features, federated learning is a promising technology to perform the model training in virtual twins of Digital Twin for Mobile Networks (DTMN). In order to enhance the reliability of the model, it is always expected that the users involved in federated learning have trustworthy behaviors. Yet, available trust evaluation schemes for federated learning have the problems of considering simplex evaluation factor and using coarse-grained trust calculation method. In this paper, we propose a trust evaluation scheme for federated learning in DTMN, which takes direct trust evidence and recommended trust information into account. A user behavior model is designed based on multiple attributes to depict users’ behavior in a fine-grained manner. Furthermore, the trust calculation methods for local trust value and recommended trust value of a user are proposed using the data of user behavior model as trust evidence. Several experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed method is able to evaluate the trust levels of users with different behavior patterns accurately. Moreover, it performs better in resisting attacks from users that alternately execute good and bad behaviors compared with state-of-the-art scheme.

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology that replicates any physical phenomenon from a physical space to a digital space in congruence with the physical state. However, devising a Healthcare DT model for patient care is seen as a challenging task as the lack of adequate data collection structure. There are also security and privacy concerns as healthcare data is very sensitive and can be used in malicious ways. Because of these current research gaps, the proper way of acquiring the structured data and managing them in a secure way is very important. In this article, we present a mathematical data model to accumulate the patient relevant data in a structured and predefined way with proper delineation. Additionally, the provided data model is described in harmony with real life contexts. Then, we have used the patient centric mathematical data model to formally define the semantic and scope of our proposed Healthcare Digital Twin (HDT) system based on Blockchain. Accordingly, the proposed system is described with all the key components as well as with detailed protocol flows and an analysis of its different aspects. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model with a critical comparison with other relevant research works have been provided.},

  abstract={This paper qualitatively explores a Cloud-based Flight Management System, which is a digital twin of an FMS. The Cloud FMS (CFMS) is a type of digital twin that is hosted on a cloud computing environment. Because the CFMS has access to the state of the aircraft on which the FMS is running, it contains a wealth of information not normally available to ground-based aviation systems. In addition, the CFMS can access large amounts of compute power that is unavailable to the flight-deck based FMS. Therefore, the CMFS is in a unique position to compute quantities that were impractical in the past. This paper begins by discussing the CFMS concept some use cases. It ends by discussing additional quantities—such as wake vortex and noise footprints—that can be computed by the CFMS and may lead to enhanced NAS efficiency.},

  abstract={The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) enables digital twin (DT) technology to precisely represent a real product in a virtual space by generating a multitude of IoT data items to record many aspects of the product. To support various DT-based applications, the generated IoT data items need to be shared among multiple parties involving the lifecycle of the product, which raises increasing demand for data access control. The decentralization and tamper-proofing properties of blockchain enable it a promising technology to support immutability protection of shared IoT data items. Meanwhile, to protect the confidentiality of the shared IoT data items, attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be used as a common tool to construct a cryptographic enforced data access control scheme. However, its adoption has been severely hindered by the incompatibility between the immutability of blockchain and secure authority update of cryptographic enforced data access control. In this paper, a blockchain-aware rollbackable data access control scheme (Bdacs) is proposed to reconcile the above tension. Bdacs uses two novel encryption schemes named hierarchical encryption scheme and privacy-preserving rollback re-encryption scheme to realize secure dynamic access control while preserving the immutability of blockchain. We prove the security of Bdacs and evaluate it through theoretical comparison and experimental analysis to confirm its efficiency. This work can serve as a basis of development of future DT-based applications to enable privacy-preserving IoT data-sharing systems deployed on blockchain.},

  abstract={Nowadays, emerging sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile-edge computing (MEC) technologies have played significant roles in developing a sustainable computing network. In sustainable computing networks, with the increasing scale of data-driven applications, massive privacy-sensitive data are generated. How to effectively process such data on resource-limited IoT devices is challenging. Although edge intelligence (EI) is designed to maintain an appropriate level of ultradelay reliability, low-latency communication (URLLC), real-time data processing, and security and privacy are concerning. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-supported hierarchical digital twin IoT (HDTIoT) framework, which combines the digital twin to edge network and adopts blockchain technology to achieve secure and reliable real-time computation. We first propose a data and knowledge dual-driven learning solution to ensure real-time interaction and efficient optimization between the physical and the digital worlds. To improve communication and computation efficiency with data and knowledge dual-driven learning, the optimization goal is to minimize the system delay and energy consumption and ensure system reliability and the learning accuracy of IoT devices. Moreover, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to solve the resource allocation (RA) problem. Experimental results show that the proposed RA scheme can improve the efficiency of the HDTIoT system, guarantee learning accuracy, reliability, and security, and make a balance between system delay and energy consumption.},

  abstract={At present, the traditional substation auxiliary control system is faced with the following four problems: poor real-time capability to abnormal response, high dependence on people when solving malfunctions, the communication, deployment and expansion of different underlying devices, and the lack of security mechanism. To solve these problems or optimize the functions, an intelligent substation auxiliary control system is proposed. The system innovatively applies OPC UA to the construction of the auxiliary control system. First, through the use of OPC UA's unique object-oriented modeling method as well as the joint specification modeling of OPC UA and IEC61850, to solve the data communication problems caused by heterogeneous devices. Second, applying the Client/Server mode to realize the remote access from authorized mobile clients and give instructions, to cope with abnormal conditions, which reduces the dependency on people. Clients of other authorized enterprises are allowed to access the working data of the devices they are interested in, makes full use of massive data and ensures the information security of the system. Third, Pub/Sub mode is applied to enable the underlying devices to communicate directly with each other through the middleware, which reduces the response time of equipment joint debugging and improve the real-time performance. In addition, through OPC UA, the industrial data of the system can be transmitted over the Internet, realizing the combination of the Internet of Things and the Internet, which is an idea of the combination of the two in the future.},

While the concept of DT is not new in itself, the large-scale adoption across the industries is still maturing. The number of DTs deployed will continue to increase significantly1 and will represent components, systems, interactions, people, and even business processes. This will drive the need to connect multiple DTs that can operate seamlessly across systems and business boundaries, forming a collaborative digital ecosystem. The term Composite Digital Twin (CDT) is used to represent this interconnection and integration of DTs. To implement a CDT, several challenges such as trust, interoperability, governance, ownership, security, and privacy need to be addressed. First, this study explores the requirements to create a CDT covering operational, management, and security standpoints. After analyzing CDT requirements, an architecture is proposed to encapsulate the core functional and security requirements to enable emerging collaborative digital ecosystems. The architecture emphasis is placed on security and trust among participants to ensure that developers, providers, and users can have confidence in the services these CDT provide.},

  abstract={Copy detection patterns (CDP) present an efficient technique for product protection against counterfeiting. However, the complexity of studying CDP production variability often results in time-consuming and costly procedures, limiting CDP scalability. Recent advancements in computer modelling, notably the concept of a “digital twin” for printing-imaging channels, allow for enhanced scalability and the optimization of authentication systems. Yet, the development of an accurate digital twin is far from trivial. This paper extends previous research which modelled a printing-imaging channel using a machine learning-based digital twin for CDP. This model, built upon an information-theoretic framework known as “Turbo”, demonstrated superior performance over traditional generative models such as CycleGAN and pix2pix. However, the emerging field of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) presents a potential advancement in generative models due to its ability to stochastically model the inherent randomness of the printing-imaging process, and its impressive performance in image-to-image translation tasks. This study aims at comparing the capabilities of the Turbo framework and DDPM on the same CDP datasets, with the goal of establishing the real-world benefits of DDPM models for digital twin applications in CDP security. Furthermore, the paper seeks to evaluate the generative potential of the studied models in the context of mobile phone data acquisition. Despite the increased complexity of DDPM methods when compared to traditional approaches, our study highlights their advantages and explores their potential for future applications.},

  abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) of critical infrastructure are increasingly connected to the Internet for remote site management at scale. However, cyber attacks against ICS - especially at the communication channels between humanmachine interface (HMIs) and programmable logic controllers(PLCs) - are increasing at a rate which outstrips the rate of mitigation. In this paper, we introduce a vendor-agnostic analytics framework which allows security researchers to analyse attacks against ICS systems, even if the researchers have zero control automation domain knowledge or are faced with a myriad of heterogenous ICS systems. Unlike existing works that require expertise in domain knowledge and specialised tool usage, our analytics framework does not require prior knowledge about ICS communication protocols, PLCs, and expertise of any network penetration testing tool. Using 'digital twin' scenarios comprising industry-representative HMIs, PLCs and firewalls in our test lab, our framework's steps were demonstrated to successfully implement a stealthy deception attack based on false data injection attacks (FDIA). Furthermore, our framework also demonstrated the relative ease of attack dataset collection, and the ability to leverage well-known penetration testing tools. We also introduce the concept of 'heuristic inference attacks', a new family of attack types on ICS which is agnostic to PLC and HMI brands/models commonly deployed in ICS. Our experiments were also validated on a separate ICS dataset collected from a cyber-physical scenario of water utilities. Finally, we utilized time complexity theory to estimate the difficulty for the attacker to conduct the proposed packet analyses, and recommended countermeasures based on our findings.},

  abstract={Digital twins can address the problem of data scarcity during the training machine learning models, as they can be used to simulate and explore a range of process conditions and system states that are too difficult or dangerous to explore in real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Meanwhile, advances in industrial control systems technology have enabled increasingly complex functionality to be deployed on or near so-called edge devices, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).In this paper, we propose a methodology for training a machine learning model offline using data extracted from a digital twin, before converting the model for deployment on an edge device to perform anomaly detection. To examine the model’s suitability for anomaly detection, we execute several simulations of fault conditions. Results show that the model can successfully predict normal operations as well as identify faults and cyber-attacks. There is a negligible drop in performance on the edge device, when compared to executing the model on a personal computer, but it remains suitable for the application.},

  abstract={With the help of modern technologies and advances in communication systems, the functionality of Industrial control systems (ICS) has been enhanced leading toward to have more efficient and smarter ICS. However, this makes these systems more and more connected and part of a networked system. This can provide an entry point for attackers to infiltrate the system and cause damage with potentially catastrophic consequences. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin-based security framework for ICS that consists of two parts: attack detection and attack mitigation. In this framework we deploy an intrusion detection system in digital domain that can detect attacks in a timely manner. Then, using our mitigation method, we keep the system stable with acceptable performance during the attack. Additionally, we implement our framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks.},

  abstract={Digital Twins have been deployed for multiple purposes in Cybersecurity. Cyber-Physical Systems and similar systems are benefited from teaming with this technology. The goal of protecting the main systems or devices is easily reached as Digital Twins are known for their success and flexibility in multitasking and can provide adaptability to any device they clone. honeypots are excellent filtering and protection cyber tools capable of investigating and logging malicious activity around a network or device. This cyber tool mimics any network device or system and lures the attacker into a protected surveillance environment. It is not yet given the freedom, though, to act independently other than managing a few tasks and necessitates human intervention to change tactics or configuration. The framework proposed in this paper combines these two technologies, Digital Twins and honeypot, to fill this gap. The DiTwinIHon framework makes the physical honeypot easily adaptable in any network situation while enhancing its Threat Intelligence and providing additional features for detecting and investigating various threats, such as Advanced Persistent Threats.},

  abstract={With recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT), the bleeding edge concept of digital twin (DT) has enticed the attention of many researchers to revolutionize the entire modern industries. DT concept refers to a digital representation of a physical entity that is able to reflect its physical behavior by applying platforms and bidirectional interaction of data in real-time. The remarkable deployment of the internet of things in the power grid has led to reliable access to information that improves its performance and equips it with a powerful tool for real-time data management and analysis. This paper aims to trace the continuous investigation and propose practical ideas in originating and developing DT technology, according to various application domains of power systems, and also describes the proposed solutions to deal with the challenges associated with DT. Indeed, with the development of modern cities, different energy layers such as transportation systems, smart grids, and microgrids have emerged facing various issues that challenge the multi-dimensional energy management system. For example, in transportation systems, traffic is a major problem that requires real-time management, planning, and analysis. In power grids, remote data transfer within the grid and also various analyzes needing real data are just some of the current challenges in the field. These problems can be cracked by providing and analyzing a real twin framework in each section. All in all, this paper aims to survey different applications of DT in the development of the various aspects of energy management within a city including transportation systems, power grids, and microgrids. Besides, the security of DT technology based on ML is discussed. It also provides a complete view for the readers to be able to develop and deploy a DT technology for various power system applications.},

  abstract={In Industry 4.0, the Digital twin has been widely used in industrial activities. However, the data-driven industry is placing a higher demand on digital twins, especially for the secure sharing and management of data throughout the lifecycle. As a distributed ledger technology, Blockchain is well suited to address these challenges. Unfortunately, current blockchain-based digital twin lifecycle management does not focus on data processing after the retirement stage. In this paper, we propose BDTwins, a blockchain-based digital twin lifecycle management framework, which is built based on our proposed 7D model. In this framework, we make innovative use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) to process the data in the recovery stage of the digital twin. This method solves digital intellectual property disputes and inherits digital twin knowledge completely and stably after the destruction of physical entities. In addition, BDTwins has designed a fine-grained hierarchical access control policy to enable secure data sharing among stakeholders. And solves the performance bottleneck of traditional single-chain blockchain architecture by utilizing directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain and off-chain distributed storage. Finally, we implement a general blockchain-based digital twin case using smart contract technology to demonstrate our proposed digital twin lifecycle management framework.},

  abstract={Motivated by the advancing computational capacity of distributed end-user equipment (UE), as well as the increasing concerns about sharing private data, there has been considerable recent interest in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) that can be processed on distributed UEs. Specifically, in this paradigm, parts of an ML process are outsourced to multiple distributed UEs. Then, the processed information is aggregated on a certain level at a central server, which turns a centralized ML process into a distributed one and brings about significant benefits. However, this new distributed ML paradigm raises new risks in terms of privacy and security issues. In this article, we provide a survey of the emerging security and privacy risks of distributed ML from a unique perspective of information exchange levels, which are defined according to the key steps of an ML process, i.e., we consider the following levels: 1) the level of preprocessed data; 2) the level of learning models; 3) the level of extracted knowledge; and 4) the level of intermediate results. We explore and analyze the potential of threats for each information exchange level based on an overview of current state-of-the-art attack mechanisms and then discuss the possible defense methods against such threats. Finally, we complete the survey by providing an outlook on the challenges and possible directions for future research in this critical area.},

  pages={2368-2381},
  abstract={Rapid technological advancements have resulted in increasingly more efficient and lightweight devices that, coupled with low-power and wide-range wireless connectivity, have given rise to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems. As a result, the concept of intelligent environments was developed, such as smart airports, where ubiquitous sensors seamlessly cooperate through several types of communication technologies, such as WiFi, BLE, ZigBEE and 5G, enable the collection of data and the dynamic adaption of the system to changing circumstances. However, along with certain benefits, such as augmented communication, enhanced business processes and improved efficiency, IIoT introduces new vulnerabilities, enabling cyber-attackers to compromise not only the digital infrastructure of IIoT architecture-enabled smart airports, but also affecting their physical assets. In this paper, we present a novel smart airport cybertwins security-oriented IIoT testbed, named SAir-IIoT, which comprises multiple heterogeneous IIoT devices and communication protocols, organised into distinct zones, automatically interconnected with each other, that can be remotely accessed as-a-service. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cybertwins security-oriented testbed that enables researchers and practitioners to remotely practice attack and defence scenarios in smart airport IIoT environments. Additionally, we introduce a new data management technique for dynamically collecting, analysing and tagging heterogeneous data from diverse data sources including IIoT devices and network flows. Finally, we compare SAir-IIoT with other IIoT-based testbeds, revealing its complexity and effectiveness to evaluate new cyber security methods.},

  abstract={Although the concept of digital twin technology has been in existence for nearly half a century, its application in healthcare is a relatively recent development. In healthcare, the utilization of digital twin and data-driven models has proven to enhance clinical decision support, particularly in the treatment and assessment of chronic wounds, leading to improved clinical outcomes. This article proposes the implementation of a digital twin in the domain of healthcare, specifically in the management of chronic wounds, by leveraging artificial intelligence techniques. The digital twin is composed of data collection, data processing, and AI models dedicated to wound healing. A novel AI pipeline is utilized to track the healing of chronic wounds. The digital twin, serving as a virtual representation of the actual wound, simulates and replicates the healing process. Furthermore, the proposed wound-healing prediction model effectively guides the treatment of chronic wounds. Additionally, by comparing the actual wound with its digital twin, the system enables early identification of non-healing wounds, facilitating timely adjustments and modifications to the treatment plan. By incorporating a digital twin in healthcare, the proposed system enables personalized and tailored treatments, potentially playing a crucial role in proactive problem identification.},

  abstract={Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves to optimize the physical systems. In this paper, we focus on studying efficient communication and computation scheme when constructing the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT)’s digital twin with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, the digital twin model is trained based on federated learning, in which all the unmanned surface vehicles deliver the trained models with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high altitude platform (HAP) for global model aggregation. Considering the potential eavesdropping on the radio signals of HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information before the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we aim to minimize the total energy consumption for constructing the digital twin of M-IoT by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, the local accuracy, the HAP’s transmission power and NOMA transmission duration, subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. An effective low-complexity algorithm is proposed to tackle this joint optimization problem with the use of a layered feature. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the performance gain of the proposed scheme, in comparison with the fixed accuracy scheme, the non-spread spectrum scheme and the time division multiple access transmission scheme.},

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based vehicular digital twin architecture for distributed collaborative computing. In this architecture, blockchain facilitates the opening and sharing of vehicular resources, while digital twin enables the accurate management decision.

  abstract={With the emergence of industry 4.0, the oil and gas (O&G) industry is now considering a range of digital technologies to enhance productivity, efficiency, and safety of their operations while minimizing capital and operating costs, health and environment risks, and variability in the O&G project life cycles. The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.},

  abstract={The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.},

  abstract={Operators of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) need to maintain awareness of the cyber situation in order to be able to adequately address potential issues in a timely manner. For instance, detecting early symptoms of cyber attacks may speed up the incident response process and mitigate consequences of attacks (e.g., business interruption, safety hazards). However, attaining a full understanding of the cyber situation may be challenging, given the complexity of CPSs and the ever-changing threat landscape. In particular, CPSs typically need to be continuously operational, may be sensitive to active scanning, and often provide only limited in-depth analysis capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the concept of digital twins for enhancing cyber situational awareness. Digital twins, i.e., virtual replicas of systems, can run in parallel to their physical counterparts and allow deep inspection of their behavior without the risk of disrupting operational technology services. This paper reports our work in progress to develop a cyber situational awareness framework based on digital twins that provides a profound, holistic, and current view on the cyber situation that CPSs are in. More specifically, we present a prototype that provides real-time visualization features (i.e., system topology, program variables of devices) and enables a thorough, repeatable investigation process on a logic and network level. A brief explanation of technological use cases and outlook on future development efforts completes this work.},

  abstract={Counterfeiting is a major problem in many industries, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damages every year. Digital twins further increase a product's value, making it critical to secure the link between the physical and digital world. An entire industry has sprung up to address this problem with a wide variety of product-authentication technologies, or crypto anchors, offering many different trade-offs between supported product surface, security level, price sensitivity, ease of use, etc. Each crypto-anchor vendor provides their own APIs for commissioning, verification and monitoring which makes it hard for application developers to support many of them. This paper introduces a platform that provides a generic model of an object secured by a crypto anchor, supporting any number of product authentication technologies by means of crypto-anchor plugins. Applications programmed against this generic model can immediately interoperate with any of the plugged-in crypto anchors. We present a blockchain architecture for the platform whose decentralization matches the highly differentiated industry structure. We've implemented the system on Hyperledger Fabric.},

Research projects are required not only to manage data efficiently but also to keep it safe to ensure that it can be later correctly interpreted and reused. The Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document that describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected, processed and/or generated during the project workflow. The DMP is not a fixed but rather a living document that will evolve through the lifespan of the project. A general idea of the paper is to give a brief description of the data (including any existing data, data taken from third-party sources or produced data) that is used during the project lifetime. Special attention is paid on how the data is created and collected, how the data is organized during the project (naming conventions, version control, and folder structures).

  abstract={Metaverse describes a new shape of cyberspace and has become a hot-trending word since 2021. There are many explanations about what Meterverse is and attempts to provide a formal standard or definition of Metaverse. However, these definitions could hardly reach universal acceptance. Rather than providing a formal definition of the Metaverse, we list four must-have characteristics of the Metaverse: socialization, immersive interaction, real world-building, and expandability. These characteristics not only carve the Metaverse into a novel and fantastic digital world, but also make it suffer from all security/privacy risks, such as personal information leakage, eavesdropping, unauthorized access, phishing, data injection, broken authentication, insecure design, and more. This paper first introduces the four characteristics, then the current progress and typical applications of the Metaverse are surveyed and categorized into four economic sectors. Based on the four characteristics and the findings of the current progress, the security and privacy issues in the Metaverse are investigated. We then identify and discuss more potential critical security and privacy issues that can be caused by combining the four characteristics. Lastly, the paper also raises some other concerns regarding society and humanity.},

The sixth-generation (6G) mobile network can use Digital-twin (DT) techniques to meet these demands. DT is the virtual representation of physical aspects such as 6G edge nodes. DT optimize the 6G edge nodes parameters using artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, AI and ML bring along privacy and security concerns. Therefore, user data must be protected from unauthorized persons during the 6G edge network recovery and expansion phases. In this paper, we proposed a new reliable Digital Twin-based 6G edge network recovery framework using Blockchain technology. We applied the Transfer Learning (TL) technique to improve our proposed framework’s performance. We ensured data privacy and security using TL and Blockchain.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) technology is being applied increasingly in the Internet of Vehicles environment, but it still faces many challenges in terms of efficiency and security. In the field of DT-based autonomous driving, many previous works have been done to study the efficient migration methods of DT models. But these works consider the migration process as a blackbox. We study the efficient migration method of the DT model between the edge computing nodes inside the blackbox. We propose three different migration strategies depending on the source of the initial data and the source of the updated data, and evaluate the efficiency of these strategies in terms of migration time in different network environments using the autonomous driving simulation platform CARLA. We then derive methods for selecting migration strategies under different network conditions. During the migration process, there may be external attacks on participating elements or networks. We analyze the security problems that may arise during the migration process and propose corresponding defense methods against such cyberattacks.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming a prevalent part of our society offering operational flexibility and convenience. However, insecure provisioning makes the IoT devices susceptible to various cyberattacks. For instance, mal-provisioned devices may leak sensitive information allowing the attackers to eavesdrop or disrupt communication infrastructures. Furthermore, compromised devices can act as zombies to intensify the scale of the attack. Hence, we need secure device provisioning services which can counteract such attacks and adverse circumstances. This article proposes a secure smart device provisioning and monitoring service architecture (SDPM) for smart network infrastructures, such as IoT-enabled smart home or office and Industrial IoT infrastructures. Our architecture allows the provisioning of devices in such a way that the malicious devices can be controlled and their activities using a dynamic policy-based approach. SDPM introduces an IoT device ontology for device registration and authentication and uses the ontology to construct device category and service-specific policies. SDPM provides a fine granular pre and post condition-based policies to provision securely the IoT devices and control their runtime operations. Furthermore, SDPM utilizes the digital twin concept, to monitor dynamically the security status of IoT devices at runtime. The policies associated with a device’s twin enables the SDPM to automate security capabilities, such as device firmware updating and patching for security vulnerabilities.},

We use attack graph to generate the attacker’s strategy and find the optimal honeypot deployment strategy in a constant confrontation. We develop a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to train the attack strategy and the honeypot deployment strategy. To cope with the large strategy space problem, we modify the neural network structure for the attacker and the defender according to the deception game rules. We conduct experiments with real network data and various game settings to evaluate the performance of our approach. Experiment results show that our RL-based approach outperforms baselines, and the approach is robust to the uncertain security environment.},

  abstract={Metaverse has been gaining the attention of industry and academia equally in the recent past. With the immense capabilities backed by cutting-edge technologies, it has the potential to revolutionize every domain, especially healthcare. Metaverse can help to give customized treatment by a specialist to a patient anywhere in the world. However, akin to any new technology, the adoption of a metaverse in healthcare is susceptible to security issues and vulnerabilities. A proper study of the weakness and potential vulnerabilities is required before the active integration of metaverse into healthcare. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the existing applications of the metaverse and its enabling technologies in the healthcare domain and investigate the security issues that exist or are likely to arise. Through the literature analysis, we identified three essential metaverse components for future healthcare systems, namely, Extended Reality (XR), Blockchain, and Avatar. These components and their combinations in varying degrees will give different dimensions to metaverse-based healthcare solutions. Further, we analyzed the risks associated with these components and their combinations. Here, the overall risk assessment was based on the existing literature and vulnerabilities, new cyber attacks, and the current trend of cyber attacks in the healthcare domain. The vulnerabilities collected from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) site were used for studying the risks associated with metaverse, healthcare and their integration.},

  abstract={In recent years, industrial control systems have evolved toward stability and efficiency, increasing industrial control systems interconnected with the Internet, which means that industrial control systems are facing more serious cyber threats. Thus, it is critical for enterprises to consider issues related to data privacy and network security. Digital twin enables real-time synchronization and simulation of data from various physical components of industrial control systems. However, anomaly detection of twin data is still challenging because existing methods are usually multi-stage with tedious training and detection steps. Therefore, we propose a method called end-to-end anomaly detection with the aim to accomplish real-time anomaly detection quickly and accurately. In order to seek key features, multidimensional deconvolutional network and attention mechanism are applied to our model. The results of this study indicate that our method performs well on precision and F1 score in comparison to the state-of-art methods.},

  abstract={The employment of digital technologies is essential for creating new comfort levels, security, smartness, and efficiency in buildings.

To capitalize on the benefits of building sector digitization and respond to rising demands for energy efficiency, comfort, and safety, we propose merging historical, real-world, and forecast data into a context information model to characterize and better comprehend the building. This is accomplished by digitally representing real-world assets as Digital Twins, enabling for integrated data-driven decision making across the building life cycle. The proposed holistic Digital Twin platform ‘Twin4Build’ substitutes the conventional static Building Information Model with a living deployable model that combines dynamic energy models and real-time data to provide a variety of operational services such as gathering and handling data, real-time performance monitoring and analysis, continuous commissioning, and strategic planning.},

In contrast to the current automation systems, the future automation systems in context of Industry 4.0 offer high interconnectedness but require a security solution. The interaction deals with retrieving and processing data from the process control system and sending feedback to it. For retrieving data from automation systems different concepts are discussed such as the NAMUR Information diode.

In this article, we propose an incentive-based federated learning scheme for digital twin (DT)-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, we first design a DT-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing architecture to achieve dynamic perception of the complex IIoT environment, among heterogeneous and resource-constrained mobile clients. Second, we develop a novel incentive-based federated learning framework incorporated with a contract-based reputation mechanism and a Stackelberg-based interclient incentive mechanism, to optimize the model accuracy. Third, we devise a knowledge distillation algorithm for the federated learning framework, to address the heterogeneity of nonindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Extensive experiments on both MNIST/FEMNIST and CIFAR10/100 data sets demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed scheme, in terms of model accuracy, incentive fairness, and data compatibility, compared to state-of-the-art studies.},

As an evolving paradigm of next-generation Internet, metaverse, a fully immersive, hyper spatiotemporal and selfsustaining virtual shared space, is moving from imagination to the coming reality. However, its massive data flow, pervasive user profiling activities and other intrinsic features can lead to a lot of security and privacy concerns, which will hinder its further deployment. Specially, since the identities of users/avatars in the metaverse can be illegally stolen, impersonated, and interoperability issues can be encountered in authentication across metaverses, this paper designs a lightweight and privacy-preserving seamless cross-metaverse authentication and key agreement scheme named MetaverseAKA to meet the challenges. Metaverse-AKA can not only realize the seamless cross-metaverse authentication but also assure the users’ privacy by achieving the anonymity and unlinkability. In addition, Metaverse-AKA also has the following advantages: (i) Realizing the traceability for users in physical world. (ii) Resistance to multiple attacks like impersonation attack, man-in-the-middle attack and replay attack.

In this work, a self-security method is developed and implemented using the digital twin concept for smart inverters. This paper shows a digital twin can be formed using the dynamic model for grid-interactive inverters. In the proposed self-security method, the incoming setpoints are autonomously examined using the digital twin, and only the safe setpoints are engaged to the inverter’s local controller. This paper demonstrates the details of the self-security algorithm and how the inverter’s digital twin is formed. In particular, an inverter's stable and unstable operation is experimentally verified by changing the power setpoints engaged to the local controller, using a laboratory setup including a three-phase 5-kVA SiC-MOSFET inverter. The results demonstrate that the digital twin model can potentially protect inverters from an abnormal operation, i.e., instability, by examining the incoming new setpoints before engaging the setpoints to the local controller.},

  abstract={Critical infrastructures and industrial facilities are examples of Cyber-Physical Systems, which are sophisticated systems that integrate physical processes and communication networks. Regrettably, the combination of physical and cyber layers raises the possibility of complications such as a larger surface area for cyberattacks. Due to the unique characteristics of the industrial environment, applying safeguarding architecture similar to that created for the IT sector is not conceivable. Yet, in this study, we exploit the features of industrial communication networks to design the Smart Security Probe, an intrusion detection system for industrial networks. This solution was created to detect potential anomalies in network traffic and to assist in inferring potential anomalies in data connected to physical processes. Smart Security Probe has two operating modes: passive and interactive. When the passive mode is selected, the proposed device analyses the traffic shape in a transparent way, while in the interactive mode it is possible to send packets to allow further analysis and the device is visible in the network. When the interactive mode is activated, a model-based anomaly detection system is included in the suggested approach. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol, the Smart Security Probe can communicate with a remote station to implement an asynchronous Extended Kalman Filter. Smart Security Probe was tested and validated in a system comprised of one Programmable Logic Controller and one Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system that controls three simulated interconnected tanks.},

From the perspective of operation, after the distributed generation is related to the electric distribution grid, due to the uncertainty of wind energy, solar energy and other new energy, there will be higher harmonics in the distribution network that affect the power quality and power supply reliability. On the other hand, it is necessary to consider the economic cost and reasonably distribute the output status of different units in the distribution network to achieve the unity of economic and ecological benefits. While, it has occasion to research the dispatching method of electric distribution grid with distributed generation. This paper uses digital twinning technology to build virtual equipment modeling scheme, which integrates equipment basic data, system single line diagram and grid geographic coordinate data.

Furthermore, recent research works are starting to study the integration of digital twins for computer networks to allow more innovation and intelligent management. One of the basic building blocks of digital twins technology is the Internet of Things where wireless sensors and actuators are deployed to ensure the interaction between the physical and digital worlds. This type of network is complex to manage due to its severe constraints especially when it controls critical industrial applications, resulting in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). We believe that the optimization of the IIoT will lead to efficient integration of Digital Twins in Industry 4.0. In this paper, we design a Network Digital Twin for the IIoT where sensors, actuators and communication infrastructure are replicated in the digital twin to enable intelligent real-time management of such networks. This way, new networking services such as predictive maintenance, network diagnosis, resource allocation, energy optimization with other intelligent services can be efficiently integrated and exploited in the network life-cycle. We validate the proposed architecture by providing a promising prototype implementation that should unleash the full potential of the network digital twin.},

  abstract={The 6G wireless network is expected to drive cyber-physical systems (CPS) from merely connected things to securely connected intelligence. While 6G will offer real-time communication between cyber and physical entities, due to convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) networks, security, and trustworthiness of the massive amount of data shared between cyber and physical entities will remain of great concern. Attackers having AI capability will be able to mount massive numbers of automated and novel attacks on the future 6G network. Human security specialists teaming with an AI-powered adaptive defense mechanism will be needed to counter emerging AI-based attacks on the massively connected CPS through 6G wireless networks. 6G networks are expected to add industrial immunity to IT, OT, and IIoT networks with the help of AI. 6G is expected to offer deep learning (DL) assisted security function virtualization (SFV) to support software defined security (SDS) architecture for dynamic defense mechanisms, intelligently monitor network traffic anomalies at different network endpoints and segments, and offer increased visibility across attack surfaces. In this article, we study the security challenges in 6G networks posed by the recent convergence of OT and IT networks and propose distributed DL-assisted SDS for 6G vertical that will autonomously detect, localize, and isolate security threats via SFV. Finally, we present future directions and the challenges ahead.},

  pages={1253-1258},
  abstract={Federated edge learning can be essential in supporting privacy-preserving, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled activities in digital twin 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, we need to also consider the potential of attacks targeting the underlying AI systems (e.g., adversaries seek to corrupt data on the IoT devices during local updates or corrupt the model updates); hence, in this article, we propose an anticipatory study for poisoning attacks in federated edge learning for digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. Specifically, we study the influence of adversaries on the training and development of federated learning models in digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. We demonstrate that attackers can carry out poisoning attacks in two different learning settings, namely: centralized learning and federated learning, and successful attacks can severely reduce the model's accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications with three deep neural networks under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and the independent and identically distributed (IID) data. The poisoning attacks, on an attack classification problem, can lead to a decrease in accuracy from 94.93% to 85.98% with IID data and from 94.18% to 30.04% with Non-IID.},

  abstract={This paper lays out a framework for using modeling and simulation to build a “soft digital twin” (SDT) and demonstrates its efficacy by modeling the maintenance task processes within a real-world mission-critical facility. Such crucial infrastructure systems, such as nuclear power plants, rely on the efficient completion of maintenance tasks (MTs) to achieve high reliability with minimal downtime. Managers often wish for a “crystal ball” that can enable them to configure their resources optimally. However, the MTs are inevitably encountered by various uncertainties rooted in intrinsic equipment failures, endogenous factors (e.g., staffing), and exogenous factors (e.g., supply chain disruptions). Thus, it is challenging to manage these tasks. The proposed SDT can serve as a “crystal ball” to gain insights into resource configurations, staff planning, and task scheduling, thanks to the versatility of simulation. This feasibility study uses both a data-driven framework and stochastic modeling methods to construct the SDT. Initial results indicate the SDT can produce reliable results comparable to the test dataset retrospectively, and it can be used to minimize the time in system of the MTs, while maximizing the throughput within a specific time frame.},

  pages={2359-2367},
  abstract={The purposes are to explore the safety performance of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) based on Digital Twins (DTs) Internet of Things (IoT) and develop maritime transportation towards intelligence and digitalization. Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.},

  pages={80863-80873},
  abstract={Critical infrastructures are designed for securing interconnecting networks from different influencing factors such as adversaries, unauthorized platoons, cyber threats, etc. These infrastructure hosts include human, physical elements, and cyber paradigms. The vital part is cyber resilience against weak and volatile authentication and security administrations. For strengthening cyber security, this article introduces the Artificial Intelligence-induced Constructive Resilience Model (AI-CRM). The proposed model accounts for the security requirements of the adversary impacting infrastructure elements based on probability. This probability is computed using previous adversary impacts on infrastructure failures and session drops in handling operational services. The computation for linearity or stagnancy is validated using a recurrent learning paradigm over different service transitions. The resilience is improved by augmenting security measures that are identified as an output of linear impacts over the services. Based on the linear incremental probability the resilience between two successive service transitions is computed. Identifying the non-linear or stagnant probability is the converging solution of recurrent learning. The recurrent learning optimizes the stagnancy and linear impact (probability) by repeatedly computing the failures and drops due to adversary injection. This improves resilience through security augmentations and modifications. This model is analyzed using adversary detection ratio, session drops, infrastructure failures, time lag, and service dissemination ratio.},

  pages={21479-21488},
  abstract={This work aims to analyze malicious communication behaviors that pose a threat to the security of digital twins (DTs) and safeguard user privacy. A unified and integrated multidimensional DTs Network (DTN) architecture is constructed. On this basis, the propagation process model of malware in the network is built to analyze the malicious propagation behavior that threatens network security. This model ensures the protection of mobile distributed machine learning system security. Blockchain technology is a distributed data protection mechanism with broad prospects. It is characterized by decentralization, transparency, and anonymity, which can help ensure secure network data sharing and privacy protection. Based on this, this work designs a secure distributed data sharing (DDS) architecture based on blockchain to improve the security and reliability of data protection with the support of the Internet of Things (IoT). Then, digital resource allocation based on semi-distributed learning is examined to propose a broad learning federated continuous learning (BL-FCL) algorithm combining blockchain and DTs. This algorithm significantly speeds up the model training process. Broad learning technology supports incremental learning. In this way, each client does not need to retrain when learning the newly generated data. In the experimental part, the prediction accuracy of BL-FCL on the mixed national institute of standards and technology data set is similar to that of the FedAvg-50 and FedAvg-80 schemes. As the number of devices increases from 1 to 6, the detection probability exhibits a rapid decrease. However, as the number of devices further increases from 6 to 10, the detection probability gradually decreases at a slower rate until it reaches 0. Comparatively, the prediction accuracy of the BL-FCL outperforms the federated averaging algorithm-based scheme by 20%–60%. The BL-FCL reported here can deal with the problem of inaccurate training while ensuring the privacy and security of users. This work is of great significance for ensuring the security of the DTN and promoting the development of the digital economy. The results can provide references for applying blockchain and distributed learning in the DT field.},

  abstract={In recent years, human society has been witnessed to evolve fast to the era of big data, rendering the data sharing and privacy protection a key issue for the development of digital economies. Federated learning, as a novel pattern for distributed machine learning, is aimed to train a centralized model from decentralized datasets while protecting user privacy, and is now intensively studied in literature. However, a variety of technical challenges, e.g., security issues, incentive mechanism design, are still awaiting further research efforts. In this respect, blockchain proves to be an elegant solution for federated learning to overcome these issues, and thus has been applied in federated learning in many scenarios with success. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey for blockchain-enabled federated learning, proposed its technical framework and discussed the key research issues. This work represents the first attempt for reviewing the literature aiming at integrating blockchain and federated learning, and can be expected to offer useful guidance for establishing a new infrastructure for decentralized and secured data circulation, as well as promoting the development of related industries.},

  abstract={The increasing use of distributed renewable energy sources and storage devices in the power grid has introduced new challenges related to the stability and reliability of the system. In response to these challenges, virtual power plants (VPPs) have emerged as a promising solution for integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) and improving power system performance. However, conventional VPPs have a number of limitations, such as the lack of real-time simulation capabilities, state of health monitoring, predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, security and resiliency assessment. This paper proposes the application of digital twins (DTs) to address these limitations and improve VPP performance for prosumer dominated grid, focusing on dynamic state estimation, real-time control and optimization. The research reviews state-of-the-art studies that have applied the DT concept to power system applications, particularly microgrids, and presents a novel DT model for real-time orchestration in power electronics-dominated grids. The DT model utilizes available information regarding transmission lines, loads, and power electronic devices, along with measurement data.},

  abstract={The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network.},

  abstract={Ensuring reliable update and evolution of a virtual twin in human digital twin (HDT) systems depends on any connectivity scheme implemented between such a virtual twin and its physical counterpart. The adopted connectivity scheme must consider HDT-specific requirements including privacy, security, accuracy and the overall connectivity cost. This paper presents a new, secure, privacy-preserving and efficient human-to-virtual twin connectivity scheme for HDT by integrating three key techniques: differential privacy, federated multi-task learning and blockchain. Specifically, we adopt federated multi-task learning, a personalized learning method capable of providing higher accuracy, to capture the impact of heterogeneous environments. Next, we propose a new validation process based on the quality of trained models during the federated multi-task learning process to guarantee accurate and authorized model evolution in the virtual environment. The proposed framework accelerates the learning process without sacrificing accuracy, privacy and communication costs which, we believe, are non-negotiable requirements of HDT networks. Finally, we compare the proposed connectivity scheme with related solutions and show that the proposed scheme can enhance security, privacy and accuracy while reducing the overall connectivity cost.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things or Industry 4.0 efficiently enhances the manufacturing process in terms of raising productivity, system performance, cost reduction, and building large-scale systems. It enables the connection of numerous heterogeneous devices and sensors into the internet network through the utilization of revolutionary techniques that transfer the manufacturing paradigm to intelligent processes. The traditional industrial internet of things adopts centralized architectures and complex encryption algorithms that suffer from several cyber-security threats and lead to data leakage, privacy disclosure, and high computational and communicational costs. In our work, we proposed a decentralized, efficient, low-power, scalable, secure, privacy-preserving, and trusting architecture based on a private blockchain network/smart contract and interplanetary file system technology for the Al-NajafyIraq oil refinery factory. That enables autonomous working and provides a high level of security authentication and privacy preservation, P2P communication, remote access, immutability and information backtracking. Traditional blockchain technology has storage limitation issues, most recent works adopted external servers or the cloud for storage purposes. Our proposed scheme addresses the limitations of blockchain data storage by adopting an interplanetary file system (IPFS) network; provides an efficient data encryption mechanism at the perceptual layer by adopting a lightweight encryption algorithm, high-performance, and ultra-low-power consumption ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. In addition, our architecture succeeds in merging blockchain technology, IoTs, and an IPFS with the oil refinery as an industrial application area. Moreover, it provides an efficient framework that resists common cyber-security attacks and realizes cyber-security requirements represented by data availability, integrity, and confidentiality.},

  abstract={With the continuous integration of information technology and operation technology, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gradually changing from closed to open. Operators can configure, monitor, or control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber-attacks. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a framework for a digital twin-based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.},
