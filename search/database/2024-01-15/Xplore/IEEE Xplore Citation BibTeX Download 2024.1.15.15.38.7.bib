  abstract={As the growing proportion of aging population, the demand for sustainable, high quality, and timely healthcare services has become increasingly pressing, especially since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in the early of 2020. To meet this demand, a promising strategy is to introduce cloud computing and digital twin techniques into the healthcare systems, where the cloud server is employed for storing healthcare data and offering efficient query services, and the digital twin is used for building digital representation for patients and leverages the query services of the cloud server to monitor healthcare states of patients. Although several cloud computing and digital twin based healthcare monitoring frameworks have been proposed, none of them has considered the data privacy issue, yet the leakage of the private healthcare information may cause catastrophic losses to patients. Aiming at the challenge, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving similarity query based healthcare monitoring scheme over digital twin cloud platform, named PSim-DTH. Specifically, we first formalize a similarity query based healthcare monitoring model over digital twin cloud platform. Then, we deploy a partition-based tree (PB-tree) to index the healthcare data and introduce matrix encryption to propose a privacy-preserving PB-tree based similarity range query (PSRQ) algorithm. Based on PSRQ algorithm, we propose our PSim-DTH scheme. Both security analysis and performance evaluation are extensively conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed PSim-DTH scheme is really privacy-preserving and efficient.},

  pages={29-36},
  abstract={The great progress in the field of digitization and networking of the industry brings many advantages as well as new challenges. On the one hand, it enables new business models that hold great economic growth potential. On the other hand, it leads to an increased heterogeneity of the resulting value- added networks. This poses a striking problem when it comes to the interconnection of industrial devices and the establishment of new business models. Since the disadvantages can quickly outweigh the advantages, activities in this area proceed still very cautiously. A solution is offered by highly dynamic attribute-based usage control architectures at network-level, which monitor the entire communication in the value-added networks. Previous approaches, however, either have the disadvantage that they can only use communication metadata as attributes, or are highly specialized and tailored to the respective systems of the individual network nodes. In addition, they are usually pure access control systems instead of usage control systems. In this paper, the authors propose a novel attribute-based usage control model (ABUC) that allows simulation models in form of digital twins of the respective network components to be used in order to predict their behavior and thus control network traffic according to predicted usage. The ABUC model is then implemented in a use case and validated with several performance tests.},

  abstract={With the recent advancements in industry 4.0 new concepts like “Digital Twin” has been rising also for the gastronomy sector. Gastronomic processes like cooking, serving, presenting, and preparing food have evolved with the new trends utilizing Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). This paper presents an innovative concept of digital cloning of gastronomic devices, named as eGastronomic things, to monitor their functions and simulate their operations. Here, eGastronomic things have both real physical appearances and their digital counterparts presenting them as a living 3D model augmented with its real incorporating data. Such live data can be any sensory or instant data observed while the device is working, or any catalogue data, like the model name and the owner information, stored in a database. In order to prove the concept, a case study where the digital twin of an industrial ice cream machine (as an example of an eGastronomic thing) is presented. The ice cream machine and its 3D digital twin can be visualized in a 3D virtual environment which enables interaction through AR or VR. The digital twin of the machine is secured with an electronic IoT gateway embedded in the machine and incorporated with a data acquisition board. Thus, the device is protected against unauthenticated use by realizing a secure access control mechanism.},

  abstract={The intelligence and integrity of a real-time cyber–physical system depend on how trustworthy the data’s legitimacy, appropriation, and authorization are during end-to-end communication between the participating nodes in its network. With the recurrent repugnant global violations of the airspace by drones and their derivatives, there is an urgent need to empirically evaluate the underlying security architectures that govern drone usage operations for priority logistics. This review examines the significant contribution of artificial intelligence models and blockchain to the development of trustworthy and reliable intelligent and secure autonomous systems by integrating cyberspace, intelligence space, and airspace security. PRISMA-SPIDER methodology was adopted for the systematic review of 133 articles based on the inclusion criteria consisting of 91 (68.4%) quantitative studies, 19 qualitative studies (14.2%), and 23 (17.3%) mixed method studies to balance article selection sensitivity and specificity. The review outcome shows a significant disconnect between model proposals and actual implementation. Through the incorporation of zero-trust architecture into the existing blockchain technology and the convergence of newer AI models, dynamic security issues like drone ownership authentication, drone package delivery verification, drone operation authorization, and drone jurisdiction accountability, can be achieved seamlessly for secure smart mobility via drone transportation systems.},

  abstract={Resilient management of the built environment is a strategic objective, made even more evident by recent events, not only in terms of managing chronic stresses such as social, economic and financial stresses, but especially emergency situations. Human settlements can be considered complex systems and when disaster strikes, the degree of complexity is amplified exponentially. Thus, traditional management systems, based on classical paradigms, may be completely ineffective. Therefore, new management approaches are needed to implement safety, resilience and sustainability. In this context, this paper illustrates a research where Digital Twin (DT) is exploited as an adaptive system for the built environment, as a support to optimize post-disaster reconstruction processes with a focus on reactive security management, in order to implement resilience in a smart city perspective. Following this vision, the research project aims to realise a first extended framework enabling the implementation of digital twins in the built environment, then defining some DT demonstrators in the laboratory.},

  abstract={Digital twin for connected vehicles is a key enabling technology to accelerate the full digitization of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In a well-designed wireless environment such as 6G network, an accurate digital twin model for connected vehicles will significantly strengthen the efficiency, reliability and security of ITS. For a vehicle system, there are many potential practical factors that affect the accuracy of its digital twin model, including air resistance, tire rolling resistance, carrying loads, transmission shafts, controller and engine performance, etc. To create a realistic digital representation of the vehicle system, this paper elaborately integrates the powertrain and longitudinal dynamics into the digital twin model for car-following scenarios. The Measure-of-Performances (MoPs) and Goodness-of-Fit functions (GoFs) are exploited for model parameter fitting and fitting error measurement, respectively, using real trajectory dataset. The analytical and experimental results indicate that the accuracy of digital twin model increases 13.28%, 14.51% and 12.80% than that of the conventional Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) under the GoFs of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE_tilde) and Theil’s Inequality Coefficient U-function, respectively.},

  pages={420-425},
  abstract={Providing Internet access above-the-clouds has made the development of aircraft networks more important than ever. However, new and emerging Internet applications have increased the challenge of providing seamless and real-time connectivity with traditional routing algorithms for aircraft networks in the upcoming 6G due to the highly-dynamic and unstable topology. Moreover, traditional routing mechanisms are prone to routing attacks, which can increase the packet transfer delay. To this end, in this paper, we present Merkle Tree-based secure routing mechanism with the assistance of digital twin. First, we construct a blockchain-based system with decentralized and distributed characteristics for the clustering of aircraft. Then, we propose a novel Merkle-Tree-based secure routing algorithm by combining real-time and historical data with digital twins. A Merkle tree is a data structure that contains gathered data from sender and receiver aircraft. Merkle root in an aircraft cluster forwards the gathered data to a satellite or a ground station in a secure manner. Accordingly, Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)-256 is used for data integrity and a tree-based structure is built to reduce the number of transactions so that it is aimed to prevent malicious aircraft attacks. Finally, we show through a simulation environment, how blockchain processing time and the number of transactions can be reduced by meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for aircraft networks in 6G. Furthermore, we also use Proof of Stake (PoS) to reduce the computational time for mining a block as well as reducing the packet delivery ratio and packet transfer delay.},

  abstract={To meet the stringent service requirements of 6G applications such as immersive cloud eXtended Reality (XR), holographic communication, and digital twin, there is no doubt that an increasing number of servers will be deployed on the network edge. Then, the techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence will be more widely utilized for intelligent local data storage and processing generated by 6G applications, while innovative access network architecture based on the cloud-edge servers, such as the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) will be adopted to improve the flexibility and openness for new service deployment and frequent network changes. On the other hand, new attack surfaces and vectors targeting local infrastructure and users will emerge along with the deployment of novel network architecture and techniques. Massive researchers have studied the potential security and privacy threats on the 6G network edge as well as the countermeasures. The three techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence have become a double-edged sword that can not only be synchronously utilized to develop defense countermeasures, but also become the targets of many new security and privacy threats. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of articles on the three techniques-related security threats and countermeasures on the 6G network edge. We explain how security and privacy can be destroyed by attacking one of the three technologies and how the three services support each other to realize efficient and achievable security protection. Moreover, the researches on the benefits and limitations of Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain for decentralized edge network systems in terms of security and privacy are also investigated. Additionally, we also analyze the existing challenges and future directions towards 6G.},

Furthermore, a digital twin-enabled IoT network may generate a vast amount of data, posing storage, processing, and security difficulties. In this study, we presented a blockchain and software-defined networking (SDN) integrated framework for offering decentralized and secure data operations in IoT networks to address these concerns. To filter malicious packets, the proposed system incorporates a packet analyzer and feature extraction modules at the SDN control layer. The blockchain is then constructed using an elliptic curve point technique for authenticating IoT devices. The results reveal that, when compared to the existing model, our suggested approach performs significantly better in terms of latency and throughput.},

  abstract={The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.},

Agile Security models different types of security requirements into the context of an attack graph, containing business process targets and critical assets identification, configuration items, and possible impacts of cyber-attacks. By simulating and analyzing virtual adversary attack paths toward cardinal assets, Agile Security examines the business impact on business processes and prioritizes surgical requirements. Thus, handling these requirements backlog that are constantly evaluated as an outcome of employing Agile Security, gradually increases system hardening, reduces business risks and informs the IT service desk or Security Operation Center what remediation action to perform next. Once remediated, Agile Security constantly recomputes residual risk, assessing risk increase by threat intelligence or infrastructure changes versus defender's remediation actions in order to drive overall attack surface reduction.},

  abstract={There is no doubt that transformer plays a fundamental role in power system. At the same time, transformer winding fault diagnosis is an important topic. Many works put the most emphasis on the identification of fault type and degree, while ignoring the fault location. However, fault location is an urgent problem to be solved, which is worth studying and discussing. The contribution of this paper lies in the location of Disk space variation (DSV) fault The introduction of digital twin can solve the problem of insufficient fault cases, and pave the way for the intellectualization of fault diagnosis. In this paper, the digital twin of transformer winding is established based on double ladder network, in which the distributed parameters are calculated by finite element method. Frequency response analysis (FRA) is one of the most widely accepted methods for transformer winding mechanical deformation fault diagnosis. By extracting the mathematical index of FRA, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is trained and DSV fault location is realized. In addition, the popular support vector machine is also compared with the MLP model in this paper, which further highlights the advantages of MLP. The proposed method is verified by an actual transformer, and the results are satisfactory.},

  abstract={Modern Intelligent Infrastructures (II) are highly complex, interconnected systems that are now emerging. For instance, II can integrate technologies and processes to provide citizens with faster services and better goods. An average II can include many technologies, e.g., Cloud applications and IoT devices, under different environments, e.g., industry 4.0 production plants and smart buildings. Although II bring concrete benefits to all of these contexts, they also carry security concerns. Reasoning about threats and security exposures that might affect II is non-trivial. This is only partially due to their inherent complexity. As a matter of fact, real II are typically in charge of some critical operations that cannot be interrupted or compromised for experimental purposes. An alternative solution is to rely on digital replicas which can provide a good trade-off between realism and usability. These assets represent a strategic and highly demanded resource for the security community. In this paper, we present HArMoNICS, a case study infrastructure meant to provide a playground for security experts interested in II security. HArMoNICS revolves around a digital replica of a real Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM) located in Italy. Although most of the components are based on or inspired by the real system, HArMoNICS has been enriched with further security-relevant features. As a result, the case study includes vertical use cases focusing on specific security topics. Security researchers can use it to assess the effectiveness of new methodologies, to carry out security training activities, or even to extend it with new elements.},

  abstract={The exponential growth of the Internet of Things in recent years has created an ever larger cyber attack surface, introducing new security vulnerabilities for all computerized systems. Among the most significant of those systems are industrial control systems (ICS) consisting of many cyber physical components, and smart grids are a prominent example of ICS, whose failures have potential to cause major disruptions in all aspects of our daily lives. In this paper, we provide an overview of smart grid cybersecurity standards, and review major threats to smart grid environments at the physical, network and application layers. In order to overcome the current lack of standards for security evaluation of smart grids, we propose a digital twins based approach for the complete life cycle of a smart grid, which accurately models the functioning of the physical grid and avoids service disruptions caused by running security tests on the actual grid. A digital twins based approach is promising to provide a common ground for the development of standardized models for continuous and comprehensive penetration testing of smart grids.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 concept is associated with introducing the new digital technologies to increase the competitiveness of an industrial enterprise or of an industry sector where it is being implemented. One of the important technologies improving the competitiveness are those used for diagnostics before and after a failure occurs - predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis. These enable to increase reliability of the equipment by efficiently planning and scheduling service and this way reducing or even eliminating the downtime at minimal service costs. For this purposes the advanced simulation techniques - Digital twin technologies along with Cloud services and Big data processing are increasingly implemented. The paper focuses on introducing these technologies into the educational process of the electrical engineers. The demand on industry digitalization and the rapid developments of digital technologies require the academia to keep up and introduce the basics of the technologies into the training process of the future electrical engineers. In modern world the competitiveness of the national industry as well as the engineers themselves is based on the interdisciplinary competences in the sphere of electrical engineering and the emerging digital technologies.},

  abstract={Nowadays, electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly being embraced as a primary mode of transportation. However, the issue of efficient and secure charging remains a major barrier to the widespread adoption of EVs. Drivers may have to spend a lot of time and effort finding suitable charging stations. As a virtual agent for EVs in cyberspace, a digital twin can monitor and analyze the EV’s operation and battery status from physical raw data, contact the charging management center to reserve charging stations in advance, and guide the EV there using decision feedback. While the digital twin can improve the charging experience and convenience for drivers, adversaries can launch attacks on the vulnerable channel resulting in receiving incorrect decisions for EV from the digital twin. In this paper, we will utilize an extended Chebyshev chaotic map to design a digital twin-assisted secure charging reservation scheme for EV that ensures secure data transmission and defends against potential attacks. Furthermore, we also provide informal security analysis and performance evaluation to demonstrate the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Mobile edge computing is one of the key enabling technologies of smart industry solutions, providing agile and ubiquitous services for mobile devices (MDs) through offloading latency-critical tasks to edge service providers. However, it is challenging to make optimal decisions of computation offloading and resource allocation while ensuring the privacy and information security of MDs. Consequently, we consider a new vision of digital twin (DT) empowered edge networks, where the optimization problem is formulated as a two-stage incentive mechanism. First, the resource allocation strategy is determined by the interaction among DTs according to the credit-based incentives. Afterward, a distributed incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg-based alternating direction method of multipliers is opted to obtain the optimal offloading and privacy investment strategies in parallel. Numerical results show that the proposed two-stage incentive mechanism achieves effective resource allocation and computation offloading while simultaneously improving the privacy and information security of MDs.},

  abstract={Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.},

This paper focuses on a service based interaction of MES and process control in a modular an interconnected environment to promote process optimization. Another important factor that must be considered is security. Linking the industrial automation with IT technologies is a basis for optimization and digitalization but it exposes the system to security threats. Retrieving process information for further data processing and online system optimization including the controlled process must be accomplished via an approach that ensures the security requirements of the system.

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing industry currently being integrated into both consumer and industrial environments on a wide scale. While the technology is available and deployment has a low barrier of entry in future applications, proper security frameworks are still at infancy stage and are being developed to fit varied implementations and device architectures. Further, the need for edge centric mechanisms are critical to offer security in real time smart connected applications with minimal or negligible overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of data security by using multiple device shadows (aka digital twins) for a single physical object. These twins are paramount to separate data among different virtual objects based on tags assigned on-the-fly, and are used to limit access to different data points by authorized users/applications only. The novelty of the proposed architecture resides in the attachment of dynamic tags to key-value pairs reported by physical devices in the system. We further examine the advantages of tagging data in a digital twin system, and the performance impacts of the proposed data separation scheme. The proposed solution is deployed at the edge, supporting low latency and real time security mechanisms with minimal overhead, and is light-weight as reflected by captured performance metrics.},

  abstract={Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360° camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360° live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360° web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.},

  abstract={New industrial paradigms, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 5.0, are emerging in industrial contexts with the aim of fostering quality in operational processes. With the expected launch of 6G in the coming years, IIoT networks in Industry 5.0 ecosystems can leverage 6G technology and its support for training machine learning models using Digital Twins (DTs), embedded in DT Networks (DTNs), to transparently and continuously optimize their communications. Unfortunately, the use of these technologies, in turn, intensifies the attack surface and poses a serious threat to the new goals of Industry 5.0, such as improving the user experience, sustainability and resilience. This article therefore proposes a layered protection framework for 6G-enabled IIoT environments, where not only DTs and DTNs are fully protected, but also the whole 6G ecosystem, complying with the expected goals of Industry 5.0. To achieve this, the framework identifies for each protection layer a set of security and privacy services to subsequently relate them to existing computing infrastructures (cloud, edge, edge-cloud) and provide the best approach for future IIoT deployments.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a cyber digital twin (CDT) for supporting the analysis of power system substation network security and validating solutions utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). This work focuses on targeted attacks against the Generic Object Oriented Sub-station Event (GOOSE) protocol. The developed CDT mirrors a realistic substation network consisting of a real-time digital simulator (RTDS), industry-graded hardware relays, merging units, SDN switches, and related communication networks. The CDT consists of a virtual network to which external devices can connect, an open-source SDN flow controller to specify network packet destination, OpenFlow protocol to configure packet flows, a custom-built GOOSE parser and builder, and an open-source library to facilitate GOOSE message exchange between external hosts. Two use cases of GOOSE spoofing attacks were conducted, which were successfully detected using novel feature engineering and a machine learning approach, yielding an accuracy of 95%, precision of 96%, and F-1 score of 96%. Finally, SDN was introduced as a potential solution to mitigate such GOOSE attacks from the bottom up. The overall study underlines the proposed CDT for substation network design's efficacy in improving overall network resilience against GOOSE integrity attacks, as well as its potential for developing and validating solutions for cyber attack defense and mitigation for real-world systems.},

  abstract={The paper considers the problem of the operation maintenance of complex soft- and hardware systems, for example, automated control systems of industrial objects, when individual components of the system become unavailable for replacement in case of their failure or for other reasons. When the replacement components differ from those that were designed at the system creation stage, the upgrade task arises. System upgrades require a complete cycle of work on validating both the replaceable components and the changed system itself. The system itself, if it is included in the life cycle of an existing industrial object, actually cannot be used as a testbed of the new components; generally, full-size system layouts are used for the testbed, and the complexity of those layouts may be comparable to the system itself. The inclusion of the digital twin in the life cycle of the object and its control system allows to effectively solve the problem of system modification (individual components replacement) in this case. The digital twin is not only a cheaper analog of the system that can be used for testing; due to the properties that allow parallel testing for several copies and to influence the model time within certain limits, it provides a higher quality of testing.},

At the same time, the differential privacy frequent subgraph (DPFS) is introduced to keep data privacy confidential, and the digital twins technology is used to map the operating environment of the drone in the physical space, and an attack prediction model for drone digital twins CPS is constructed based on differential privacy-improved LSTM. Finally, the tennessee eastman (TE) process is undertaken as a simulation platform to simulate the constructed model so as to verify its performance. In addition, the proposed model is compared with the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Attention-BiLSTM models proposed by other scholars. It was found that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed model is the smallest (0.20) when the number of hidden layer nodes is 26. Comparison with the actual flow value shows that the proposed algorithm is more accurate with better fitting. Therefore, the constructed drone attack prediction model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and obvious better robustness under the premise of ensuring errors, which can provide experimental basis for the later security and intelligent development of drone system.},

  abstract={One challenge of any smart city is the management of crowded events (concerts, protests, marathons, etc.). For civil servants in charge of management, in-advance attendance prevision, real-time situational awareness and its evolution forecasting are crucial to resource assignment. These massive events put under stress public resources, organization and safety of smart cities. In this paper, we describe an ongoing effort to model urban layout, sensors deployed, and citizen information (from social networks and smartphone application) to deal with these situations. We use the concept of a digital twin applied to a city by modelling different flows of information which are integrated with a 3D virtual representation with forecasting possibilities. The main contribution of this paper is the architecture proposed and GUI using the augmented virtuality concept. The main purpose of our proposal is to facilitate the knowledge of the situation and the management of this type of event.},

  abstract={Targets of cyber crime are not exclusive to the private sector. Successful cyber attacks on nation-states have proved that cyber threats can jeopardize significant national interests. In response, nation-states have begun to handle cyber threats at the national defense level, which is titled ‘cyber defense.’ The cyber defense sector is related to national security, therefore requires robust security technology. Contrary to normal systems, blockchain provides strong security properties without a centralized control entity, and as such its application in the cyber defense field is under the spotlight. In this paper, we present opportunities blockchain provides for cyber defense, research and national projects, and limitations. We constructed a survey of government documents, interviews, related news, technical reports, and research papers from 2016 to 2021. As a result, our research contributes to reducing the gap in blockchain for cyber defense by systematically conducting research and analysis. In our research, we found that not only research but also government-led plans are actively promoting blockchain, which demonstrates that blockchain will play a remarkable role in cyber defense. This paper concludes with suggestions for future research in aspects of the blockchain technology, evaluation, and survey.},

By the implementation of this standard, industrial devices communicate with each other as well as operators, automate processes with little or no human effort, and facilitates real-time manufacturing operation. This intelligent, networked system uses a continuous exchange of data for connected operations and production. To establish a smart manufacturing platform that can enhance the accomplishment of smart factories is vital and desirable for modern manufacturing industries. At the moment, most conventional factories are faced with the challenge of migrating into smart factories, due to their inability to converge information and automation system to perform a real-time operation.

Leveraging the convergence of digital twins and cybersecurity, this research explores its role in securing critical infrastructure, using the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system as a case study. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) for SWaT encounter challenges related to requiring huge amounts of a dataset for training, being unable to adopt high data dimensionality, and adaptability to emerging threats. To address these issues, a hybrid digital twin model is proposed, combining physics-based models and data-driven approaches. This model facilitates precise attack localization and explainable IDS outcomes. The method exhibits promising capabilities for enhancing critical infrastructure security and adapting to evolving cyber threats.

  abstract={As Digital Twin technology continues to be developed for the power grid and other high value applications, the security and accuracy of the remote sensor data is of extreme importance. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation of the SHA-256 hash algorithm to create a blockchain of sensor readings. The implementation hashes the current sensor reading to the previous reading(s) from the sensor through a chained checksum SHA-256 algorithm. The enhanced chained-checksum is able to establish the trustworthiness of the communications between the control center and the remote sensor based on the length of the unbroken linked list. The chain of sensor readings act as a sophisticated checksum for the middleware communications used in the digital twin environment which often times are not secure. While the concept is based on blockchain technology, this implementation is specifically designed for two party communications, in this case the outstation and the control center. To accommodate the two party communications, the implementation allowed for the removal of some of the features commonly used in blockchain, such as consensus polling or the proof of work algorithm, and replaced them with historical values to establish the ground truth. To show the advantages of the chained checksum, the SHA-256 algorithm has been implemented in the IEEE 33-bus benchmark system in the Typhoon Hardware in the Loop (HIL) real-time simulator.},

However, due to the lack of systematic evaluation theory and method guidance, it is difficult to analyze and quantify the quality, performance, applicability or symbiosis, adaptability and value of digital twin in energy field, which seriously hinders the in-depth promotion and application of digital twin in energy field. Therefore, based on the above considerations, this paper proposes a data-driven energy digital twin quality model, which reflects the quality characteristics of energy digital twin from nine aspects: functionality, performance efficiency, ease of use, instantaneity, reliability, information security, easy maintenance, integration and intelligence.

  abstract={Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.},

  abstract={The application of Internet of Things (IoT) within industrial environments is fostering the adoption of the digital twin (DT) approach, applied at the edge of the network to handle heterogeneity stemming from siloed application management solutions and from protocols originated by different manufacturing tools and enterprise services. In this challenging context, network heterogeneity also represents a critical element that can significantly limit the design and deployment of DT-oriented applications. This article proposes the Application-driven digital twin networking middleware with the twofold objective of: 1) Simplifying the interaction among heterogeneous devices by allowing DTs to exploit IP-based protocols instead of specialized industrial ones and to enhance packet content expressiveness, by enriching data via well-defined standards. 2) Dynamically managing network resources in edge industrial environments, applying software defined networking to exploit the communication mechanisms most suitable to application requirements, ranging from native IP to more articulated based on packet content.},

  abstract={Smart city digital twins can provide useful insights by making effective use of multidisciplinary urban data from diverse sources. Whilst these insights provide new information that helps cities in decision making, verifying the authenticity, integrity, traceability and data ownership across various functional units have become critical characteristics to ensure the data is from an authentic and trustworthy source. However, these characteristics are rarely considered in a digital twin ecosystem. In this research we introduce a novel framework, namely, ‘SIGNED: Smart cIty diGital twiN vErifiable Data framework’ that is designed on the basis of data ownership, selective disclosure and verifiability principles. Using Verifiable Credentials, SIGNED ensures digital twin data are verifiably authentic i.e., it covers provenance, transparency, and reliability through verifiable presentation. A proof of concept is designed and evaluated based on a smart water management use case to demonstrate the effectiveness of SIGNED in securing verifiable exchange of digital twin data across multiple functional units. The proof-of-concept demonstrates that SIGNED successfully allows the exchange of data in a trusted and verifiable manner at negligible performance cost, thus enhancing security and alleviating privacy issues when sharing data between various functional units in a smart city.},

  abstract={Virtual reality-embedded digital twin (VR-DT) service integrates digital twin with virtual reality to visualize the digital representation of real-world production, boosting the digital transformation of manufacturing industry in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven, computing-intensive, and security-sensitive features bring challenges to the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed resource allocation scheme to improve the average Quality of Service (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment, subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation, and block size adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A fully decentralized multiagent compound-action actor–critic algorithm is developed to solve the QoS optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently improve the average QoS of the VR-DT services in a realizable way as compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract={A key application of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm lies within industrial contexts. Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT.},

  abstract={Cybersecurity research regarding the electric power grid has primarily been focused on protecting the communication layer of grid-connected devices against cyber-attack threats. Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.},

  abstract={Digital twins are becoming a key technology in evaluating hardware and system performance in wireless communications. The explosion of new use cases in time-sensitive, safety critical scenarios and the stringent requirements for new communication standards are creating a demand for repeatable and cost-effective verification methodologies. In this paper we propose a methodology for building site-specific digital twins of wireless vehicular communication links, enabling us to obtain time-variant packet error rates and asses the link reliability in safety-critical vehicular communications scenarios. The digital twin utilizes a real-time geometry-based stochastic channel model to simulate doubly selective channel frequency responses. The frequency responses are used as input to a hardware-in-the-loop setup, to obtain time-variant packet error rates between two commercial modems. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach by developing a digital twin of a multi-link vehicular scenario. Based on time-critical application requirements we use the obtained error rates to estimate the 90 % tail probability of the link level latency. In our assessment of the obtained metrics, we see how a geo-routing scenario, combining a shadowed with a relay link, can be used to increase the link reliability and reduce link latency.},

  year={2019},
  volume={7},

  pages={20325-20336},
  abstract={The concept of digital twin (DT) has emerged to enable the benefits of future paradigms such as the industrial Internet of Things and Industry 4.0. The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks; we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly. This is a potentially major obstacle in the realization of Industry 4.0 and similar concepts.},

  abstract={As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.},

  abstract={By interacting, synchronizing, and cooperating with its physical counterpart in real time, digital twin (DT) is promised to promote an intelligent, predictive, and optimized modern city. Via interconnecting massive physical entities and their virtual twins with inter-twin and intra-twin communications, the Internet of DTs (IoDT) enables free data exchange, dynamic mission cooperation, and efficient information aggregation for composite insights across vast physical/virtual entities. However, as IoDT incorporates various cutting-edge technologies to spawn the new ecology, severe known/unknown security flaws, and privacy invasions of IoDT hinder its wide deployment. Besides, the intrinsic characteristics of IoDT, such as decentralized structure, information-centric routing, and semantic communications, entail critical challenges for security service provisioning in IoDT. To this end, this article presents an in-depth review of the IoDT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, and security/privacy issues. Specifically, we first explore a novel distributed IoDT architecture with cyber–physical interactions and discuss its key characteristics and communication modes. Afterward, we investigate the taxonomy of security and privacy threats in IoDT, discuss the key research challenges, and review the state-of-the-art defense approaches. Finally, we point out the new trends and open research directions related to IoDT.},

Moreover, software tools for high-fidelity digital twin modeling are proposed. A case study on reinforcement learning-based integrated-control, communication, and computing (3C) design is developed to demonstrate the AI-driven intelligent DT-IIoT.

Given the novelty of the concept, companies from any industry type face significant challenges when implementing Digital Twins. Furthermore, only little research has been conducted in the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of representing and modeling the physics behind the production processes in an accurate manner. This study aims at filling this gap by providing a clear categorization of the main barriers that process companies face when implementing Digital Twins of their assets, as well as the key enabling factors and technologies that can be leveraged to overcome such challenges. Furthermore, a model based on the findings from the literature study is proposed.

  abstract={Road and bridge management are not an easy affair; Therefore, smart way is needed to encourage easier, cost effective, and more efficient construction monitoring and maintenance processes. Currently, road and bridge management has utilized internet of things-based sensing technology and has produced a big data. However, the data is still in silos, so it needs to be arranged into one data. This one data becomes a digital representation or ‘digital twin’ of roads and bridges. The aim of this paper is to present the concept digital twin for road and bridge management especially for construction monitoring and maintenance. This paper also discusses open problem and issues related to implementation of digital twin in West Java Province-Indonesia as a piloting project. In this study, we designed a digital twin architecture for the six-step cycle of monitoring and maintenance of road and bridge construction in West Java which consists of a survey process, technical planning, budgeting, procurement, implementation and service and permission, then the data is integrated into ‘Smart X Platforms’. As a result, we have successfully integrated 15 types of data related to road and bridge management in West Java Province. We also found problems in implementing digital twins for the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges including map availability, license ownership, security system and smart contracts, and dashboard display speed.},

This paper presents and analyses new Product Lifecycle Information Management (PLIM) with DT for managing the lifecycle of smart products in the IoT environment.

  abstract={As a novel paradigm, vehicular digital twin (VDT) aims to improve the passengers’ driving experience by using digital twins deployed in the cloud to communicate with each other. However, it is vulnerable to encounter malicious attacker which can compromise the sharing data between digital twins and further impacts the safe driving of vehicle in the physical world. In this paper, we propose an efficient group authentication and key agreement method for vehicular digital twin, named GVDT. In particular, we design a new lightweight ring cooperative authentication only needs one round to achieve implementing mutual authentication of members. In addition, we design an identity-based broadcast group key agreement scheme, which can implement dynamic key management to cope with the influence of member changes on keys. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only satisfies the security requirements of VDT, but also reduces the computation and communication costs efficiently.},

  pages={1099-1106},
  abstract={Estimating accurate torque and speed is critical to control the operation of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). But the temperature factors are usually neglected in existing studies, which degrades estimation accuracy. In this paper, a thermal-aware digital twin model is proposed for PMSM to estimate motor torque and speed with the motor temperature and d-q axis current and voltage. Firstly, the motor parameters related to torque and speed are extracted by the Spearman correlation coefficients. Moreover, the stator winding temperature is selected as the input feature. Secondly, a digital model based on BP neural networks (BPNN) is established to estimate torque and speed. Thirdly, the parameters of the BPNN model are optimized by the whale optimization algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed and avoid local optima. Finally, experimental results show that the mean square error (MSE) of the BPNN model considering the temperature factors is reduced by 8.3%, which verifies that there is an effect of temperature on the torque and speed estimation. The MSE of the proposed method is reduced by 11.7% on average, which confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed method compared with the classical BPNN model.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Nowadays, robots have been widely used in various manufacturing assemblies. However, in the mobile phone flexible printed circuit (FPC) assembly task, robots are still far from trustworthy because the connector and receiver of FPC are very small in size, and detection for them is influenced by the partial occlusion of the robot end manipulator in operation. This makes it difficult to measure the spatial relationship between the connector and receiver in robot picking and buckling. To this end, this work proposes a digital twin (DT)-driven measurement method for partial occlusion FPC assembly. The contributions include the following. First, we introduce a homography-based strategy to calibrate the FPC placement panel and its virtual placement panel in DT. It makes the partial occlusion views in physical space visible in DT within tolerable errors. This helps to improve the measurement by eliminating the observation occlusion, which originally exits in physical space. Second, we propose a DT-driven reward function measured by the distance and rotation difference between the FPC connector hold by the manipulator and its ideal position in the DT. This makes the deep architecture can learn the actions guided by the measurements of the FPC positions in physical space and DT simultaneously. The experiments are carried out on a practical assembly platform for the mobile phone Redmi Note 11. With the number of failed trails limited, the proposed network obviously outperforms the pure vision-based measurement (VBM) and the network without DT support. The proposed method provides a primitive but novel measurement strategy for mobile phone FPC assembly. It can be applied to the real mobile phone assembly lines to reduce the labor burden in the near future.},

To overcome these downsides, an innovative predictive model for Smart City security risk assessment has been developed. Risk metrics and indicators are defined by considering data coming from a wide range of sensors. An innovative “what if” algorithm is introduced to identify critical infrastructures functional relationship.

  abstract={The next generation (6G) wireless systems aim to cater to the Internet of Everything (IoE) and revolutionize customer services and applications to a fully intelligent and autonomous system. To achieve this, the digital twin edge network (DITEN) is proposed to combine mobile/multi-access edge computing (MEC) and digital twin (DT), thereby improving the network performance such as throughput and security, and reducing the cost of communication, computation, and caching. In DITENs, the network status can be continuously monitored, and based on the obtained network states, the networking schemes, such as routing and resource management, can be studied in the established DITENs from a centralized perspective. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of DITEN for 6G. First, we present the fundamental aspects of DITEN, including concept, framework, and potential. Second, a comprehensive design of DITEN is devised, including the DT modeling/updating, DT deployment, key issues, and enabling technologies. Then, the typical applications of DITEN towards 6G are provided, including the Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular network, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), healthcare, wireless systems, and other applications, along with the design of DITEN in each application, such as DT modeling, DT association, incentive mechanisms, and so on.

  abstract={The rapid process of digitalisation has an advanced impact on the industrial automation and manufacturing domain. In order to support all the upcoming technologies and paradigm changes in a future-proof way the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0) is presently developed in Germany. The requirements, such as Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for communication systems, network management, and Safety & Security, towards the Factories of the Future (FoF) are constantly increasing. The currently approached solution contains the concept of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as a general information storage and exchange point for all possible industrial assets. In consequence, the AAS needs a universal modelling concept of all mandatory information to set up the basis for automatic configuration abilities, which are desired in the Industrie 4.0 (I4.0) visions. Nevertheless, especially in the area of cyber security, which was neglected in the past and has gained a lot of attention nowadays, these modelling concepts are still missing. Therefore, this paper will provide an overview about the ongoing progress in this area, describe the related work, and outline the impending research containing a first concept for the desired Unified Security Modelling Metric (USMM).},

By simulating the nominal behavior of the system online, i.e., in parallel to the process, and continuously comparing the simulated behavior to the measured values allows to detect attacks. Their localization is facilitated through a root-cause analysis, which is also based on the model description of the plant.

  abstract={Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects the physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves and optimizes the physical systems. In this paper, we focus on studying the efficient data communication and computation when constructing the marine digital twin network with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, we leverage the federated learning (FL) to train the digital twin model. In the process of FL, all unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) deliver the trained models with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high altitude platform (HAP) for the global model aggregation. Considering the possible eavesdropping on the HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information during the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we further want to minimize the total energy consumption of completing the digital twin training by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, local accuracy, HAP's transmission power, and model uploading duration subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we propose a low-complexity search algorithm (LCS-Algorithm) to solve this joint optimization problem. Finally, the numerical results validate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimality and time efficiency.},
