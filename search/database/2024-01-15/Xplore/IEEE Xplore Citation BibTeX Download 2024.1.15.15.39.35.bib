  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoMT) has a significant and far-reaching influence on the further development of the medical sector. The Internet of Medical Things aims to enhance medical treatment by delivering smart, autonomous, timely, and emotion-aware healthcare services. Digital Twin (DT) is a potential technique and a big turning point in this field. It is anticipated that Digital Twin (DT) will alter the notion of digital health-care and move this sector to an unprecedented level. Numerous ongoing studies demonstrate the feasibility of adopting safe IoMT applications by integrating security measures within the technology itself. This article surveys new IoT and IoMT-based smart healthcare and secure methods and provides a detailed look at the most up-to-date technologies. We focus primarily on journal publications released between 2020 and 2022 and review this literature by addressing several IoT, IoMT, and AIoT research questions. We also discuss the current research challenges and suggest some potential research directions.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In the field of indoor monitoring, to analyze the track data collected by RFID readers effectively and intuitively is the critical issue. The indoor environment is usually crowded with a large number of flexible and mobile obstacles. The movements of obstacles always change the road network structure. To analyze the trajectories under the labile road network constrains is the key problem. To solve this problem, we propose a trajectory clustering method based on digital-twin technology called DTCluster. The proposed digital-twin model is a virtual digital model, which can extract and display the changing road network structure through real-time mapping and virtual simulation functions. In our paper, the original CFSFDP algorithm is improved to reduce the influence of the track missing points and to enhance the clustering effect in the face of unequal trajectories in length. We also take two parameters: the speed and the direction of moving targets into account. The trajectory clustering results in our DTCluster follow the changing road network for synchronous display on the proposed digital-twin model. It is convenient and effective for researchers to use DTCluster to find the problems which cannot be observed in the clustering results displayed in original planned road network. These problems can only be observed in the current changed road network environment. In our paper, we demonstrate the validity and intuition of DTCluster byexprimental results.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={433-438},
  abstract={The distribution, traceability, and management of shipping container logistics require secure data flow and trusted transactions. Digital Twins (DTs) can realize these features by offering shipping tracking and traceability, process flow and status monitoring, and management of the physical containersall in a remote manner. However, the data of a DT itself is typically stored, controlled, and managed by a centralized entity, which is often the original creator of the physical container. Having a centralized entity can cause mistrust. The centralized entity may alter, tamper, or delete the digital twin data. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes trusted sharing and management of DTs for shipping containers by using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFTs are digital tokens that hold unique data stored, controlled, and managed in a decentralized and immutable blockchain ledger. We extend in this paper the use of NFTs to tokenize shipping container DTs and their metadata. The proposed solution uses NFTs and Ethereum blockchain smart contracts to offer decentralization, security, transparency, traceability, and immutability to the data and processes involved in the creation, storage, and management of DTs of shipping containers. To demonstrate our solution, we create a DT of a shipping container using Microsoft Azure Digital Twins services and showed how to tokenize it using NFT. We assess the system using various test cases to evaluate its main functionalities. Furthermore, we analyze the cost of transactions and the security of the smart contracts code. We have made the code of our smart contracts publicly available on GitHub.},

  volume={9},
  number={18},
  pages={17110-17119},
  abstract={The rapid development of the automotive Industrial Internet of Things requires secure networking infrastructure toward digitalization. Cybertwin (CT) is a next-generation networking architecture that serves as a communication, and digital asset owner, and can make the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) network flexible and secure. However, CT itself can publish end users’ digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process. Smart contracts are used to enforce rules and regulations that govern the behavior of V2X entities in a nondeniable and automated manner. In a deep-learning scheme, an autoregressive-deep variational autoencoder model is combined with attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (A-BLSTM) for automatic feature extraction and attack detection by analyzing CT-edge servers data in a V2X environment. Security analysis and experimental results using two different sources, ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 show the superiority of the proposed BDTwin framework over some baseline and recent state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technology has recently attracted researchers’ and industries’ interest, becoming popular in many domains thanks to its capability to improve systems performance. This technology comprises a virtual model representing a physical entity. The physical and the virtual twins are connected to allow data sharing, aiming to provide real-time monitoring and decision processes. Human Digital Twins (HDTs) are a particular type of DTs in which the virtual twin models a human being. HDTs are applied, for instance, in healthcare to constantly monitor a patient, allowing medical staff to determine the best treatment on the DT. Although the benefits of DT and HDT are manifold, they suffer from cybersecurity risks that have only recently started to be considered. Moreover, the massive usage of HDTs poses serious privacy issues since HDTs leverage personal information that might be sensitive. In this paper, we aim to illustrate the threats affecting DTs. Then, we focus on specific threats affecting HDTs with a vision towards future research directions.},

  abstract={Modern Industry 4.0 environments are highly interconnected and have therefore an increased need for security. Protocols for machine-to-machine communication, like OPC UA, can provide this security. However, before using their security mechanisms, a trust relationship between the application and operator network first needs to be established. This trust and key exchange is performed during secure provisioning, a process often performed manually and without security in mind. In OPC UA, there are already automated provisioning mechanisms planned and partly existing, but they either involve high manual effort or cannot provide mutual authentication between application and operator network. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS), as a realization of the digital twin concept, already provides the possibility of a secured data and information exchange between manufacturer and operator. In this work, we combine the security mechanisms of OPC UA and AAS to provide a more secure and automated provisioning of new OPC UA applications.},

  pages={740-745},
  abstract={The idea of next-generation ports has become more apparent in the last ten years - in response to the challenge posed by the rising demand for efficiency and the ever-increasing volume of goods. In this new era of intelligent infrastructure and facilities, it is evident that cyber-security has recently received the most significant attention from the seaport and maritime authorities, and it is a primary concern on the agenda of most ports. Traditional security solutions like firewalls and antivirus software can be applied to safeguard IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) from harmful entities. Nevertheless, security researchers can only watch, examine, and learn about the behaviors of attackers if these solutions operate more transparently. Herein, honeypots are potential solutions since they offer valuable information about the attackers. Honeypots can be virtual or physical. Virtual honeypots must be more realistic to entice attackers, necessitating better high-fidelity. To this end, Digital Twin (DT) technology can be employed to increase the complexity and simulation fidelity of the honeypots. Seaports can be attacked from both their existing devices and external devices at the same time. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect external attacks; therefore, the current systems cannot handle attacks at the desired level. DT and honeypot technologies can be used together to tackle them. Consequently, we suggest a DT-assisted honeypot, called TwinPot, for external attacks in smart seaports. Moreover, we propose an intelligent attack detection mechanism to handle different attack types using DT technology for internal attacks. Finally, we build an extensive smart seaport dataset for internal and external attacks using the MANSIM tool and two existing datasets to test the performance of our system. We show that under both simultaneous internal and external attacks on the system, our solution successfully detects internal and external attacks.},

  abstract={A paradigm shift has occurred in the industry of manufacturing as a result of the rapid emergence and evolution of Industry 4.0. It is a process that involves increasing connectivity, automation, and data exchange. One of the most critical components of this new paradigm is the creation of a Digital Twin (DT). This technology allows companies to create and manage virtual models of their physical systems and processes. This allows them to perform simulations and improve their performance. The paper reviews the various challenges and opportunities that DT technology offers in Industry 4.0. It starts by talking about the concept of Industry 4.0, focusing on its key components, and then goes on to talk about its advantages. The paper also covers the various limitations and challenges of DT technology, such as interoperability, security, and lack of high-quality data. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the various factors that manufacturers have to consider when implementing this technology in their operations. The paper also explores the possibilities offered by DT technology to transform the manufacturing industry. Although it offers numerous advantages, it acknowledges that overcoming the challenges that DT brings can be a daunting task. In addition to investing in a robust data infrastructure, the paper also suggests that organizations establish partnerships with technology firms and develop a skilled workforce that can take advantage of DT capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the many advantages and drawbacks that DT technology has to offer in the context of Industry 4.0. Through its recommendations, it can help manufacturers overcome these obstacles. It is also useful for policymakers and researchers who are interested in learning more about the potential of this technology in their organizations.},

  pages={75365-75375},
  abstract={Digital twin technology is recently in the spotlight because of its potential applicability in business and industry. In digital twin environments, data generated from physical assets are transmitted to a remote server, which performs simulations through digital twins in a virtual space. Then, the simulation results can be shared with the data owner or other users. However, several challenges exist in the application of digital twin technology in the real world. One of the main challenges involves determining how to share real-time data for the simulation and how to share the simulation data securely. The data generated from physical assets may include sensitive information from data owners, and the leakage of data to an adversary can cause serious privacy problems. Moreover, the sharing of data with other data users should also be considered to maximize the availability of digital twin data. To resolve these issues, we propose a system model for the secure sharing of digital twin data. The proposed system model uses cloud computing for efficient data sharing and blockchain for data verifiability. We also propose communication schemes for the proposed model to guarantee privacy preservation and data security in wireless channels. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol using informal methods and formal methods such as BAN logic and the AVISPA simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare the proposed protocol with related protocols and demonstrate that the proposed scheme is applicable to digital twin environments.},

Driven by recent advances in emerging technologies such as extended reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, metaverse is stepping from science fiction to an upcoming reality. However, severe privacy invasions and security breaches (inherited from underlying technologies or emerged in the new digital ecology) of metaverse can impede its wide deployment. At the same time, a series of fundamental challenges (e.g., scalability and interoperability) can arise in metaverse security provisioning owing to the intrinsic characteristics of metaverse, such as immersive realism, hyper spatiotemporality, sustainability, and heterogeneity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the fundamentals, security, and privacy of metaverse. Specifically, we first investigate a novel distributed metaverse architecture and its key characteristics with ternary-world interactions. Then, we discuss the security and privacy threats, present the critical challenges of metaverse systems, and review the state-of-the-art countermeasures.

Unfortunately, security and privacy are some of the most challenging areas of the Metaverse, and yet, very little focus has been given to making it trustworthy. To achieve this goal, it is important to perform a thorough and systematic security analysis that would allow the adoption of proper mitigation strategies. A threat model-based analysis can help in such an analysis. This paper presents a threat model-based systematic security analysis of the Metaverse.

The results of distribution network planning has a huge impact on the operation efficiency of the power grid, the safety of electricity use, and the allocation of asset investment. This paper uses digital twinning, advanced computing and other technologies to divide and evaluate the scope of power supply, load characteristics, and user demand, and the scale of power facilities. With the power supply reliability demand as the core, it plans and builds a target network framework with high voltage quality, reasonable structure, flexible operation, and unified grid division standards, effectively giving play to the key role of planning in the construction and operation of distribution networks.},

  abstract={With the introduction of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), man-ufacturing systems are moving towards digitalization which is one of the principal visions of I4.0. In industrial automation systems, safety and security are fundamental aspects that will gain even more importance in the future, even more so as systems become more interconnected in I4.0. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is one of the key enabling concepts towards the realization of I4.0, and its generic approach ensures applicability in different areas. Nevertheless, the lack of a reference for developing such applications has led to a diverse collection of implementation efforts. This is an interoperability issue that may increase safety and security concerns in future I4.0 applications. This paper proposes a safety and security reference architecture to provide a firm ground for developing safe and secure AAS-based applications in the context of I4.0. It breaks down critical aspects of AAS development into understandable elements to facilitate decision-making for the key stakeholders, from vendors to system integrators to operators who aim to move towards I4.0 realization.},

  abstract={Using the PRISMA approach, we present the first systematic literature review of digital twin (DT) research in healthcare systems (HSs). This endeavor stems from the pressing need for a thorough analysis of this emerging yet fragmented research area, with the goal of consolidating knowledge to catalyze its growth. Our findings are structured around three research questions aimed at identifying: (i) current research trends, (ii) gaps, and (iii) realization challenges. Current trends indicate global interest and interdisciplinary collaborations to address complex HS challenges. However, existing research predominantly focuses on conceptualization; research on integration, verification, and implementation is nascent. Additionally, we document that a substantial body of papers mislabel their work, often disregarding modeling and twinning methods that are necessary elements of a DT. Furthermore, we provide a non-exhaustive classification of the literature based on two axes: the object (i.e., product or process) and the context (i.e., patient’s body, medical procedures, healthcare facilities, and public health). While this is a testament to the diversity of the field, it implies a specific pattern that could be reimagined. We also identify two gaps: (i) considering the human-in-the-loop nature of HSs with a focus on provider decision-making and (ii) implementation research. Lastly, we discuss two challenges for broad-scale implementation of DTs in HSs: improving virtual-to-physical connectivity and data-related issues. In conclusion, this study suggests that DT research could potentially help alleviate the acute shortcomings of HSs that are often manifested in the inability to concurrently improve the quality of care, provider wellbeing, and cost efficiency.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) is becoming a promising solution for vehicular networks to improve the interoperability of distributed autonomous driving systems. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to provide low-latency services for DT-enabled vehicular networks at the edge of the network. However, it is hard to obtain the dynamic network topology for moving vehicles by the ground-based MEC system, which may deteriorate the service quality for DT synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted synchronization framework for DT-enabled vehicular networks. With the proposed framework, an intelligent resource allocation algorithm is developed to improve UAV resource utilization and maximize the synchronization completion ratio. By leveraging an advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, the synchronization decisions are obtained with low time complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the synchronization latency and improve the synchronization completion ratio effectively.},

  abstract={Virtual reality (VR) innovations reached a high level of technological development making it a critical component of the metaverse of tomorrow. With the goal of VR to resemble the real world as closely as possible, data has to be collected and processed by multiple components from different manufacturers with diverse form factors. Often, these components possess vulnerabilities, which if exploited could result in poor user experiences or lead to physical, or psychological harm and financial loss. In this paper, we highlight common components of the VR world and discuss cybersecurity risks which may arise from the combination of possible threats to, and vulnerabilities within the various components. To aid security engineers in their task of securing the VR world, these components are classified into access and service layers from the perspective of the VR world user and their experiences. Our architectural analysis of VR security is the first step towards creating a security testing framework or guidance.},

Nevertheless, this deeper technological immersion amplifies the necessity for resilience against threats, encompassing both systemic outages and targeted cyberattacks. To ensure the robustness and safeguarding of vital infrastructure, a thorough examination of potential smart grid vulnerabilities and subsequent countermeasure development is essential. This study delves into the potential of digital twins, replicating a smart grid’s cyber-physical laboratory environment, thereby enabling focused cybersecurity assessments.

  abstract={Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated, which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs. MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs’ operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided. Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

  abstract={With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.},

This first step will set the stage for the proper cyber-secure and cyber-resilient design and confirm the affects that can be considered and approved by the OT and the security groups. To provide a baseline for this discussion, this paper provides a consideration of the cyber-physical interactions, possible mitigation steps against certain attacks and their corresponding affects that lend to the security design planning and evaluation process. As an integral part of the proposed scheme this work introduces the concept of system-wide fuzzer, i.e., a tool that manipulates the system state in an effort to determine mitigation response sequences that minimize detriments and maximize benefit in accordance with specified operational requirements.},

  abstract={Plants sequester carbon through photosynthesis and provide primary productivity for the ecosystem. However, they also simultaneously consume water through transpiration, leading to a carbon-water balance relationship. Agricultural production can be regarded as a form of carbon sequestration behavior. From the perspective of the natural-social-economic complex ecosystem, excessive water usage in food production will aggravate regional water pressure for both domestic and industrial purposes. Hence, achieving a harmonious equilibrium between carbon and water resources during the food production process is a key scientific challenge for ensuring food security and sustainability. Digital intelligence (DI) and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) are emerging as the new research paradigms that are causing a substantial shift in the conventional thinking and methodologies across various scientific fields, including ecological science and sustainability studies. This paper outlines our recent efforts in using advanced technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), digital twins, metaverses, and parallel intelligence to model, analyze, and manage the intricate dynamics and equilibrium among plants, carbon, and water in arid and semiarid ecosystems. It introduces the concept of the carbon-water balance and explores its management at three levels: the individual plant level, the community level, and the natural-social-economic complex ecosystem level. Additionally, we elucidate the significance of agricultural foundation models as fundamental technologies within this context. A case analysis of water usage shows that, given the limited availability of water resources in the context of the carbon-water balance, regional collaboration and optimized allocation have the potential to enhance the utilization efficiency of water resources in the river basin. A suggested approach is to consider the river basin as a unified entity and coordinate the relationship between the upstream, midstream and downstream areas. Furthermore, establishing mechanisms for water resource transfer and trade among different industries can be instrumental in maximizing the benefits derived from water resources. Finally, we envisage a future of agriculture characterized by the integration of digital, robotic and biological farming techniques. This vision aims to incorporate small tasks, big models, and deep intelligence into the regular ecological practices of intelligent agriculture.},

Herein, a unified AMI system across security zones was designed, which used the digital twin auxiliary information system as a supporting system to simulate a multi-service data model. With the comprehensive analysis of the digital twin auxiliary information system to the running results from the model, the collection system could grasp the needs of the application system in real time, thereby dynamically adjusting collection frequency. Furthermore, field running test on this system was carried out in the Measurement Center of Shenzhen Power Supply Bureau, and it verified that the system had the ability to collect data in seconds. the simulation results were analyzed to adjust collection time interval taking load forecasting and spot trading business as examples, using forecast accuracy and power purchase cost as indicators. Finally, it is determined that when the collection frequency is one minute, it could meet the indicator that the average absolute percentage error of load forecast was less than 1%. And in the meantime, the purchase cost deviation of the electricity sellers was much smaller than the 2% error specified by the standard.},

  abstract={A Digital Twin is envisioned as a natural evolution with regard to the integration of physical and virtual environments with application in various domains such as organization management, products, services, e-health, business intelligence. It consists of a virtual model of a physical object, which dynamically pairs the physical entity with it’s digital replica. The e-health applications are heterogeneous and complex by nature, having a great variability, so is difficult to be managed and monitored through a unique ICT system. A Digital Twin is envisioned to connect the physical world associated to healthcare and the cyber world. Relevant patient and hospital environment information are stored in the Electronic Health Record (EHR). There is an expectation that the traditional Electronic Medical Records, EHR, will be enhanced or even replaced by Digital Twins. This paper discusses a generic Digital Twin based approach in healthcare, which extends the EHR capabilities, within a framework of interoperability that enables the possibility of developing complex e-health applications is presented. Physical collected healthcare information, EHR data and Digital Twin processed outputs are available as services for the users, within a Service Oriented Architecture. The data traffic with the Digital Twin – EHR framework is realized through Web services, which are able to assure security, safety and privacy of the medical transmitted information, in a QoS approach.},

  abstract={Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) Knowledge Graphs Embedding (KGE) complete the tasks such as KG complementation by retaining the structural information of the graph and mining the implicit relations between entities, which can help security organizations analyze potential threat information and improve the cybersecurity protection capabilities. However, learning graph data in CTI is challenging for the data sparsity and their heterogeneity, it is critical to consider how to deal with complex graph data and aggregate multiple types of semantic information simultaneously. To solve the heterogeneity of KGEs in CTI, we propose a heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence GNNs model Relational-Multi-Head-Graph-Attention-Networks (R-MGAT). Specifically, the importance of different relations is firstly learned through a multi-head attention mechanism. Then the neighbor features of different entities are learned under each relation. Finally, the weight entities and the relation-based feature are aggregated to generate the embedding representation. In this way, our model could capture various types of semantic information and selectively aggregate informative features. What’s more, we manually constructed a CTI KG by annotating APT reports in response to the lack of public datasets in CTI fields. We use entity classification and link prediction to verify our R-MGAT model. A series of benchmark experiments illustrate that RMGAT can generate competitive performance in KGE.},

  abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a novel computing paradigm to satisfy the increasing computation requirements of mobile applications. In MEC-enabled intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the latency-sensitive computing tasks are offloaded to RSUs for execution, reducing the transmission latency compared with the cloud solutions. However, the repetitive executions of the same tasks whose outputs are dependent on the inputs lead to the extra system latency, an alternative is to cache the required services on RSUs in advance. The service requirements of latency-sensitive computing tasks are satisfied by jointly considering computation offloading and service caching. Besides, the digital twin (DT) is utilized to construct the virtual world reflecting the physical world in real-time to efficiently make offloading strategies. In this paper, a computation offloading and service caching method using decision theory in ITS with DT, named CODT, is proposed. Specifically, the computation offloading and service caching in ITS is modeled first with DT. Then, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to minimize the system latency. Afterward, the decision theory is used to analyze the utilities of offloading strategies in different states of RSUs and make the optimal strategy. Finally, extensive simulations based on the real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed CODT outperforms other baselines.},

  abstract={Electromagnetic (EM) brakes are widely applied in many automation and control fields. Assembly quality defects in EM brakes can significantly reduce braking performance and pose potential safety risks. The primary challenge in assembly quality control is the ability to predict product quality and prevent potential failures. In view of the lack of quality information interaction and real-time feedback in the traditional quality prediction process, an intelligent predictive quality control model for the assembly process of EM brakes is proposed in this paper. First, we introduce an assembly quality control model based on digital twin (DT) technology. Second, a data-driven quality prediction algorithm is developed using least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and improved particle swarm optimisation (IPSO). To reduce the complexity of the prediction process, grey relational analysis (GRA) is used to analyse and extract key quality characteristics data. EM friction brakes are employed as an example to analyse the product assembly process, and the results provide valuable insights into the implementation of DT technology. Finally, the feasibility of the developed prediction model is verified with real assembly datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and precision of the DT model and the GRA-IPSO-LSSVR method in predicting assembly quality.},

  abstract={For future networks, it is highly demanding to satisfy a wide range of time-sensitive and computation-intensive services. This is a very challenging task, since it requires a combination of aspects from information, communication and computation in order to establish a digital representation of the real network environment. This paper introduces a fairness-aware latency minimisation (FALM) framework in the digital twin (DT) aided edge computing with ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), which jointly optimises various communication and computation parameters, namely, bandwidth allocation, transmission power, task offloading portions, and processing rate of user equipments (UEs) and edge servers (ESs). The formulated problem is highly complicated, due to non-convex constraints and strong coupling among optimisation variables. To deal with this problem, we develop both centralised and distributed optimisation approaches. In particular, we first resort to successive convex approximation (SCA) method to develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm and solve the problem in a centralised manner. Combining tools from SCA and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we develop an efficient distributed solution with parallel computation processing at ESs under global consensus in each iteration and strong theoretical performance guaranteed. Numerical results are provided to validate the proposed solutions in terms of convergence speed and overall latency as well as improving fairness among all UEs.},

  abstract={Medical Recommendation Service (MRS) can provide simple diagnostics and recommend a suitable doctor for patients when they input their disease symptoms by using AI and big data. However, people may be unwilling to share medical data due to data privacy issues and a lack of incentives, which makes it hard for MRS to continue to develop. Until now, there are no efficient solutions. To solve this, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reward mechanism for medical recommendation (BARM) in smart healthcare. The proposed scheme uses accumulator, commitment, and Signatures of Knowledge (SoK) to provide anonymous rewards for users to mobilize more users to share data as much as possible. And we design a smart contract that can provide submit, query, and revoke functions to realize anonymous authentication of patients. The formal security analysis shows that the proposed scheme meets the required security requirements. Detailed performance analysis results show that the computation cost and communication cost of the scheme is feasible, which can be applied to the medical recommendation scenario of anonymous protection and promote the development of smart healthcare.},

  abstract={As a popular trust infrastructure, the blockchain is applied in many fields. However, it faces many security problems. Anomaly detection can find operation anomalies including attacks in blockchain. However, existing methods merely cover limited attack types where a critical and harmful type which affects the generation of blocks is still out of consideration. To expand the detect ability for more attacks, we propose LogBlock, a log-based anomaly detection method, aiming at securing permissioned blockchain by using Fabric as an example. First, we construct a specialized dataset containing normal logs, fault logs and attack logs by implementing various real attacks. Second, in order to mitigate the impact on log sequence pattern caused by transaction concurrency, LogBlock designs an analysis method with the log-block sequence. Specifically, logs are divided into log-blocks, whose sequence pattern will be learned by CNN with Transformer to train particular model. Based on the model, anomaly detection is performed to locate the anomalous logs. Experimental evaluations show that LogBlock is more suitable for anomaly detection on the blockchain compared with existing log-based anomaly detection methods.},

  abstract={Attention to cyber security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has led to the development of innovative cyber-resilient methodologies to ensure early detection and mitigation of cyber anomalies and threats. The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.},

IT/OT convergence opens new pathways to design and operate intelligent cyber-physical systems, such as the Digital Twin (DT) concept, which has been discovered as key technology by several industries. This paper describes how centralized and decentralized DTs can help to monitor and control future power systems with special consideration of their interaction in case of corrupted communication from cyber-attacks. While the virtual representation of substations is regarded from the edge computing perspective the control room of the interconnected power system represents the centralized perspective. The concepts allows to have a system wide perspective, while also keeping detailed information at hand. The future system operator in the control room will benefit from services provided by DTs analytical and control features, rising resilience to cyber-physical anomalies and enhance situational awareness.},

  abstract={Healthcare has always been a very profitable and resource-intensive industry, and it is also one of the only ones that have never reached a digital transformation peak. A network of 3D virtual worlds centered on social interaction is known as a metaverse. As the world becomes more dependent on technology, more consideration must be given to both individual privacy and the solutions offered by cybersecurity companies. In the metaverse, patient data security is a challenge. High-tech wearables including glasses, gloves, sensors, and other wearables that can detect patients' vital signs are needed in order to fully utilize the metaverse in healthcare. Technology is constrained since the hardware is still pricey and cannot be accessed by many members of society. The health Metaverse framework primarily focuses on telemedicine and online health management, multimodal medical information standards, the fusion of medical and social data, and medical artificial intelligence. Additionally, it offers crucial inventive dynamism in surgical procedures, medical education, and the interactions between service providers and clients. Technology improvements, gamification of healthcare, patient privacy protection, and barriers stopping individuals from giving up reality are all obstacles. This technological advancement had a lot to offer the ailing medical infrastructure industry, including telemedicine services, virtual examinations employing VR, AR, and blockchain to assure secure data and financial transmissions, as well as a variety of other as-yet untapped possibilities. Data security, data interoperability, and laws are just a few of the difficulties that the healthcare sector in the metaverse will face. To address these issues, new infrastructure, standards, and procedures will be required. This study looks at a number of issues that affect the healthcare industry and how to address them when the metaverse enters the mainstream of healthcare.},

Furthermore, for the first time Cellular Automata and Digital Twins are combined to predict and simulate the fire spreading inside the building.

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.},

  abstract={Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats. Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems.},

  abstract={Cultural Heritage Buildings need to be preserved through interventions and actions that ensure accessibility and availability to present and future generations. The diffusion o f new technologies, including low-cost sensors and devices, has introduced many possibilities and strategies to monitor environments, including Historical and Cultural value buildings. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, modern devices and sensors can collect and manage helpful information to build a Digital Twin of the surrounding environment. In this scenario, reproducing a Digital Twin of Cultural Heritage Buildings could be crucial to monitoring, managing, and performing action aiming to protect them. One of the challenges in recent years is the automatic analysis of collected information. This paper introduces a novel approach to protecting Buildings using Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM), which leverages a sensor network and Deep Learning techniques to analyze sensor data. A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform. Then, collected data are analyzed through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to prevent future issues related to Cultural Heritage Buildings, particularly humidity inside structures, which is crucial for ancient building preservation.},

The shared images can be further presented in different formats including QR. codes, paper, clothes and audio watermarking, which is convenient for key recovery. Moreover, the wallet updates new shared images each time in hot media ensuring the security.

These services are typically implemented as software applications in various application domains, e.g., healthcare, cooperative robotic systems, and autonomous vehicles. However, to assure continued safe operations of the critical services with strict real-time requirements even when the service is under attack is an extremely challenging task mainly because the underlying operating environment for such applications is highly volatile yet distributed. To this end, first, we classify (as we call it) timed resilience requirements into computational and communication resilience and then discuss key challenges that hinder the modeling of such requirements to help develop rigorous distributed applications for real-time resilient autonomous systems. Finally, we demonstrate our vision to handle these challenges by introducing by-design and by-response approaches that consider security as a prerequisite of the safety and resilience of autonomous systems.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) constructs virtual counterparts of physical devices to monitor and optimize their life cycle processes. With the emergence of industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has became the backbone of the DT by providing a fundamental way to transform physical devices to their virtual counterparts. With the deployment of IIoT, built-in sensors enable real-time collection of critical DT data involving various physical parameters associated with devices during their life cycle. However, traditional data sharing services rely on a centralized infrastructure, which inevitably brings severe security threats to share large volume of sensitive DT data derived from numerous sensors. To address the above issue, this paper presents a blockchain based Multi-users Oblivious Data Sharing scheme (MODS) for the digital twin system in the context of IIoT. MODS supports a broad range of security properties including confidentiality, obliviousness, and access control for the DT data stored on the blockchain. MODS adopts a hybrid design approach by combing trusted hardware and cryptography to achieve well balances between security and efficiency. To demonstrate the design advantages of MODS, we explore the design space of a multi-users oblivious data sharing scheme by using pure cryptographic approach, which incurs several design tradeoffs that must be addressed. We show that MODS performs well in these tradeoffs. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that MODS is practical to support secure data sharing via blockchain for IIoT.},

  abstract={Smart factories manage digital twins (DTs) to evaluate the performance of various what-if production scenarios. This article presents a DT consistency-checking approach to maintain DT in high fidelity by checking whether each sensed timed event from the physical manufacturing plant is under its corresponding DT-based estimations in runtime. The approach targets DTs developed using time colored Petri net (TCPN). To build the candidates of the next observable event with observable time margins, we considered the stochastic property of the plant, frequent external actuation caused by a new order, machine maintenance, etc., as well as intermediate unobservable state transitions reaching the sensible events. Based on the considerations, we propose an iterative method to build the virtual estimates for streaming physical events using efficiently evolved state-class graphs (SCGs). We also propose a TCPN partitioning method to accelerate the SCG-evolution and make DT maintenance easier by supporting the isolation of inconsistent subnets being diagnosed. We applied the approach to a USB flash-drive factory to prove the concept and evaluated the performance under various situations to show speedups of the SCG evolution, that is the crucial overhead of the estimation.},

In recent years, the concepts of IoRT and DTw have captured the interest of the surgical sector. The flawless integration of data between a physical and virtual machine in either direction is the best way to conduct smart surgery. Artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, various kinds of robotic equipment, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are our pillars of completing the task.

  abstract={Over the past few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the healthcare sector through the introduction of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology whose purpose is the improvement of the patient's quality of life. Nevertheless, I0MT networks are still vulnerable to a wide range of threats because of their heterogeneity and resource-constrained characteristics. Thus, novel security mechanisms such as accurate and efficient intrusion detection systems (IDSs), taking into consideration the inherent limitations of the I0MT networks, are required to be developed before I0MT networks reach their full potential in the market. In our previous works, we presented the system architecture of a novel hybrid anomaly-based IDS (AIDS) for I0MT networks and the implementation of its prototype. The next step is the testing and evaluation of the performance of the proposed AIDS under different types of attacks. However, there is a lack of existing IoT testbeds that can be used to test and evaluate the performance of an AIDS as a whole system running on different IoT devices, networks and platforms, and being under different types of IoT attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we present the development of a functional IoT/IoMT security testbed for testing and evaluating AIDSs. In addition, we intend this work to serve as a guidance for other researchers or engineers who aim to develop specific IoT/IoMT testbeds for evaluating their own AIDSs under different types of IoT attacks.},

  abstract={Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as haptics, human-computer interaction, and extended reality, using the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems have diverse requirements in terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance metrics. Therefore, enabling IoE applications over 6G requires a new framework that can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the 6G wireless system and its underlying IoE services. Such a new framework for 6G can be based on digital twins. Digital twins use a virtual representation of the 6G physical system along with the associated algorithms (e.g., machine learning, optimization), communication technologies (e.g., millimeter-wave and terahertz communication), computing systems (e.g., edge computing and cloud computing), as well as privacy and security-related technologists (e.g., blockchain). First, we present the key design requirements for enabling 6G through the use of a digital twin. Next, the architectural components and trends such as edge-based twins, cloud-based-twins, and edge-cloud-based twins are presented. Furthermore, we provide a comparative description of various twins. Finally, we outline and recommend guidelines for several future research directions.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence combined with the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can improve the performance of automatic driving and service quality of vehicles. However, data privacy protection of IoV has become a challenging problem. In order to effectively protect user data security and reduce resource consumption, we propose a lightweight homomorphic encryption federated learning framework based on blockchain. Firstly, we combine federated learning with blockchain to train a global model collaboratively without sharing their raw data. Meanwhile, the aggregation of shared models is conducted in the on-chain nodes of the blockchain instead of a single server with traditional federated learning. Secondly, considering the further security of the sharing model on the chain, we design a lightweight homomorphic encryption approach because of the high computational cost with the existing homomorphic encryption federated learning. Finally, we conducted comparison experiments with existing homomorphic encryption federated learning schemes, and the experimental results show that our scheme can effectively protect data privacy and reduce computational costs and storage space.},

  pages={112975-112988},
  abstract={Modern power systems have been expanding significantly including the integration of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, bringing a tremendous computational challenge to transient stability simulation for dynamic security assessment (DSA). In this work, a practical method for energy control center with the machine learning (ML) based synchronous generator model (SGM) and dynamic equivalent model (DEM) is proposed to reduce the computational burden of the traditional transient stability (TS) simulation. The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT) digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM, where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT®. A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg 500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid, multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of AC-DC grid.},

  abstract={Eclipse Arrowhead is an open-source framework for industrial automation based on service-oriented principles. It allows the creation of a highly flexible System of Systems (SoS) by defining local clouds for connecting application systems running on industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs). However, in an ICPS context, resource constraints and battery-powered devices are facing issues such as high energy consumption, poor service availability, and low-security capabilities. The concept of Digital Twins (DTs) as a proxy (DTaaP) has been defined to address these CPS challenges by providing valuable properties such as energy efficiency, availability, and security. In this paper, we propose a solution to empower the Eclipse Arrowhead Framework (EAF) with DTaaP. Specifically, the proposed solution introduces AHDitto, an Arrowhead-compliant supporting core system, enabling EAF to achieve three DTaaP properties by integrating Eclipse Ditto with EAF.},

  year={2022},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In-depth analysis of medical data through machine learning to achieve disease prediction is beneficial to the early detection and treatment of diseases. However, medical data involves mass patient privacy, and datasets of different medical institutions cannot be directly shared due to privacy protection. So medical data often exists in the form of data islands, which makes it difficult for most existing prediction models to complete disease prediction. In this paper, a digital twin assisted efficient clustering Federated Learning (FL) algorithm for disease prediction is proposed. It can break data islands to predict diseases on the premise of privacy security. Firstly, we design an efficient clustering Federated Learning with Client Selection (FLCS) protocol based on heterogeneity and contribution to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Secondly, we use digital twin to assist the FLCS protocol to carry out large-scale prediction. In addition, the shapley value introduced in the calculation of client contribution makes the model interpretable and enhances the reliability of prediction results. Finally, the evaluation results show that compared with the common prediction models and FedAvg algorithm, the FLCS protocol assisted by digital twin has better efficiency and accuracy in binary classification prediction.},

  pages={2052-2060},
  abstract={The integration of Internet of Things (IoT)-based highway bridge structural health monitoring (HBSHM) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) plays an essential role in detecting damage for large and complex bridge structures. The HBSHM provides ITS with bridge health condition information for real-time traffic management. The ITS provides HBSHM with the required traffic data to improve the HBSHM system’s accuracy and reliability. Node deployment optimization (NDO) is critical in HBSHM as sensor node deployment directly affects the quality of collected data. To better solve the NDO problem in HBSHM, a novel hybrid cat-artificial fish swarm algorithm (CAT-AFSA) based on the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) and Cat Swarm optimization (CSO) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm introduces seeking and tracing behaviors of CSO into AFSA, which effectively expands the search space of artificial fish and reduces the blind search of it. The performance of the CAT-AFSA is first tested using four benchmark functions, and then its validity and feasibility for the NDO are verified using an engineering example. The simulations demonstrate that the CAT-AFSA has better search performance and computational efficiency compared with the AFSA and CSO. The CAT-AFSA has a broad application prospect in the field of NDO in civil engineering.},

  abstract={The drones provide an active measure to identify, monitor, analyze and resolve risks of autonomous systems during operational phase. To date, however, the published studies have not considered them for managing risks in a dynamic manner. The capability to deal with unknowns and uncertainties during operational phase is regarded as essential to exploit the autonomous systems at their full potential. This paper targets the drone-based assurance of autonomous systems. The hazard and threat analyses are performed during design and development phase by using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and Threat and Operability (THROP) techniques, respectively. Based on the analyses results, the safety and security requirements are derived. The assume-guarantee contracts are also derived for uncertainty sources; they are integrated in the blockchain-based smart contracts. The simulators are leveraged for performing the verification and validation as well as improving systems. For assuring safety and security during operational phase, the contracts derived for uncertainty sources are checked. In case of divergence, the drones provide assistance; otherwise, depending on the severity risk factor, system control is taken to avoid the mishap risk. The applicability of the proposed methodology is exemplified in the context of a quarry site production scenario.},

  abstract={To meet the future demands for ubiquitous communication coverage and temporary / unexpected computing resources, aerial computing networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. Nevertheless, dynamic changes on the network make it particularly challenging to achieve global optimal resource allocation. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) can represent real objects in physical network by creating virtual models. With the help of DT, we can easily obtain comprehensive real-world high-fidelity state information for model training, so as to achieve intelligent efficient decision-making. Accordingly, DT-based aerial computing networks have emerged as a potential solution. Note that available researches mostly assumed simple ground user distribution like uniform distribution, and adopted binary / partial offloading in task processing, neglecting the task separability and data inter-dependency among subtasks. Toward this end, we introduce DT into aerial computing networks, and study the problem of intelligent UAV deployment and resource allocation. Specifically, we firstly propose a DT-assisted UAV deployment strategy and model the data inter-dependency among subtasks. After that, two DT-assisted hybrid (binary and partial) task offloading schemes are presented, i.e., heuristic greedy and DQN-based schemes. Extensive analysis and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed DT-assisted UAV deployment and hybrid task offloading strategies.},

  abstract={Channel coding is an efficient approach for data transmission in the wireless network, blind recognition of channel codes plays a pivotal role in non-cooperative communication and spectral scrutiny. But there are some difficulties in the low accuracy and robustness of the current research, meanwhile, most of them analyze this problem to take the coding type as the prior knowledge, which may be unknown in the actual condition. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional feature extraction algorithm, that identifies channel coding types and parameters by the neural network. A data randomness based multi-dimensional feature extraction algorithm and efficient channel attention for deep convolution neural network (ECA-Net) are used in the proposed recognizer, it had an outstanding performance in the identification of coding types, coding lengths, and coding rates. Simulation experiments showed that the proposed recognizer could realize the recognition of coding types, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not lower than 10dB, it could achieve above 70% of identification accuracy. On the other hand, it can improve the probability of detection by 10% to 60% compared with previous work for coding lengths and coding rates, which testifies the availability of this approach.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), and Federated Learning (FL) are redefining the future vision of globalization. While IoT is about sensing data from physical devices, DTs reflect their digital representation and enable optimized decision-making by tightly integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although swiftly growing, DTs are raising new challenges in privacy concerns, which are nowadays addressed by FL. However, the limited IoT resources, the communication overhead, and the lack of trust among clients are major obstacles that hinder the effectiveness of learning systems. In this paper, we design a new IoT-based architecture empowered by DT to improve the efficiencies of limited-resources devices. On top of this architecture, we leverage FL to construct the DT models. We further propose CISCO-FL, a Clustered FL with Intelligent Selection and Computation Offloading. Particularly, we study the computing resources of the clients and the quality of their models, and we embed in the proposed approach an intelligent offloading model, where the clients with high computational resources can assist and optimize the model of those struggling with limited resources. As such, both communication cost and computation resources are reduced and optimized. Finally, thorough experimental results are presented to support our findings and validate our model.},

  abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.},

  abstract={The concept of metaverses has received extensive attention recently and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is its academic foundation. In almost all the applications of metaverses, the sensing system is an essential part and intelligent sensing capacity must be provided. However, due to the insufficient consideration of human factors in most of the studies, digital twins’ sensing in cyber-physical systems cannot achieve smart sensing in metaverses. For this reason, a novel framework for intelligent sensing in metaverses, MetaSensing, is proposed based on parallel intelligence in CPSS. Within the framework of MetaSensing, there are four states of sensing: physical sensing, descriptive sensing, predictive sensing, and prescriptive sensing. To protect sensors’ data privacy in metaverses, DAO-based decentralized sensing is introduced as a mechanism of the operation and maintenance for smart sensing industries.},

  abstract={The age of digitization is changing the way universities need to educate their engineering graduates. Thus, universities must train their graduates with the skills required in the era of digitization. In this regard universities face significant pressure to overhaul their established sometimes traditional curriculums and expand them by focusing on methodologies and technologies required as skills in the 21st century. In this regard technology enhanced learning methods are essential while flexible to provide engineering students with the respective skills in complex system design in the manufacturing domain. This technology enhanced learning approach also helps to overcome education lags caused by the COVID 19 pandemic. The digital transformative impact on intelligent manufacturing also requires dealing with risk management with regard to vulnerability through cyber threat attacks.

  year={2022},

  pages={25643-25659},
  abstract={Sharing is undoubtedly one of the most important features of 6G networks, and blockchain can provide an extended trust-as-a-service (TAAS) distributed sharing solution for 6G networks. However, as a special distributed technology system, blockchain naturally needs to face the “impossible triangle” problem: in the case of ensuring security and decentralization, scalability will inevitably become the Achilles heel of the blockchain system. This article will design a high-throughput blockchain system for 6G networks to achieve trusted sharing and efficient scheduling of network infrastructure, assist future networks in integrating an open Internet architecture, and realize the combination of openness and distributed control. We adopt a shard blockchain design and incorporate digital twins and federated learning; formulate an optimization model for maximizing the throughput of the blockchain network by getting the optimal number of shards, also analyzing other factors affecting the throughput such as service distribution; propose a security performance analysis model for the blockchain network to describe the measures taken against the Byzantine attacks on the network. Analysis and simulation results show that the transaction throughput of the proposed method can reach more than 30 times larger than that of a nonsharding scheme. They also show that when one-third of the nodes in the system are attacked, the consensus of the system is hardly affected; even if the number of nodes being attacked at the same time reaches half of the total number of nodes, the probability of the occurrence of failed shards is still less than  $10^{-4}$ , and the system still has good survivability.},

First, we aim at providing an objective analysis of requirements that need to be fulfilled by metaverse platforms. We survey a broad set of criteria including interoperability, immersiveness, persistence, multimodal and social interaction, scalability, level of openness, configurability, market access, security, and blockchain integration, among others. Second, we review a wide range of existing metaverse platforms, and we critically evaluate their ability to meet the requirements listed. We identify their limitations, which must be addressed to establish fair, trustworthy, and interactive experiences within the metaverse ecosystem. Looking forward, we highlight the need for further research and development in areas such as decentralization, improved security and privacy measures, and the integration of emerging technologies like blockchain and AI, as essential building blocks for a resilient and secure metaverse.},

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={The use of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) in vehicular networks can lead to better connectivity, reliability, and performance. However, communication in this setting is often done over an unsecured wireless network, which creates a challenge in verifying the validity of received transactions by Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to the untrusted network. It also creates a potential for attackers to tamper with the data content and conduct different IoV-related attacks. To address these issues, a new framework called “STIoV” has been proposed for secure and trustworthy communication in IoV. The framework includes a mutual authentication scheme to register and exchange session keys among the IoV participants, and a credit-based trust management system to assign reputation scores for the vehicular devices. The latter scheme discards transactions with low credit scores. To overcome the complexity and variability of the IoV network, digital twin technology is used to map Road Side Units (RSU) servers into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the vehicular relation model. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on deep learning techniques is also introduced to detect anomalies in the traffic flow. The legitimate data is further used by the blockchain scheme for transaction verification, block creation and addition. Finally, the proposed framework has been evaluated based on two network intrusion datasets, and the results show the accuracy and efficacy of STIoV in comparison to several recent state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={A Security Operation Centre (SOC) is a powerful and versatile infrastructure for cybersecurity due to the capabilities of monitoring and improving the security posture of an organization. While they found great diffusion in companies to defend IT/OT infrastructures, their employment in the maritime domain is still narrow but required. Nevertheless, SOC analysts working in traditional SOCs may be unprepared to operate proficiently in the maritime environment due to its context-specific features. They require specific training to fully exploit these newfound requirements. In this work, we leverage the NICE framework to outline the profile definition of a SOC operator in terms of required knowledge and skills. This profile allowed us to define the requirements of a training program tailored for maritime SOC operators. Moreover, we show how this program can be fulfilled with targeted hands-on exercises. An example exercise set in a representative scenario highlights that we are able to train the specific skills with metrics for evaluating their proficiency.},

  abstract={A key challenge faced by small and medium-sized business entities is securely managing software updates and changes. Specifically, with rapidly evolving cybersecurity threats, changes/updates/patches to software systems are necessary to stay ahead of emerging threats and are often mandated by regulators or statutory authorities to counter these. However, security patches/updates require stress testing before they can be released in the production system. Stress testing in production environments is risky and poses security threats. Large businesses usually have a non-production environment where such changes can be made and tested before being released into production. Smaller businesses do not have such facilities. In this work, we show how “digital twins”, especially for a mix of IT and IoT environments, can be created on the cloud. These digital twins act as a non-production environment where changes can be applied, and the system can be securely tested before patch release. Additionally, the non-production digital twin can be used to collect system data and run stress tests on the environment, both manually and automatically. In this paper, we show how using a small sample of real data/interactions, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can be used to generate testing scenarios to check for points of failure.},

  abstract={At present, the airborne system has realized the ability of autonomous flight to a certain extent by relying on relevant communication, navigation, surveillance and automation technologies, but it still cannot meet the ultimate vision of "free flight". As the next generation of intelligent system, the cyber-physical system can be closely integrated with the airborne system to further improve the real-time perception and autonomous flight capability of the aircraft, providing a strong impetus for the implementation of the performance-based "third-generation air traffic management". The airborne cyber-physical system uses advanced sensing, communication and control technologies to realize the closed-loop flow of airborne communication, navigation and surveillance data, complete the dynamic optimization of resources, and ensure the safe, reliable and efficient autonomous operation of the aircraft. At present, the relevant research and application of cyber-physical system are mainly concentrated in smart grid, and the research results of cyber-physical system in aviation field are few and unsystematic. This paper attempts to integrate the cyber-physical system with the airborne system for the first time. The components of airborne cyber-physical system are studied in detail, the networked airborne cyber-physical system model is designed, and the corresponding security analysis is carried out. In addition, from the perspective of combining with emerging technologies such as distributed computing, the new application prospect of airborne cyber-physical system is outlined. Finally, the challenges that the airborne cyber-physical system may face in the design and development stage are discussed. It is hoped that this paper will bring some inspiration to the relevant research of academia and aviation industry, and provide a useful reference for the research and design of the next generation network-centric and intelligent airborne system.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of modeling a printing-imaging channel built on a machine learning approach a.k.a. digital twin for anti-counterfeiting applications based on copy detection patterns (CDP). The digital twin is formulated on an information-theoretic framework called Turbo that uses variational approximations of mutual information developed for both encoder and decoder in two-directional information passage. The proposed model generalizes several state-of-the-art architectures such as adversarial autoencoder (AAE) [1], CycleGAN [2] and adversarial latent space auto-encoder (ALAE) [3]. This model can be applied to any type of printing and imaging and it only requires training data consisting of digital templates or artworks that are sent to a printing device and data acquired by an imaging device. Moreover, these data can be paired, unpaired or hybrid paired-unpaired which makes the proposed architecture very flexible and scalable to many practical setups. We demonstrate the impact of various architectural factors, metrics and discriminators on the overall system performance in the task of generation/prediction of printed CDP from their digital counterparts and vice versa. We also compare the proposed system with several state-of-the-art methods used for image-to-image translation applications. The code and extended results of the simulation are publicly available1.},

At this juncture, it is essential to establish a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research. In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical, biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv) precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data, compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i) cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security and privacy schemes.},
