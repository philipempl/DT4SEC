  abstract={5G positioning will be a natural component in many anticipated 5G industrial use cases and verticals such as logistics, smart factories, autonomous vehicles, localized sensing, digital twins, augmented and virtual reality. Driven by the aim to support such a wide array of location-aware services and applications, the current release of 5G is exploring positioning as an integral part of 5G technology. In recent years, many attacks on positioning systems have been demonstrated, and hence it is important to build 5G systems that are resilient to location manipulation attacks. In this paper, we describe our vision for the secure 5G positioning infrastructure, which requires support from architecture, positioning protocols, and secure physical layer designs. We discuss that the designs should be optimized for the use cases, as a single higher layer protocol and a physical layer are insufficient to fulfill all applications' availability, latency, security, and privacy requirements. We further discuss positioning for autonomous vehicles where secure 5G positioning will help in collision avoidance, phantom vehicle detection, and navigation in the presence of an adversary.},

  abstract={Service providers, 5G network operators and, more generally, vertical industries face today a dangerous shortage of highly skilled cybersecurity experts. Along with the escalation and growing sophistication of cyber-attacks, 5G networks require the training of skilled and highly competent cyber forces. To meet these requirements, the SPIDER cyber range focuses specifically on 5G, and is based on three pillars, (i) cyber security assessment, (ii) training cyber security teams to defend against complex cyber-attack scenarios, and (iii) evaluation of cyber risk. The SPIDER cyber range replicates a customized 5G network, enabling the execution of cyber-exercises that take advantage of hands-on interaction in real time, the sharing of information between participants, and the gathering of feedback from network equipment, as well as the development and adaptation of advanced operational procedures. This aims to help 5G security professionals improve their ability to collaboratively manage and predict security incidents, complex attacks, and propagated vulnerabilities. The SPIDER cyber range is validated in two relevant use case scenarios aimed at demonstrating, in a realistic, measurable, and replicable way the transformations SPIDER will bring to the cybersecurity industry.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Heterogeneous robot teams face challenges in reducing human interventions due to robot failure and environmental challenges in dangerous unstructured environments. It is therefore necessary to create a methodology to assess robot fleet failure rates to reduce the requirement for costly human intervention. A solution to this problem includes robots with the ability to work together symbiotically to overcome mission resilience challenges. However, robotic platforms generally lack built-in interconnectivity with other platforms from different vendors. This work aims to tackle this issue by enabling the functionality through a bidirectional digital twin. The twin enables the human operator to transmit and receive information to and from the heterogeneous multi-robot fleet. This digital twin considers autonomy for mission resilience and human-led decision making to enable the resilience of a multi-robot fleet. Decision-making within the digital twin triggers the symbiotic digital architecture to preserve mission continuity via adaptive planning in the robotic team. This creates the cooperation, corroboration, and collaboration of diverse robots to leverage the capability via a multi robot fleet, supporting the recovery of a failed robot. This research enables for robots to overcome resilience issues ahead of the requirement for human intervention.},

  abstract={The digitalization of the construction industry has been supported recently with various building information modelling (BIM) methods applied to lifecycle stages. This has enabled the transition towards an improved management of information required in the development of different construction project tasks. In a digital construction context, traceability of models and collaboration across disciplines is required especially when dealing with sensitive data and critical infrastructures. Blockchain technology has the potential to advance the automation of processes in the construction industry by offering a higher level of data traceability, incentivising participation, and ensuring transparency with projects. This paper presents how BIM and Blockchain can be utilised to facilitate the establishment and implementation of Digital Twins for construction projects.

  pages={16666-16675},
  abstract={The purpose is to solve the security problems of the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (CITS) Digital Twins (DTs) in the Deep Learning (DL) environment. The DL algorithm is improved; the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is combined with Support Vector Regression (SVR); the DTs technology is introduced. Eventually, a CITS DTs model is constructed based on CNN-SVR, whose security performance and effect are analyzed through simulation experiments. Compared with other algorithms, the security prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 90.43%. Besides, the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms regarding Precision, Recall, and F1. The data transmission performances of the proposed algorithm and other algorithms are compared. The proposed algorithm can ensure that emergency messages can be responded to in time, with a delay of less than 1.8s. Meanwhile, it can better adapt to the road environment, maintain high data transmission speed, and provide reasonable path planning for vehicles so that vehicles can reach their destinations faster. The impacts of different factors on the transportation network are analyzed further. Results suggest that under path guidance, as the Market Penetration Rate (MPR), Following Rate (FR), and Congestion Level (CL) increase, the guidance strategy’s effects become more apparent. When MPR ranges between 40% ~ 80% and the congestion is level III, the ATT decreases the fastest, and the improvement effect of the guidance strategy is more apparent. The proposed DL algorithm model can lower the data transmission delay of the system, increase the prediction accuracy, and reasonably changes the paths to suppress the sprawl of traffic congestions, providing an experimental reference for developing and improving urban transportation.},

The aim of Smart farming is to extract information from agricultural entities to resolve issues and challenges faced with regard to rising demand, food security, and climate change. Digital Twin is a concept that has the potential to increase production and efficiency while reducing the use of energy and other materials. The potential for digital twins to succeed in sustainable agriculture is enormous. Since the agriculture sector is dynamic and complicated, it needs an advanced management system. The necessity for automatic and self-reliant agriculture set up at the initial level is critical due to the frequent occurrence of natural disasters like floods and diseases. Due to problems with soil-based systems such as erosion, heavy manual labor, water availability, and productivity issues, soilless agriculture is becoming more and more popular.

  abstract={Driven by digital twin (DT) technology, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expanding to open up new frontiers in industrial applications. However, traditional DT modeling approaches require synchronizing massive amounts of data, resulting in high communications overhead and privacy vulnerability. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel DT architecture for IIoT, where the DT can showcase the real-time operating status of the industrial environment. Swarm learning (SL) is an emerging decentralized federated learning (FL) technique that eliminates the need of a centralized server. We present a novel credibility-weighted SL scheme to construct the DT models, which improves data security while ensuring the fairness of participants as opposed to conventional FL. In addition, we develop a DT-assisted deep reinforcement learning algorithm for simultaneously optimizing the system reliability and energy consumption of IIoT. Simulation comparisons demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms some state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of both reliability and energy consumption.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1488-1495},
  abstract={Aspect term extraction is a vital sub-task of sentiment analysis, which aims to extract explicit product attributes in customer reviews. Unfortunately, many languages lack sufficient labeled data, so researchers focus on Cross-lingual Aspect Term Extraction (XATE) to fully use sufficient data in other languages. Most recent cross-lingual methods focus on semantic alignment and data augmentation, but lack research on language structure, including syntax and lexicality. To this end, we propose a Language-Agnostic framework with Bidirectional Syntactic Graph Convolutional Networks (LA-BSGCN) for XATE. It is based on the idea that the topological structures of syntactic dependencies and the lexical tags across different languages are similar. We design a multi-layer bidirectional GCN, which can encode the syntactic tree more accurately. Furthermore, to reduce the lexicality semantic gap between different languages, we encode named entity recognition (NER) and part of speech (POS) information into our model. We conduct six pairs of cross-lingual experiments on SemEval2016 Task5 datasets. The results show that our LA-BSGCN significantly reduces the semantic gap and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. For reproducibility, our code for this paper is available at github.},

  abstract={The attack graph model is an effective method for analyzing multi-step attacks. Most existing related works only focus on networks with static topology and are unsuitable for the satellite Internet, whose backbone network periodically changes in topology. They are inefficient in path retrieval and unreasonable in attack path inference. To improve the retrieval efficiency of attack paths, we first propose a network logical attack graph with periodic changes. It can reduce retrieval space while preserving the exploitation relationship among hosts in a period. Then we design a hierarchical parallel search algorithm to quickly retrieve attack paths by dividing the path retrieval space into independent subspaces that can compute in parallel. To reasonably infer the attack paths, considering the impact of attack moment and topological connection duration on the selection probability of the attack path, we calculate it in combination with the basic exploitability probability, the total attack duration intention, the asset value, the time-based PageRank centrality, and the attack completion ratio. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

We present an attack space for DT-based CPS on four layers (i.e., object layer, communication layer, DT layer, and application layer), three attack objects (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability), and attack types combined with strength and knowledge. Furthermore, some selected case studies are conducted to examine attacks on representative DT-based CPS (smart grid, smart transportation, and smart manufacturing).

  abstract={The thermal modeling of a press pack insulated gate bipolar transistor (PP-IGBT) is crucial for device reliability estimation and operation management. However, the traditional finite element model (FEM) cannot simulate the temperature of a PP-IGBT device in real time, resulting in lifetime evaluation delays and errors. Therefore, this article proposes a thermal twin (TT) modeling method of a PP-IGBT based on power loss. First, common PP-IGBT TT modeling based on the reduced-order model (ROM) technology is introduced, and an optimized PP-IGBT TT modeling method based on power loss is proposed and compared with the common TT modeling method. Second, the electro-thermal coupling PP-IGBT FEM is determined, and the optimized PP-IGBT TT and a digital interface based on FEM simulation results are established and analyzed. Finally, the digital twin (DT) interaction system of the PP-IGBT is established, and the accuracy of the proposed TT model is verified via infrared experiments. The results reveal that the proposed PP-IGBT TT realizes the real-time and comprehensive mapping of the device temperature, and has great applicability potential in temperature monitoring and reliability evaluation.},

  abstract={Currently, cloud computing and big data are largely applied in smart construction, or so-called industrial Internet of Things 4.0. Building Information Model (BIM) performs as an elemental information and data unit, which is extensively employed in entire construction processes (lifespan) and inter-acted with various entities including investors, employers, design institutes, construction companies, and monitors. They thus can achieve quantitative computing, measurement, and managements by sharing BIM data. The accumulation of BIM data will finally approach to a big data for construction intelligence. However, sharing BIM big data may be subtle in terms of privacy leakage, since BIM data may enclose the critical infrastructure information, homeland security data, structure parameters, and design intellectual property. It thus is of urgent importance to protect privacy in the BIM data sharing. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based method to protect data privacy in BIM data sharing, which can be applied for guaranteeing the information security in next generation industrial Internet of Things for smart construction.},

  abstract={To better secure critical infrastructure, especially power systems, this paper introduces a virtual SCADA automation controller. The automation controller is a gateway into a power subsystem, making it a valuable target for cyber-attacks that could cut it off from the control center and cause a loss of view and control. To prevent this, the Virtual Automation Controller (VAC) is a backup device that mirrors the capabilities of the physical controller. It can communicate via Modbus and DNP3 and is containerized so it can be deployed on a variety of platforms. Furthermore, it utilizes software-defined networking to quickly disconnect a failed automation controller and preserve its state for forensics. The VAC gives system operators time to replace the failed controller and prevents dangerous and costly damage to power systems. The VAC is compared against the SEL 3505-3 RTAC and shown to have the necessary features to act as a failover controller.},

  abstract={Digital Twins represent a powerful tool for transforming production and logistics towards Industry 4.0. They mirror physical assets in the digital world, enriching them with additional capabilities and features such as decision-making or lifecycle management. Due to the diverse possibilities associated with the Digital Twin, their design and implementation are also wide-ranging. This paper aims to contribute to the formalization and standardization of the description of Digital Twins. It presents a method for evaluating them through their lifecycle, from design to operation. The paper is based on an overview of their potential functionalities and properties with ranked stages of development. This method allows for an application-specific evaluation of Digital Twins and describes how they can be improved to suit the application better. The maturity model development follows the procedure for developing maturity models for IT management. Relevant capabilities and features were identified with a systematic literature review following the PRISMA guidelines. The results of this review were ranked and categorized and constitute the core of the maturity model, which was validated on five use-cases from different domains in production and logistics. The maturity model assesses Digita Twins in seven categories (context, data, computing capabilities, model, integration, control, human-machine interface) with 31 ranked characteristics. It evaluates existing solutions for potential improvements for a given application or the transfer to a new use-case. The resulting method and a supplementary web service present a generalized model for the evaluation of Digital Twins. Based on a description of a potential application, this is the first step towards a systematic evaluation, improving the structured development of such applications},

  abstract={Throughout its existence, humanity has been experiencing the spread of outbreaks. Outbreaks were recognized as epidemics spread over a wide international geographical area. It afflicts a large part of the world's inhabitants and leads to major imbalances due to social and environmental changes during history. The world has experienced several pandemics such as Ebola, Plague, Influenza and today COVID 19 or SARS -COV 2. Corona Virus ID 19 or COVID 19 is a mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS virus which appeared in China in 2003. It is a virus that is transmissible to humans and basically attacks human respiratory system, causing respiratory complications that can lead in some critical cases to the death of the affected patient. In a world that is undergoing major climate changes, and that is increasingly globalized and open, the risk of pandemic is persistent, as well as the chances of facing it. Today, science and technology are experiencing their peak of development thanks to the expansion of digital transformation in all sectors and the implementation of major concepts of the fourth industrial revolution such as internet of things and cyber physical systems. Autonomy, intelligence, interoperability, flexibility and portability are among the slogans of the new digital revolution but may also be in the future years key weapons to face the spread of such global health crises. This paper aims at highlighting the major role played by digitalization and more particularly virtual replicas of real systems referred to as digital twin systems to counter the spread of covid 19 and reduce its socio-economic and industrial consequences.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={The dynamic monitoring of the temperature distribution of power equipment is crucial for safe operation. The monitoring method based on digital twin technology has received extensive attention due to its ability to provide more timely and more comprehensive analysis. However, the existing methods only use physics-driven or data-driven methods separately, which cannot simultaneously meet application requirements such as low cost, high efficiency, effective results, and sufficient training data. Therefore, a new dynamic monitoring method of temperature distribution based on thermal knowledge and conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed in this article, with a high-voltage cable joint taken as an example. First, the steady-state numerical model of the temperature field is established. The thermal image set under different operation conditions is obtained through simulation. The data-driven method based on the CGAN model is applied to learn the data laws between operation conditions and thermal images and constructs a mapping relationship between them. Then, the physics-driven method based on thermal knowledge is used to reduce feature dimensions and extract input features from real-time measurement data. These input features drive the generator of the CGAN model to generate the thermal images dynamically. By comparing the generation results with numerical and experimental results, the proposed method can achieve the dynamic monitoring of temperature for cable joints, which has comprehensive advantages with regard to the time efficiency, computational cost, monitoring accuracy, and generalization ability. It provides new insights into the digital twin technology of power equipment.},

  abstract={The growing use of multimedia applications in digital health (eHealth) has highlighted the need for secure communication protocols to protect sensitive patient data. Security is expected as a crucial requirement also of future sixth-generation (6G) networks, which represent a valuable means to favor the definitive development of eHealth, hitherto hindered by the insufficient adequacy of technologies. In particular, device-to-device (D2D) has already emerged in previous generations of cellular networks as a promising solution to enable fast and reliable data exchange between devices, and it is expected to be an enabling technology of forthcoming 6G networks as well. However, the security of D2D communication in eHealth is a major concern due to the possibility of unauthorized access and data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an authentication protocol to secure D2D communications established to support the development of eHealth multimedia applications in 6G-oriented networks. The conducted performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in achieving secure and reliable D2D communications and shows the benefits offered by the proposed solution in terms of energy savings.},

The study documents the complete journey of the design of this intervention from training and onboarding participants, to customizing simulation parameters, and observing/polling participation for acceptance/reactions. The design and analysis come from both the perspectives of a veteran MUN facilitator seeking best practices and an educational technologist looking for design principles. The study analyzes the perspectives from the participants and facilitators to find hints at best practices and design principles for MUN simulations in VR. The findings show the need for iteration or re-design of activities from those of more traditional MUN facilitation such as face-to-face or teleconference to align with what VLEs can offer.},

  abstract={Critical infrastructure (CI), such as energy and water distribution systems, is essential for the stability and well-being of the modern society. Industrial automation and control systems (IACSs) form the backbone of CIs and enable the operation of such systems in a safe and reliable manner. However, with the increasing use of industrial Ethernet communication protocols, such as Modbus-over-TCP (Modbus/TCP), once air-gapped IACSs are becoming vulnerable to potential cybersecurity threats. This paper presents a novel method for enhancing the cybersecurity of Modbus/TCP-based IACSs by implementing an authentication method based on message authentication codes (MACs). To provide partial protection of communication even when communicating with legacy Modbus/TCP peers, we propose a novel supervising device that analyzes exchanged messages and verifies the authenticity of the protected messages. To experimentally verify the protection method, a water-treatment cyber-physical system (CPS) was implemented as a digital twin in a programmable logic controller (PLC). The underlying MAC is the Chaskey-12, lightweight MAC defined in IEC 29192-6. It was implemented in the PLC program using the programming languages defined in IEC 61131-3. As an additional contribution, the presented implementation allows protection of communication between PLCs and other Modbus/TCP peers installed in existing IACSs without hardware or firmware modifications. The results show that the method provides protection against network attacks without significantly affecting performance, also demonstrating the feasibility of such protection in IACSs.},

Web of Science, Scopus, and a set of specific keywords were used to select peer-reviewed papers presenting evidence of the considered connections. Selected clusters and topics were used to build a reference framework formed by relations between CI and I4.0. The results revealed that despite the popularity of both issues, studies examining the mutual relations between the same are lacking. The added value of the article is that it organizes the knowledge related to relations between I4.0 and CI, and indicates the research areas that require further scrutiny. It is the first comprehensive literature review focusing specifically on CI & I4.0.},

  abstract={Data mining outsourcing solutions have received much attention as an effective technique to obtain potentially useful information from massive data. However, privacy issues have become a major impediment to outsourcing data mining. In this paper, we try to guarantee data privacy in outsourcing Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP). To achieve this goal, a secure and efficient ISOMAP outsourcing framework is proposed, which understands the underlying information while protecting the data. Specifically, the neighbor relationships in the low-dimensional space of ISOMAP are the same as the original data. And for classification and clustering downstream tasks, the accuracy of the model built on our framework is almost the same as that of the ISOMAP model based on centralized explicit data. In addition, the proposed framework can achieve almost the same performance as the original data, and customers can gain significant computational savings in efficiency from outsourcing.

  abstract={With the widespread adoption of IoT, smart homes have gradually permeated our daily lives. However, most of this data is held by the data platform company. Platform companies sometimes leak data and sometimes discontinue unprofitable services. Concurrently, device compatibility, personal data security, and fragmentation problems are also becoming increasingly serious. In this study, we developed the Ubi-House system that integrates social and IoT data to provide users with personalized smart home management. The system adheres to a “Human-centric” principle, allowing users to manage their own smart home data and social network data. Through an authorization management feature, users can autonomously decide who to share their data with and to what extent. We advocate for the use of the ActivityPub protocol, which is widely used in decentralized social networks, as the communication protocol for smart homes. This facilitates centralized management of a user's smart home data and social network data. We have attempted to convert the communication protocols of existing smart home devices to the ActivityPub protocol, aiming to achieve interoperability among IoT devices from various companies. Our research addresses the fragmentation issue of smart home data. With the Ubi-House system, users can better control their data and ensure personal data security. Upon user authorization, third-party applications can assist users in understanding their usage habits, environmental conditions, and more, enhancing their comprehension of their own data. The comprehensive data collected by the Ubi-House system can be utilized with digital twin technology to construct virtual user behaviors, forecast device usage, gain a more accurate understanding of user needs, and deliver personalized services.},

  abstract={Innovative solutions are required to sustain the balance between energy generation and demand to achieve the desired efficiency in the power system and microgrid. With the recent advances in information and communication technologies that provide energy solution services based on big data analytics, machine learning (ML), and IoT technologies, the concept of digital twins (DT) has been introduced as a constructible active model to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. The DT is a reliable and economic microgrid technology considering its advantages of virtual real-time simulation, physical-based control, and constant monitoring. Moreover, DTs can predict future performance, energy consumers' behaviour, and a complex system's maintenance. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for adapting the DT into applying a microgrid that interacts with the control system to ensure its information security and proper operation. Unlike other DT frameworks in the literature, the proposed for the local energy community. The framework was tested on a distributed network system. The implementation test concluded that the TalTech DT system is applicable for developing and validating power system applications.},

  abstract={With the advancement in computing power and speed, the Internet is being transformed from screen-based information to immersive and extremely low latency communication environments in web 3.0 and the Metaverse. With the emergence of the Metaverse technology, more stringent demands are required in terms of connectivity such as secure access and data privacy. Future technologies such as 6G, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can mitigate some of these challenges. The Metaverse is now on the verge where security and privacy concerns are crucial for the successful adaptation of such disruptive technology. The Metaverse and web 3.0 are to be decentralized, anonymous, and interoperable. Metaverse is the virtual world of Digital Twins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).The control and possession of users’ data on centralized servers are the cause of numerous security and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a solution for the security and interoperability challenges using Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) integrated with blockchain. The philosophy of Self-Sovereign Identity, where the users are the only holders and owners of their identity, comes in handy to solve the questions of decentralization, trust, and interoperability in the Metaverse. This work also discusses the vision of a single, open standard, trustworthy, and interoperable Metaverse with initial design and implementation of SSI concepts.},

  abstract={With the rapid growth of online applications and the increasing complexity of network architecture, network security faces significant challenges. As a promising approach, the network digital twin brings fresh opportunities for building more trustworthy networks. In this article, we analyze the challenges faced when designing cybersecurity twins and the methodology to address them. Then, the autonomous trusted network (ATN) framework is proposed, which leverages network digital twins, to enhance network security. The ATN framework incorporates flexible data aggregation, a security twin model, and an intelligent configuration model. It collects critical network data, trains security twin models using graph neural networks (GNNs), and generates intelligent configuration policies for proactive defense. By integrating network digital twins, advanced AI technologies, and programmable data planes, the ATN framework enables proactive threat detection, real-time response, and optimization, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of networks in the face of evolving security challenges. The effectiveness of the ATN framework is demonstrated through a case study on Link-Flooding Attacks (LFA). The ATN framework effectively predicts and mitigates LFA by limiting attack traffic while ensuring the uninterrupted flow of legitimate traffic. The results show that the ATN framework outperforms traditional mitigation methods, such as traffic filtering and rerouting, in terms of promptness and efficiency.},

  abstract={In the realm of intelligent highways, vast amounts of data are generated from the activities involving with road design, construction, and management. These data require comprehensive collection, organization, and reconfiguration in order to form standardized and cohesive datasets that can be classified and graded for applications in intelligent scenarios, such as advanced driver assistance and intelligent road maintenance. The objective of this paper is to build a dataset that is replete with professional and detailed information for the applications of intelligent highway scenarios. For this purpose, an unified data resource directory is established, and highway data are classified through digital processing of various road engineering periods, including survey, design, construction, and maintenance. In the directory, each data element is accompanied by detailed information, including the name, source, content, format, etc. This information is more detailed and comprehensive than that of other existing information resource standards. Furthermore, a new type of data called “virtual space-time information” has been investigated and gathered. This type of data is specific originating from intelligent highway technical scenarios and is used to combine the dynamic and static data generated from massive traffic infrastructures and traffic operation status. By leveraging artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, and other technologies to simulate highway information, the data resource can ultimately serve as the foundation for various application scenarios such as construction supervision, maintenance analysis, and decision-making. Based on the aforementioned work, a method for classifying data into detailed categories has been devised, enabling different types of highway data to be categorized into groups and form an unified data resource. This resource can serve as a foundation and crucial support for intelligent highways.},

  abstract={The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and overall scheme for the use and management of building information modeling (BIM) in the whole building life cycle, especially the use of BIM technology for asset management and facility management. However, there is little understanding and implementation of enterprise BIM. BIM influences and changes the new project management mode of the whole life cycle of construction projects from design to construction. The safety, audit, responsibility and value of BIM are the forward-looking problems in current BIM, but it is difficult to realize the whole process value management based on the contribution of all parties, it is not conducive to the popularization and application of BIM. From the perspective of new technology and the whole life cycle, this paper analyzes the development and promotion of Blockchain technology to construction projects, and puts forward the fusion point of BIM and Blockchain technology: multi-user, multi-stage, multi-target data fusion and traceability mechanism; It is a consensus process model of multi-party collaboration, interest balance, non-destructive transmission of building information, responsibility traceability and customer satisfaction. It realizes the supporting framework and implementation ideas of BIM and Blockchain technology in construction projects from the aspects of design technology, construction management, material scheduling and whole life cycle construction.

  abstract={Smart contracts in the Blockchain were initially applied in the financial services domain and later, incorporated into the Internet of Things (IoT) networks because the Blockchain can complement the IoT networks by boosting the benefits through the modularity of the network and peer-to-peer connections. In this paper, we aim to address the issue that prevents the widespread adoption of Blockchain technology in the IoT network, and more specifically, we want to address the case where there is no need for all the IoT devices to communicate with each other. Such cases can be related to smart grids, smart homes and smart cities, and also, smart vehicles to a lesser extent. All of these cases mostly have a central authority, which requires a means to communicate with its clients securely. Our proposed solution makes use of a hierarchical approach to the Blockchain on the IoT network so that we can control the size of the ledger that each sub-network would require. Our solution makes use of Hyperledger Fabric, which is a free and open-source Blockchain framework and helps resolve the ledger size, and cost issues that plague many of the existing solutions in the literature without compromising on the main benefits of the Blockchain. As such, the proposed model enhances the integrity, authorization, and authentication of the communication between the IoT devices in the network. With this in mind, the metaverse requires IoT devices like sensors to interact with the real world. Hence the need to securely manage the sensor swarm is of high importance.},

  abstract={A large amount of hateful speech exist on the Internet in the form of text and images uploaded by social media users. Recently, multimodal hateful speech detection task has attracted more and more researchers to invest, producing some representative work for perceiving the negative samples. For this special multimodal task, the ability of multimodal semantic information understanding is particularly crucial. However, the existing models have insufficient understanding ability of image modality semantic compared with the text modality, due to the appearance complexity of each image. Therefore, this paper utilizes the text modality which is well understood by the model to improve understanding ability of image modality semantic. Specifically, this paper proposes an image caption supervision (ICS) auxiliary method for multimodal hateful speech detection, where the image caption is designed to supervise the feature learning of images for further understanding the semantic information. On the Facebook Hateful Memes dataset, the proposed ICS method outperforms some state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of ICS.},

In the real-world scenarios, designing efficient and lightweight acquisition methods is an urgent need. However, previous research are too inefficient and bulky. In this paper, we propose DeepSA, a system based on laser speckle technology and a lightweight convolutional neural network to acquire speech signals remotely. First, DeepSA acquires speckle images using laser speckle technology. Second, DeepSA extracts speech signals via a lightweight convolutional neural network that utilizes depthwise separable convolution modules. Experimental results show that DeepSA is more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art work on a dataset of 150k entries. Furthermore, since the speckle pattern is an optical effect on the surface of the object, we explore the effect of different objects and sampling rates on speech acquisition. To conclude, the proposed method has the advantages of being lightweight and efficient and has the potential to be deployed on mobile terminals, which proves that it is an important development in the field of remote speech acquisition.},

However, training models in a cross-silo manner is still challenging when considering data privacy. In order to tackle these challenges, a personalized cross-silo federated learning mechanism named federated global partners searching (FedGPS) is proposed. Firstly, model parameters for the participating clients are encrypted and uploaded to the central server as input. Next, FedGPS automatically determines the collaboration degrees between clients based on data distribution. After that, personalized model updates are sent back to the clients. Finally, each client conducts local updating after data decryption. The effectiveness of the FedGPS is verified in real-world cases and our method achieves 92.35% Accuracy, 98.55% Precision, 92.90% Recall, and 95.27% F1-Score comparing with other existing models from the literature.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) has brought new promises of efficiency in our daily lives by integrating AI with the IoT. However, owing to limited resources (e.g., computational power), it is difficult to implement modern technology (e.g., AI) and improve its performance (i.e., the IoT). Moreover, cyberthreats and privacy challenges can hinder the success of the IoT. This situation is aggravated by network scarcity (i.e., limited network connectivity). This article presents a digital twin-based data aggregation scheme in which data are collected using federated learning by operating a drone and stored securely in the blockchain. Before data sharing, differential privacy is realized to enhance privacy. A multirole training scheme is proposed, along with a duplex model verification architecture using a Hampel filter and performance check. To validate the specifications, an authentication scheme was implemented by combining a cuckoo filter and timeframe check. A case study to construct an experimental environment using real hardware is discussed. Different experiments were conducted in this environment and the feasibility of the proposed scheme was validated from the outcomes.},

  abstract={Semiconductor manufacturing, particularly wafer fabrication, is a highly complex system of processes and workflows. Fabrication facilities must deal with re-entrant flows to support multiple types of wafers being produced simultaneously, each with their own deadlines and specifications. The manufacturing process itself depends upon the ability to control and programmatically adjust a variety of environmental conditions. In addition, wafer fabrication consumes large amounts of energy, particularly electricity. Emerging technologies including networked devices may help reduce the energy footprint but can introduce cybersecurity risks. Therefore, this paper presents its modeling and simulation framework to quantify tradeoffs between operational measures of performance, energy consumption, and cybersecurity risks.

  abstract={The blockchain system requires every node to preserve a complete copy of data arbitrarily, which exerts tremendous storage pressure on nodes. Some researchers applied the erasure code to reduce storage redundancy. However, code storage schemes have the problem of inefficient data communication while verifying transactions and downloading data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a lightweight locally repairable code (LRC) storage scheme inspired by the idea of slice strategy from privacy computing. Firstly, partitioning each block into distinct transaction slices substantially reduces the amount of transmitted data required to verify a transaction. Secondly, our scheme can recover single-point data with fewer code data slices by local nodes and with less network communication overhead. At last, we analyze the performance of our scheme from theoretical perspectives and examine the storage performance and computation efficiency of our scheme from experimental perspectives. Results suggest that our scheme can effectively reduce the storage overhead while also decreasing the network communication overhead and improving the data reading efficiency.},

  year={2020},
  volume={58},
  number={2},
  pages={35-41},
  abstract={Due to the fast pace at which IoT is evolving, there is an increasing need to support over-theair software updates for security updates, bug fixes, and software extensions. To this end, multiple over-the-air techniques have been proposed, each covering a specific aspect of the update process, such as (partial) code updates, data dissemination, and security. However, each technique introduces overhead, especially in terms of energy consumption, thereby impacting the operational lifetime of the battery constrained devices. Until now, a comprehensive overview describing the different update steps and quantifying the impact of each step is missing in the scientific literature, making it hard to assess the overall feasibility of an over-the-air update. To remedy this, our article analyzes which parts of an IoT operating system are most updated after device deployment, proposes a step-by-step approach to integrate software updates in IoT solutions, and quantifies the energy cost of each of the involved steps. The results show that besides the obvious dissemination cost, other phases such as security also introduce a significant overhead. For instance, a typical firmware update requires 135.026 mJ, of which the main portions are data dissemination (63.11 percent) and encryption (5.29 percent). However, when modular updates are used instead, the energy cost (e.g., for a MAC update) is reduced to 26.743 mJ (48.69 percent for data dissemination and 26.47 percent for encryption).},

  abstract={Controller Area Network (CAN) is a masterless serial bus designed and widely used for the exchange of mission and time-critical information within commercial vehicles. In-vehicle communication is based on messages sent and received by Electronic Control Units (ECUs) connected to this serial bus network. Although unencrypted, CAN messages are not easy to interpret. In fact, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) attempt to achieve security through obscurity by encoding the data in their proprietary format, which is kept secret from the general public. As a result, the only way to obtain clear data is to reverse engineer CAN messages. Driven by the need for in-vehicle message interpretation, which is highly valuable in the automotive industry, researchers and companies have been working to make this process automated, fast, and standardized. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art and summarize the major advances in CAN bus reverse engineering. We are the first to provide a taxonomy of CAN tokenization and translation techniques. Based on the reviewed literature, we highlight an important issue: the lack of a public and standardized dataset for the quantitative evaluation of translation algorithms. In response, we define a complete set of requirements for standardizing the data collection process. We also investigate the risks associated with the automation of CAN reverse engineering, in particular with respect to the security network and the safety and privacy of drivers and passengers. Finally, we discuss future research directions in CAN reverse engineering.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence-powered automotive electronics has revolutionized teleoperated vehicles through the adoption of Augmented Reality of Things (ARoT). This transformation is facilitated by Augmented Reality-based Heads-Up Displays (AR-HUDs) connected to vehicle sensors, which improve driver visibility with immersive overlays, taking in-vehicle human-computer interaction to new heights. These developments include Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) that aid drivers whether they are physically present in the vehicle or remotely controlling it. However, integrating ARoT and ADAS raises security and privacy concerns, especially regarding false data injection attacks. This paper analyzes security vulnerabilities in AR-HUDs, focusing on forged frames in shared AR-HUD video between teleoperated vehicles and their Digital Twins (DT). Critical vulnerabilities are identified through DT, necessitating effective mitigation for Metaverse access. In addition, the proposed solution is a decentralized data security framework based on multiple blockchains, overcoming latency and scalability issues with a Multichain scaffold. Furthermore, the ARoT heavily relies on a deep neural network for computer vision-based obstacle detection, with the results displayed on the AR-HUD. This helps secure the entire ARoT ecosystem, ensuring the integrity and safety of teleoperated vehicles.},

  abstract={As the effects of climate change are becoming more and more evident, the importance of improved situation awareness is also gaining more attention, both in the context of preventive environmental monitoring and in the context of acute crisis response. One important aspect of situation awareness is the correct and thorough monitoring of air pollutants. The monitoring is threatened by sensor faults, power or network failures, or other hazards leading to missing or incorrect data transmission. For this reason, in this work we propose two complementary approaches for predicting missing sensor data and a combined technique for detecting outliers. The proposed solution can enhance the performance of low-cost sensor systems, closing the gap of missing measurements due to network unavailability, detecting drift and outliers thus paving the way to its use as an alert system for reportable events. The techniques have been deployed and tested also in a low power microcontroller environment, verifying the suitability of such a computing power to perform the inference locally, leading the way to an edge implementation of a virtual sensor digital twin.},

CTwin is an end-to-end web-based platform that incorporates various aspects of the decision-making process for optimizing urban transportation systems in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to reduce traffic congestion, incidents, and vehicle fuel consumption. The platform serves as a cyberinfrastructure to collect and integrate multi-domain urban mobility data from various online repositories and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, covering multiple urban aspects (e.g., traffic, natural hazards, weather, and safety) that are relevant to urban mobility management. The platform enables advanced capabilities for: (a) real-time situational awareness on traffic and infrastructure conditions on highways and urban roads, (b) cyber-physical control for optimizing traffic signal timing, and (c) interactive visual analytics on big urban mobility data and various metrics for traffic prediction and transportation performance evaluation. The platform is designed using a multi-level componentization paradigm and is implemented using modular and adaptive architecture, rendering it as a generalizable and extendable prototype for other urban management applications.

  abstract={The vehicular metaverse is expected to provide a widely connected virtual Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where extended reality (XR) is one of the critical infrastructures. However, the combination of XR and automated vehicle (AV) networks brings several significant challenges, e.g., low-latency XR panoramic video transmission, high bandwidth, and the high mobility of vehicles. This article introduces digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered panoramic video streaming for XR-assisted connected AVs to reduce transmission latency and intelligently respond to user requirements. Specifically, we propose a DT-enabled distributed XR service management framework to provide low-latency and smooth XR services across different domains in the vehicular metaverse. In addition, we present a case study on XR streaming-based virtualized resource allocation and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method to minimize transmission latency. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the positive role of AI in connected AV networks can be enhanced by DTs. Finally, open issues and potential research directions for the XR-assisted vehicular metaverse are discussed.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 represents the fourth industrial revolution that will leverage the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to introduce adaptive and autonomous systems that can self-heal and self-learn. IIoT aims to promote businesses and industries by realizing intelligent industrialization. However, the constantly surging data volumes that are generated by IIoT environments present security issues like data integrity and system scalability. Blockchain is a promising candidate to address these problems, which offers distributed system design principles. Though blockchain-based IIoT frameworks may have the potential to support the demands and services of next-generation industrial systems, their integration is still constrained by significant challenges in scalability and security. Therefore, blockchain in its original structure with traditional proof-of-work consensus is not suitable for IIoT. To address this, we propose a blockchain architecture that uses a dynamic proof-of-work consensus with a block checkpoint mechanism. The dynamic consensus functions with different mining difficulty levels allow the architecture to efficiently scale with increase in communication traffic of IIoT devices, whereas the checkpoint defines an alternative mechanism to generate the next block hash in the blockchain. To study the scalability and feasibility of the architecture, thorough performance and security analyses are presented, which attest that it can scale and offer enhanced security fidelity with a minimal increase in block mining time.},

  abstract={In the context of the “dual carbon” national strategy, the digitalization of security systems in all walks of life is an inevitable trend. As the core field of distributed new energy under the dual carbon policy, the safe access of wind and solar storage and distribution grid and emergency response are recognized as important research topics. The randomness, volatility, intermittency of photovoltaic wind power and the input of a large number of energy storage plants with two-way power flow into the distribution network lead to the transformation of the distribution network from the traditional power flow characteristics to the new distributed power flow characteristics, which further increases the complexity and variability of the load, and brings adverse effects to the safe operation of the distribution network. Therefore, energy storage systems are generally introduced to deal with the impact of the above new energy on the power grid. The energy storage system can realize multiple functions of absorption, frequency modulation and peak load cutting for renewable energy, and ensure the grid security of high proportion of new energy. Therefore, new energy storage power stations emerge as the times require. There are many challenges in the safe operation of the energy storage power station, such as the safe operation of the energy storage battery as the main energy storage carrier of the energy storage power station, and the safe operation of the wind turbine as the wind system. Behind the safety problems of these energy storage power plants are tens of thousands of related data monitoring, so it is necessary to sort out and monitor these data. Aiming at the above data monitoring of wind and solar integrated energy storage power station, this paper designs the monitoring system of wind and solar integrated energy storage power station, uses python language to write the main program, and uses the digital twin model to optimize the fault prediction module of the monitoring system. At the same time, the IEC60870-5 103 communication protocol introduced into the relay protection field is used to provide guarantee for the safe operation of the data exchange between the upper computer and the bottom layer.},

  abstract={The trilemma trade-off problem between decentralisation, scalability, and security states that in blockchain systems the above properties are negatively correlated. Infrastructure, node configuration, choice of Consensus Protocol, and complexity of the underlying application are cited among the factors that affect the balance of the trade-off. Given that Blockchains are complex, dynamic systems, a dynamic approach to their management and reconfiguration at runtime is deemed necessary to reflect the changes in the state of the infrastructure and application. This work proposes the use of Digital Twins as the means of optimising the trilemma trade-off of blockchain i.e., re-configuring system parameters such as to maximise scalability, decentralisation and security. Specifically, through a bi-directional feedback loop between the system and the digital twin, simulation, what-if analysis and machine learning techniques will be employed for the computation of an optimal configuration given the current system state. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is proposed to allow for blockchain reconfiguration without violating the decentralisation of the system.},

According to the test system, IV test tools mainly include virtual simulation testing, closed field testing, and open road testing, the three test tools have different focuses. Existing test methods and tools are either expensive or poor in test accuracy, they also have limitations such as difficult reuse of scenarios, Large test space requirements, etc. Digital-twin technology provide the possibility for the integration of multiple test tools.

The proposed prototype system includes a virtual scenario generation subsystem, a road simulation platform subsystem, and a monitoring & evaluation subsystem. The virtual scene generation subsystem can generate scenarios and transmit to the IV's perception devices; the road simulation platform shelf system is used to simulate the road conditions during the IV driving, and the monitoring & evaluation subsystem is used to monitor and evaluate the performance of the IV in real time.

  abstract={The emergence of the Metaverse promises to provide several benefits to society, e.g., fully immersive and interactive environments in health-care, the workplace, and everyday life. However, it introduces a number of privacy and security concerns, including identity, network, and economy-related threats, for both providers and users of Metaverse-based applications, which remain unaddressed. In this article, we high-light the potential role of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing within the Metaverse context as a promising opportunity to address such privacy and security issues. CTI refers to the relevant, timely and actionable information about the latest threats and attacks. In particular, we examine how organizations could proactively manage the cyber risks associated with their digital infrastructure by participating in CTI sharing within a Metaverse context. We also propose that user-based CTI sharing should be considered within the Metaverse given the potential prevalence of a number of user-specific threats, e.g., identity-related threats. Finally, we emphasise that the integration of user-based sharing creates additional threat sharing flows between users as well as between organizations and users that are lacking from existing CTI sharing approaches, e.g., user-to-user, organization-to-user, and user-to-organization.},

  abstract={The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their integration into a variety of vital sectors has created serious concerns regarding data protection, privacy, and resource management. As a promising model, edge computing has the ability to overcome these difficulties by putting the computing power closer to IoT devices. This article presents a novel approach for decentralized resource allocation in edge computing settings, with the goal of improving the security and efficiency of IoT systems. Edge nodes are critical in our proposed framework for managing and assigning computing resources to IoT devices, minimizing latency, and optimizing network traffic. The decentralization of resource distribution promotes resilience in the event of network outages or cyberattacks and provides robustness against single points of failure. We created a proof-of-importance (PoI) consensus mechanism for creating new blocks in the blockchain integrated edge-computing IoT devices. Therefore, the consensus mechanism will ensure the trust and security of IoT devices by authentication of each user in the network. We performed a series of experiments in a simulated edge-computing setting to assess the feasibility of our proposed method. We analyze the proposed system model based on the operation of three different file delivery and transactions. The simulation outcomes show that the blockchain system efficiently delivers the files and increases the transmission rate. We also compared our file delivery and transmission rate with existing techniques, and our proposed model provides a better result. Finally, we compared the power consumption of creating IoT nodes based on proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS), and PoI. The proposed PoI consensus mechanism consumes less power than the other two methods.},

  abstract={Configuring intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs) is significant for manufacturing enterprises to take a step toward Industry 4.0. However, most current IMS is configured based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with a centralized architecture, which results in poor flexibility to handle manufacturing disturbances and limits capacity to support security solutions. To solve the above issues, this article combines IIoT with the permissioned blockchain and proposes a novel manufacturing blockchain of things (MBCoT) architecture for the configuration of a secure, traceable, and decentralized IMS. Then, hardware infrastructures and software-defined components of MBCoT are designed to provide an insight into the industrial implementation of IMS. Furthermore, the consensus-oriented transaction logic of MBCoT is presented based on a crash fault-tolerant protocol, which empowers MBCoT with a strong but resource-efficient encryption mechanism to support the autonomous manufacturing process. Finally, the implementation of an MBCoT prototype system and its application examples justify that the proposed approach is practical and sound. The evaluation experiment demonstrates that MBCoT equips IMS with a secure, traceable, stable, and decentralized operating environment while achieving competitive throughput and latency performance.},

  abstract={This paper presents a concept for the application of behavioral simulations in the context of usage control for cyberphysical systems. The overall goal is to enable a separation of the usage control from a cyber-physical system, in order to handle the heterogeneity of these systems. According to the concept of behavior prediction based on digital twins, a behavior simulation of the system is used to realize a more detailed usage control. A central aspect of this is the provision of simulation data and results as well as enable usage control to control the simulation. To detail the concept, the roles and tasks of usage control and simulation are discussed to develop an architecture of a service to provide required simulation results. The concept is considered here in particular on the basis of cyber-physical systems in form of computer numerical controlled machines and virtual machining for the behavior simulation, but is also applicable to other kinds of simulations and not limited to the use case of an usage control. The detailing of the individual components depends on the type of simulation used and is therefore done specifically for virtual machining. Further the communication with the behavior simulation, the interfaces for the usage control are described. At least to verify the concept, a prototypical implementation of the simulation service and the integration into the usage control for a cyber-physical system is validated.},

  abstract={The rise of digital twins in the manufacturing industry is accompanied by new possibilities, like process automation and condition monitoring, real time simulations and quality and maintenance prediction are just a few advantages which can be realized. This paper takes a novel approach by extracting the fundamental knowledge of a data set from a production process and mapping it to an expert fuzzy rule set. Afterwards, new fundamental augmented data is generated by exploring the feature space of the previously generated fuzzy rule set. At the same time, a high number of artificial neural network (ANN) models with different hyperparameter configurations are created. The best models are chosen, in line with the idea of survival of the fittest, and improved with the additional training data sets, generated by the fuzzy rule simulation. It is shown that ANN models can be improved by adding fundamental knowledge represented by the discovered fuzzy rules. Those models can represent digitized machines as digital twins. The architecture and effectiveness of the digital twin is evaluated within an industry 4.0 use case.},

  pages={13474-13489},
  abstract={With the boom in advanced intelligent vehicles, the amount of data associated with the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) grows exponentially. Sharing road data among vehicles effectively can greatly improve their driving efficiency and road experience. This, however, is hindered by security concerns, bandwidth limitations, and mobility and communication distance between vehicles. In this article, we propose a citywide data sharing platform among vehicles based on the digital twin. Specifically, we propose a digital twin based vehicular platform on the cloud to facilitate the effective data sharing of vehicles. A digital twin is a digital representation of a vehicle on the cloud that synchronises data with the vehicle in real time. Therefore, data sharing among vehicles can be accomplished by their digital twins on the cloud without any physical limitations. Considering the data privacy of vehicles, a framework that combines federated learning and transfer learning is applied which can realise personalised data sharing among vehicles without disclosing their data privacy. An incentive mechanism based on the game-theoretic approach is devised to combat the mutual distrust between vehicles and encourage their contribution to data sharing. By sewing the above mechanisms, the proposed digital twin enabled data sharing platform can effectively address privacy, bandwidth limitation and incentive issues. Using extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

  pages={137577-137593},
  abstract={In the realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Digital Twins (DTs) have revolutionized the management of physical entities. However, existing implementations often face constraints due to hardware-centric approaches and limited flexibility. This article introduces a transformative paradigm that harnesses the potential of distributed digital twins as proxies, enabling software-centricity and unlocking composability and flexibility for purpose-oriented digital twin development and deployment. The proposed microservices-based architecture, rooted in service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices principles, emphasizes reusability, modularity, and scalability. Leveraging the Lean Digital Twin Methodology and packaged business capabilities expedites digital twin creation and deployment, facilitating dynamic responses to evolving industrial demands. This architecture segments the industrial realm into physical and virtual spaces, where core components are responsible for digital twin management, deployment, and secure interactions. By abstracting and virtualizing physical entities into individual digital twins, this approach lays the groundwork for purpose-oriented composite digital twin creation. Our key contributions involve a comprehensive exposition of the architecture, a practical proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation, and the application of the architecture in a use-case scenario. Additionally, we provide an analysis, including a quantitative evaluation of the proxy aspect and a qualitative comparison with traditional approaches. This assessment emphasizes key properties such as reusability, modularity, abstraction, discoverability, and security, transcending the limitations of contemporary industrial systems and enabling agile, adaptable digital proxies to meet modern industrial demands.},

  abstract={Improving data transfer efficiency is critical to reducing application completion time. Existing coflow scheduling schemes fail to take full advantage of the traffic characteristics in the network, especially in coflow scheduling where prior knowledge is unknown. This paper finds that making full use of flow characteristics can further reduce the coflow completion time. We propose a scheduling scheme A-SNCF based on traffic characteristics. Although A-SNCF lacks complete coflow information before transmission, A-SNCF can make reasonable scheduling based on the knowable information during transmission. The scheme proposed in this paper can schedule coflow according to traffic characteristics, which can further reduce the data transmission time. Experimental results on open source datasets show that the average completion time of A-SNCF is 20% less than that of MCS.},

To address the shortcomings and challenges of existing research work, we investigate the multi-source infection pattern mining algorithm for infectious dynamics in four-dimensional space-time. In this paper, the multi-source infection pattern (MSIP) model is first defined in four-dimensional spacetime. The proposed model considers elements that are more accurate to the real environment, including multi-source infection, movement trajectory, and spatio-temporal dimension. The infection pattern mining algorithm based on opportunity (MABO) is proposed under the MSIP model. The result of the experiment demonstrates that MABO performs effectively, which can mine more infected events under multi-source infection conditions.},

  abstract={Along with the development of virtual reality and augmented reality technology, the requirement for high fidelity face reenactment methods increases gradually. Recent face reenactment works either use landmarks or Action Units (AUs) based motion representation as the guided signal. However, it is difficult to represent the complex facial geometry and movement completely only with landmarks or AUs, which leads to the limited effect of these methods. To address this challenge, we propose a high fidelity face reenactment framework that combines landmarks and AUs together for facial motion representation. Specifically, we design a Motion Alignment Converter (MAC) module to align the landmarks and AUs when driving and source identities are different. After that, an Adaptive Motion Controller (AMC) module is proposed to inject motion information into the face reenactor. Moreover, to optimize output quality, the proposed method processes background and face regions separately. Qualitive and quantitative experiments are conducted on VoxCeleb1 and CelebV datasets, the results show that the proposed method can generate face images with more details and better background than existing methods.},

  abstract={With the widespread use of large artificial intelligence (AI) models such as ChatGPT, AI-generated content (AIGC) has garnered increasing attention and is leading a paradigm shift in content creation and knowledge representation. AIGC uses generative large AI algorithms to assist or replace humans in creating massive, high-quality, and human-like content at a faster pace and lower cost, based on user-provided prompts. Despite the recent significant progress in AIGC, security, privacy, ethical, and legal challenges still need to be addressed. This paper presents an in-depth survey of working principles, security and privacy threats, state-of-the-art solutions, and future challenges of the AIGC paradigm. Specifically, we first explore the enabling technologies, general architecture of AIGC, and discuss its working modes and key characteristics. Then, we investigate the taxonomy of security and privacy threats to AIGC and highlight the ethical and societal implications of GPT and AIGC technologies. Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art AIGC watermarking approaches for regulatable AIGC paradigms regarding the AIGC model and its produced content.

Existing literature posits several challenges for building DTs, as well as some proposals for overcoming them. However, in the vast majority of the cases, the architectures and technologies presented are strongly bounded to the domain where the DTs are applied. This article proposes the FIWARE Ecosystem, combining its catalog of components and smart data models as a solution for the development of any DT. We also provide a use case to show how to use FIWARE for building DTs through a complete example of a parking DT. We conclude that the FIWARE Ecosystem constitutes a real reference option for developing DTs in any domain.},

  abstract={The steady increase in energy demands has led to ever-increasing “energy generation.” This, coupled with the need for higher efficiency, flexibility, and reliability, has boosted the use of power electronics in power and energy systems. Therefore, power electronics-based energy conversion systems (PEECSs) have become prominent in power generation, power transmission, and end user applications. Given the relevance of such systems, and by considering their trend of digitalization, it is crucial to establish digital and intelligent PEECSs. To this end, digital twins (DTs) can be adopted, as they integrate many cutting-edge information techniques to realize the life cycle management of complex systems by constructing real-time mappings of them. In this article, existing DT techniques for PEECSs are reviewed. The concept, system layers, and key technologies of DTs are described first. Some application cases of DTs are then elaborated. Finally, future trends and challenges of DTs are discussed to provide a valuable reference for subsequent research.},

  abstract={Smart homes usually consist of smart objects (SOs) with limited resources and capabilities, and therefore constrain the complexity of applications that can be performed on them. In particular, updating smart objects within a smart home is a challenging undertaking, as seemingly insignificant updates affect the longevity of the deployment if they cause previously established dependencies to break. In this paper, we propose an architecture that we call Longevity Digital Twins (LDTs) as a strategic counterpart of SOs, aimed at running at the edge, as local to the smart home as possible. With this architecture, the capabilities of a SO can be virtually enhanced to support the software update process in the smart home. In this context, foresighted software management requires both a local capability to describe involved functionalities together with awareness about existing dependencies in this distributed system. Using a simulated smart home environment, we first measure the impact of conventional update strategies and then present the noticeable improvement that LDTs offer to this problem. Going further, we present the analysis of a real-world use case that showcases the potential of LDTs on how it could not only prevent the installation of breaking updates but also extend a SOs capabilities and its overall longevity.},

Low and medium grid voltage levels in particular have a pivotal role here, as a significant part of renewable energy feed-in, and almost any new volatile loads, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles, are connected on these levels. Thus far, especially on the low-voltage level, most grid operators encounter a lack of transparency and controllability. It is essential for the integration of renewable energies and volatile loads to have information on power flows and power quality. Hence, massive investments in grid, measurement, and telecontrol infrastructure would be necessary. Using intelligent software technology for grid management can significantly decrease these necessary investments.},

  abstract={Digital twin-aided (DT) edge computing is investigated, where users utilize grant-free random access with adaptive rate to offload their tasks to the edge server. A novel, with lower implementation complexity, probabilistic partial offloading scheme is introduced, while each device is assumed to have an infinite buffer to store its tasks. The aim of the proposed work is to minimize the average delay of the partial offloading. To that end, the average delay of waiting in the queue, the delay of offloading, and the local computation delay are extracted by using queuing theory tools. Then, the non-convex problem of minimizing the average delay of all clients is formulated, while taking into account DT imperfections. Successive convex approximation (SCA), alternating optimization (AO), and various algebraic manipulations are utilized to transform the problem into an equivalent convex problem with tractable solution. Finally, simulation results showcase the value of the proposed analysis and offer important insights for the proposed DT-aided edge network. Specifically, the proposed partial offloading scheme is shown to be more delay efficient compared to both local computing and full offloading, particularly, for greater task generation rates at the users. Also, the impact of the DT imperfections at the average delay is shown to be more notable as the number of users, or the tasks’ size, increases.},

The AV-TEP framework uses the safety case concept that is widely accepted in the AV industry and others, and consists of three pillars: (1) Safety Management System (SMS), (2) Design Methods, and (3) Scenario-Based Testing. The three pillars are described in detail, and the validation methodology used is outlined. Finally, the various paths to industry acceptance of the AV-TEP framework are described, which builds upon existing work and research wherever appropriate.},

  abstract={A critical requirement for robust, optimized, and secure design of vehicular systems is the ability to do system-level exploration, i.e., comprehend the interactions involved among electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, and communication interfaces in realizing system-level use cases and the impact of various design choices on these interactions. This must be done early in the system design to enable the designer to make optimal design choices without requiring a cost-prohibitive design overhaul. In this article, we develop a virtual prototyping environment for the modeling and simulation of vehicular systems. Our solution, ViVE, is modular and configurable, allowing the user to conveniently introduce new system-level use cases. Unlike other related simulation environments, our platform emphasizes coordination and communication among various vehicular components and just the abstraction of the necessary computation of each ECU. We discuss the ability of ViVE to explore the interactions between a number of realistic use cases in the automotive domain. We demonstrate the utility of the platform, in particular, to create real-time in-vehicle communication optimizers for various optimization targets. We also show how to use such a prototyping environment to explore vehicular security compromises. Furthermore, we showcase the experimental integration and validation of the platform with a hardware setup in a real-time scenario.},

  abstract={Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are vulnerable to malware, which is a key security risk for Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Existing attestation solutions are invasive because they require hardware security modules and software upgrades in legacy devices. We propose DNAttest, a Digital-twin-based Noninvasive Attestation solution to attest PLC behaviors in near-real time. DNAttest requires minimal ICS infrastructure changes and does not interfere with normal ICS operations. DNAttest detects PLC deviations by replicating all input messages for a PLC to its digital twin and comparing their output messages. Due to transient uncertainty in the PLC's internal processing state, DNAttest may output an incorrect comparison. To generate all plausible output values for comparison, we instantiate multiple emulated PLCs by replicating input messages with different timing profiles. We demonstrate on a close-to-real-world power grid testbed that DNAttest can provide a timely detection of a wide range of attacks non-invasively and accurately. DNAttest solution is lightweight and scalable. A typical desktop PC can attest more than 20 actual PLCs even if we use 10 emulators to monitor every actual PLC.},
