  abstract={As technology has advanced, people's lives have been transformed by the virtual world, which has been created by technologies such as the Internet, computers, artificial intelligence, and hardware. The metaverse, a new social ecology connecting the physical and virtual worlds, is rapidly expanding as the demand for virtual reality grows. Privacy, security, high synchronization, and low latency have all been challenged as data volumes and value have grown and the metaverse continues to evolve. As blockchain and intelligent networking technologies continue to evolve, these challenges can be addressed and the metaverse's needs for trusted construction, continuous data interaction, and computing can be satisfied. In order to provide immersive experiences in the metaverse, a comprehensive review of blockchain's role and benefits is essential. The purpose of this survey is to discuss the metaverse's development trend, architecture, and characteristics. This review paper is novel in providing an overview of existing blockchain research, including overviews, applications, and challenges. Furthermore, we summarized the metaverse's applications, emphasizing their significance and areas of development.

  pages={583-594},
  abstract={Background—Photo-realistic terapixel visualization is computationally intensive and to date there have been no such visualizations of urban digital twins, the few terapixel visualizations that exist have looked towards space rather than earth. Objective—Our aims are: creating a scalable cloud supercomputer software architecture for visualization; a photo-realistic terapixel 3D visualization of urban IoT data supporting daily updates; a rigorous evaluation of cloud supercomputing for our application. Method—We migrated the Blender Cycles path tracer to the public cloud within a new software framework designed to scale to petaFLOP performance. Results—We demonstrate that we can compute a terapixel visualization in under one hour, the system scaling at 98 percent efficiency to use 1024 public cloud GPU nodes delivering 14 petaFLOPS. The resulting terapixel image supports interactive browsing of the city and its data at a wide range of sensing scales. Conclusion—The GPU compute resource available in the cloud is greater than anything available on our national supercomputers providing access to the globally competitive resources. The direct financial cost of access, compared to procuring and running these systems, was low. The indirect cost, in overcoming teething issues with cloud software development, should reduce significantly over time.},

  pages={69160-69199},
  abstract={Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, to a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.},

  pages={522-527},
  abstract={The paper proposes a multi-agent approach to development of “digital twins” of plants, which reflects phases of plant development and allows for more accurate forecasting of harvest and planning of agrotechnical measures. It also shows the possibility to formalize domain knowledge on new agro technologies for plant growing and automate decision-making processes when introducing precision farming technologies. A formalized model of the digital twin of plants is proposed in the form of a multi-agent state machine, acting on the basis of a knowledge graph of transitions between phases of plant development. Each stage (state) has its own software agent, which helps respond to unforeseen events and recalculate predicted harvest and risks of problem situations. Recommendations developed by the digital twin are to be further sent to smart cyber-physical precision farming management system for adaptive rescheduling of resources and differentiated use of fertilizers and crop protection tools. The developed approach becomes valuable in growing uncertainty because of global climate changes, destroying agronomist domain knowledge collected over centuries.},

  abstract={The present work studies the storage security of edge-fog-cloud computing to improve cloud storage security. The data of an intelligent manufacturing industrial machine is used in the research and pre-processed. Machine manufacturing perception data includes data storage and data transmission. In addition, combined with the perception data of machine manufacturing, digital twins technology is used to construct the digital twin in the real world to simulate the online data-driven behavior of machine manufacturing. The digital twins model is built and saved by 3Dmax. Finally, deep learning technology is introduced to defend against network intrusion. Cloud databases are vulnerable to external attacks and internal attacks of cloud data providers. Thus, the homomorphic encryption algorithm and secure multi-party computing are introduced to ensure that the database stores ciphertext data and performs data queries directly. The experimental results indicate that digital twins technology has a good effect. The two-layer cloud database model costs US$11, 476.1, the lowest among comparative models. The unencrypted Amazon Relational Database Service has the best performance. The model proposed here also achieves relatively high availability, and the hybrid cloud structure significantly improves the model's performance. The research content provides a reference for realizing data storage security in a hybrid cloud.},

  pages={71624-71633},
  abstract={The use of a satellite Internet systems (SIS) makes it possible to effectively support technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This technology is especially relevant for oil and gas industry enterprises implementing the development of deposits located on the shelf of the Arctic Ocean. As the number of countries and companies engaged in the development of deposits in the Arctic Ocean increases, the number of groupings of low-orbit satellites increases as well. This can lead to a situation when an intruder satellite intercepts a control command and then imposes it on a receiver located on an unattended object. It is possible to reduce the effectiveness of such relay spoofing interference by using the satellite authentication protocol. The conducted studies have shown that authentication protocols with zero-knowledge proof have high cryptographic resistance to a satellite response being correctly picked up. However, they have a drawback. It is a significant time spent on determining the status of the satellite, which is caused by the fact that calculations are performed using a large module (128 or more digits). This disadvantage can be eliminated by using modular residue classes codes (MRCC).},

  abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a road transportation system that uses advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to realize dynamic real-time information interaction between people, vehicles and roads. As an indispensable part of the ITS, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has received extensive attention from many researchers. Since vehicles entering the range of RSU communication need to be authenticated. Therefore, in a high vehicle traffic flow environment, it is easily to form a computation or communication bottleneck at the RSU. To solve the above problems, some researchers have proposed many batch authentication protocols. However, on the one hand, Some proposed batch authentication protocols use computationally expensive bilinear pairing operations. On the other hand, some proposed protocols do not consider the existence of semi-trusted vehicle nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes a batch authentication protocol based on the small exponent test for IoV. In the protocol, the RSU will not send any authentication secret parameters to the proxy vehicle, thus eliminating the security risk of semi-trusted nodes leaking secret parameters. Meanwhile, the proposed protocol is based on the small exponent test method, which reduces the computation cost while ensuring security. Finally, the proposed protocol is proved to be secure by mathematical derivation, and the performance analysis results also show that the proposed protocol has lower communication cost.},

  abstract={With the development of globalization, business collaboration and exchanges between companies become increasingly frequent. Data communication between two or more parties using certificate authentication is a frequently employed security assurance approach that creates a substantial quantity of certificate data traffic. In the process of utilizing conventional certificates, it is possible to leak sensitive information of the corporation. For example, certificate data traffic in the smart grid may expose important nodes and current security management level of a certain grid-related network. Therefore, a solution is required to evaluate the data of the grid-related network at the certificate level in a secure and efficient manner. This study provides a certificate-based enterprise privacy analysis and anomaly detection scheme. Using SSL/TLS and X.509 as standards, the scheme extracts valid certificate information by collecting certificate data traffic between enterprise networks and analyzing the certificate data. The scheme monitors and analyzes the flow of certificate data for the grid network, identifies suspicious anomalous behaviors and invalid certificates, and warns of risky behavior. By monitoring certificate data flow, it is feasible to improve the enterprise authentication framework and business communication method, prevent the leaking of enterprise privacy data.},

Traditional vehicles are becoming more sophisticated with integrated driver-assist features incorporating AI algorithms, control systems, and communication interfaces. Modern vehicles are tightly-coupled into a system of systems more robust than the commonly leveraged physical world simulations used in the research community and industry today. This means that components beyond just the AI model effect the safety and security of operating vehicles. It is imperative to consider the complex and interconnected nature of these systems during pre-deployment development and testing. In this paper, we discuss our preliminary work on a multi-level simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testbed capable of evaluating vehicle reactions to diverse driving situations based on virtually constructed worlds. Our framework is able to evaluate vehicle behavior at scale in a simulated world while seamlessly integrating physical hardware via a digital-twin approach.},

One key industry that can benefit from the integration into the metaverse is healthcare. The potential to provide enhanced care for patients affected by multiple health issues, from standard afflictions to more specialized pathologies, is being explored through the fabrication of architectures that can support metaverse applications. In this paper, we focus on the persistent issues of lung cancer detection, monitoring, and treatment, to propose MetaLung, a privacy and integrity-preserving architecture on the metaverse. We discuss the use cases to enable remote patient-doctor interactions, patient constant monitoring, and remote care. By leveraging technologies such as digital twins, edge computing, explainable AI, IoT, and virtual/augmented reality, we propose how the system could provide better assistance to lung cancer patients and suggest individualized treatment plans to the doctors based on their information.

  abstract={Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), as the crucial support of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), have received great attention in recent years. With the rapid development of VANETs, various services have generated a great deal of data that can be used for transportation planning and safe driving. Especially, with the advent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transportation system has been impacted, thus novel modes of transportation planning and intelligent applications are necessary. Digital twins can provide powerful support for artificial intelligence applications in Transportation Big Data (TBD). The features of VANETs are varying, which arises the main challenge of digital twins applying in TBD. Network traffic prediction, as part of digital twins, is useful for network management and security in VANETs, such as network planning and anomaly detection. This paper proposes a network traffic prediction algorithm aiming at time-varying traffic flows with a large number of fluctuations. This algorithm combines Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for network traffic feature extraction. DQN is leveraged to carry out network traffic prediction, in which GAN is involved to represent Q-network. Meanwhile, the generative network can increase the number of samples to improve the prediction error. We evaluate the performance of our method by implementing it on three real network traffic data sets. Finally, we compare the two state-of-the-art competing methods with our method.},

  abstract={In the traditional Internet of Vehicles, communication data is easily tampered with and easily leaked. In order to improve the trust evaluation mechanism of the Internet of Vehicles and establish a trust relationship between vehicles, a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles trust evaluation (BBTE) scheme is proposed. First, the scheme uses the roadside unit RSU to calculate the trust value of vehicle nodes and maintain the generation, verification and storage of blocks, so as to realize distributed data storage and ensure that data cannot be tampered with. Secondly, an efficient trust evaluation method is designed. The method integrates four trust decision factors: initial trust, historical experience trust, recommendation trust and RSU observation trust to obtain the overall trust value of vehicle nodes. In addition, in the process of constructing the recommendation trust method, the recommendation trust is divided into three categories according to the interaction between the recommended vehicle node and the communicator, use CRITIC to obtain the optimal weights of three recommended trusts, and use CRITIC to obtain the optimal weights of four trust decision-making factors to obtain the final trust value. Finally, the NS3 simulation platform is used to verify the security and accuracy of the trust evaluation method, and to improve the identification accuracy and detection rate of malicious vehicle nodes. The experimental analysis shows that the scheme can effectively deal with the gray hole attack, slander attack and collusion attack of other vehicle nodes, improve the security of vehicle node communication interaction, and provide technical support for the basic application of Internet of Vehicles security.},

  abstract={Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in smart cities, especially in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the increasing reliance on technology in transportation systems, the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches increases, making IDS an important aspect of ITS security. IDS systems monitor network traffic and detect any suspicious or malicious activity. In the context of ITS, IDS can detect unauthorized access to transportation systems, unauthorized changes to data or configurations, and other types of security incidents. This information can then be used to alert security personnel and prevent potential threats from causing damage. Reinforcement Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (RL-IDS) have gained increasing attention in recent years as means of improving the performance of traditional intrusion detection systems. RL-IDS uses reinforcement learning algorithms to train an agent to detect intrusions by maximizing a reward signal. In this survey, we give an overview of the traditional intrusion detection systems, their limitations, and how reinforcement learning overcomes these challenges to build more robust IDS. Next, we explore state-of-the-art research in RL-IDS for smart cities. Finally, we provide insights into future directions for research in RL-IDS for smart cities and highlight the potential benefits of these systems for enhancing the security of these environments.},

The main contribution is the scoping review of cybersecurity ontologies applied to health, well-being and similar aspects of care. The review indicated the dual need for ontologies in such systems - the first to structure the meaning of well-being and health data, and the second to structure the meaning of cybersecurity approaches, measures, techniques, etc. to protect such data.

  abstract={With current technological advancements in IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and networking (e.g., 5G/6G) technologies, we are swiftly moving towards enabling future connected smart communities. We envision a smart community (SC) as an inter-connected ecosystem ranging from a small region to a global scale enabled by IoT devices and key technologies for the betterment of its citizens, businesses, and organizations. A critical aspect for enabling such future smart communities is developing a secure and privacy-preserving access control (AC) framework to defend against malicious actors in the system. Traditionally, access control principles have been formulated based on the access control requirements of an enterprise, an application or a system. Smart communities are an evolving and dynamic concept that includes a range of interdisciplinary components. Thus it is appropriate to reevaluate current access control principles for such a diverse and dynamic ecosystem. In this paper, we first discuss access control requirements and then present access control principles for future smart communities. We envision a convergent access control approach towards enabling future smart communities where different access control models synergistically converge at both policy and enforcement layers. Therefore, we propose a Convergent Access Control (CAC) framework that can address the access control requirements of dynamic application domains such as in future smart communities. The main goal of this paper is to present the vision and need for the CAC framework and initiate discussion on the future research agenda.},

  abstract={Recent work has proven the effort of researchers to integrate small sensors and a cloud environment, delivering the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensors as a service are one of the leading research concerns in this context. Nevertheless, security is becoming one of the most significant attributes of the IoT as sensors become more human-independent and are being extensively used to monitor human lives. That way, IoT brings many key security challenges that need attention, some of which we address in this position paper. We present a cloud-based infrastructure that can deliver sensors and actuators as a service, providing secure communication between them and the control nodes on which IoT applications rely while implementing Big Data algorithms. For mapping our proposal, two scenarios related to Health Assistance are discussed, considering secure communications in a sensor network. In conclusion, we propose a scope for future research in this field considering digital twin concepts. Since domains exploiting IoT technologies can benefit from adopting Digital Twin, our goal is to evolve a virtual sensor and actuator system into this technology.},

  abstract={With the widespread coverage of location-based services (LBS), privacy protection of trajectory data is increasingly important. The starting and ending locations of trajectories often contain rich sensitive information. In order to avoid the unnecessary information loss caused by the large anonymous area of published trajectory datasets and protect semantic information of the starting and ending locations, this paper proposes a privacy protection method based on trajectory segment graph division. The method takes into account direction, shape and semantic differences of trajectory segments to measure the spatiotemporal and semantic relationships of trajectory segments. Firstly, the initial and final trajectory segment equivalence classes are constructed with different time stamps. Secondly, we propose a grid filtering method to calculate the shape distance matrix of equivalence class, meanwhile a location semantic classification tree is built to store the semantic information of locations. Finally, the graph division method is used to construct K-anonymous sets of trajectory segments and publish them. Experimental results in real datasets show that the proposed scheme can improve data availability while ensuring a certain degree of data privacy.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has become increasingly popular due to the growing number of IoT devices and the adoption of numerous communication protocols. With the renewed interest in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning and recent reports on privacy infringements through UWB-enabled spyware, the consideration of privacy in UWB applications has become paramount. Currently, an IoT-centric security database is under development, VarIoT, however, there is no filter for privacy-or protocol-based vulnerabilities, risks, or threats and current UWB literature does not focus on privacy.Thus, this work formalizes privacy risks as attack patterns, based on the UWB protocol and presents it in an ontology. The effectiveness of this ontology is exemplified by a case study that receives UWB artifacts as input and derives a set of privacy risks by relying on the presented formalized knowledge graph. By exhibiting the ontology’s ability to automatically derive threats for an applied scenario an increased privacy preservation in UWB networks and solutions is reached.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 is a revolution in manufacturing by introducing disruptive technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-computing into the heart of the factory. The resulting increased automation and the improved production synergy between stocks, supply chains and customer demands, come along with the threats and attacks from the Internet. Despite extensive literature on the cybersecurity topic, many actors in manufacturing factories are just realizing the impact of cybersecurity in the preservation of their business. This paper introduces step-by-step the concepts and practical aspects of an Industry 4.0 manufacturing factory that are related to cybersecurity. Based on a subdivision of a typical factory into several generic perimeters, we present the vulnerabilities and threats regarding the network and devices usually found in each perimeter. Therefore, it is more efficient to present the recent proposals of the literature regarding cybersecurity guidelines and solutions in Industry 4.0. Instead of spreading a lot of references regarding every aspect of cybersecurity, we focused on a limited number of papers among the recent references. However, for each paper, we provide the details about the purpose of the proposal, the methodology adopted, the technical solution developed and its evaluation by the authors. These solutions range from classical cybersecurity countermeasures to innovative ones, such as those based on honeypots and digital twins. In order to deliver a review also useful to non scientists, we present our guidelines along with those of some organizations involved in cybersecurity harmonization and standardization in the world.},

  pages={37-49},
  abstract={At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.},

This implies a substantial integration of AI, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Robotics, big data, Blockchain, and 5G communications in support of smart manufacturing and the dynamical processes in modern industries. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of different aspects of AI and big data in Industry 4.0 with a particular focus on key applications, techniques, the concepts involved, key enabling technologies, challenges, and research perspective toward deployment of Industry 5.0. In detail, we highlight and analyze how the duo of AI and big data is helping in different applications of Industry 4.0. We also highlight key challenges in a successful deployment of AI and big data solutions in smart industrial applications with a particular emphasis on data-related issues, such as availability, bias, auditing, management, interpretability, communication, and different adversarial attacks and security issues. Finally, we explore the significance of AI and big data toward Industry 4.0 applications through panoramic reviews and discussions.

  abstract={Networked control systems (NCSs) have played a key role in Internet of Things (IoTs) to realize the vision of a fully interactive and responsive intelligent environment. However, traditional NCSs cannot address the challenges of big data collection, storage and analysis brought by large-scale IoTs applications. Thanks to the rapid development of cloud computing and control theory, a new paradigm of NCSs named cloud control systems (CCSs) has been proposed to address the challenges. Since proposed in 2012, it has drawn wide attentions from industry and academia. In this brief, we survey the recent advances of CCSs. Particularly, we present a taxonomy of existing results for CCSs, which include cloud control perspectives of traditional control techniques, security and privacy of cloud-based control, and CCSs for industry automation. We discuss each category in depth by comparing and contrasting different approaches subsequently. Finally, some future directions of how to design more efficient and practical CCSs have been discussed.},

  abstract={In the last years the interconnection and ongoing development of physical systems combined with cyber resources has led to increasing automation. Through this progress in technology, autonomous vehicles, especially autonomous trains are getting more attention from industry and are already under test. The use of autonomous trains is known for increasing operation efficiency and reduction of personnel and infrastructure costs, which is mostly considered for main tracks. However, for less-used secondary lines, autonomous trains and their underlying sensor infrastructure are not yet considered. Thus, a system needs to be developed, which is less expensive for installation and operation of these trains and underlying infrastructure for secondary lines. Therefore, this position paper describes the process of how to derive an approach to help develop a digital interlocking system at design time for the use with secondary railway lines. In this work, we motivate the necessary research by investigating gaps in existing work as well as presenting a possible solution for this problem, a meta-model. The model considers safety, security as well as interoperability like 5G and socio-technical aspects to provide a holistic modeling approach for the development of the interlocking system for industrial secondary line use cases.},

  abstract={The automotive domain has got its own share of advancements in information and communication technology, providing more services and leading to more connectivity. However, more connectivity and openness raise cyber security and safety concerns. Indeed, services that depend on online connectivity can serve as entry points for attacks on different assets of the vehicle. This study explores collaborative ways of selecting response techniques to counter real-time cyber attacks on automotive systems. The aim is to mitigate the attacks more quickly than a single vehicle would be able to do, and increase the survivability chances of the collaborating vehicles. To achieve that, the design science research methodology is employed. As a result, we present RIPOSTE, a framework for collaborative real-time evaluation and selection of suitable response techniques when an attack is in progress. We evaluate the framework from a safety perspective by conducting a qualitative study involving domain experts. The proposed framework is deemed slightly unsafe, and insights into how to improve the overall safety of the framework are provided.},

  abstract={Human-Cyber-Physical-Systems (HPCS), such as critical infrastructures in modern society, are subject to several systemic threats due to their complex interconnections and interdependencies. Management of systemic threats requires a paradigm shift from static risk assessment to holistic resilience modeling and evaluation using intelligent, data-driven and run-time approaches. In fact, the complexity and criticality of HCPS requires timely decisions considering many parameters and implications, which in turn require the adoption of advanced monitoring frameworks and evaluation tools. In order to tackle such challenge, we introduce those new paradigms in a framework named RESILTRON, envisioning Digital Twins (DT) to support decision making and improve resilience in HCPS under systemic stress. In order to represent possibly complex and heterogeneous HCPS, together with their environment and stressors, we leverage on multi-simulation approaches, combining multiple formalisms, data-driven approaches and Artificial Intelligence (AI) modelling paradigms, through a structured, modular and compositional framework. DT are used to provide an adaptive abstract representation of the system in terms of multi-layered spatially-embedded dynamic networks, and to apply self-adaptation to time-warped What-If analyses, in order to find the best sequence of decisions to ensure resilience under uncertainty and continuous HPCS evolution.},

  abstract={A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.},

  abstract={The invention of personal computer together with its rapid deployment around the world are among the most important achievements that have changed lives of people in this planet. In modern society, people are becoming more dependent on computer devices. However, it’s difficult to bring computer hardware with us at any time and in any place, which is known as the desktop-go-with-person (DGWP) problem. Regarding it’s easy to find a nearby computer and bring tiny non-volatile memory devices with us, putting the entire desktop system software into pocket storage and loading it on any available hardware become an attractive approach. However, current computer software are tightly bound to hardware. Live USB systems are quite popular for trial run purpose; however, they are read-only system and limited to certain OSes. Also, the creating of live USB system from native installed desktop system is dependent to OS. In this paper, we proposed a new generic UEFI-based secure system-in-pocket-storage approach (SSPS) to address the DGWP problem by decoupling native installed system software from hardware, making software go with person and running it with any other computer hardware. The paper illustrated the SSPS overall block diagram and workflow, internal architecture, data structure and management of desktop system image, image loader and virtual disk driver, and security considerations during the design and implementation. Also, the paper provided system evaluation of SSPS approach as well as technology forecasts.},

  abstract={Virtualized collaboration can significantly increase remote management of critical infrastructures. Crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic push the technology: they require remote management to keep our infrastructures running. Mixed Reality (MR) prototypes enable remote management in diverse fields such as medicine, industry 4.0, energy systems, education, or cyber awareness. However, the evolution of virtualized collaboration is still in the beginning. By design, MR is fake: its reality is generated from models. This makes detecting attacks very difficult. Many MR-attacks result from well-known cybersecurity threats. This paper identifies classic attack surfaces, vectors, and concrete threats that are relevant for MR. It presents mitigation methods that can help to secure the underlying data exchanges. However, distributed systems are often heterogeneous and under different management authorities, making securing the entire virtualized remote management stack difficult. The paper therefore also introduces considerations towards an MR-client-based attack detection, i.e., MR-forensics, including relevant features and the use of machine learning.},

However, the existing network resource aggregation efficiency is relatively low, making it difficult to provide adaptive and differentiated services for users with different needs. To address this, we propose a resource aggregation and orchestration scheme based on network digital twinning. Firstly, we propose the system architecture of network digital twinning, which simulates and manages the network by establishing digital models, enabling flexible scalability and elastic pooling of resources. Secondly, we design network service mechanisms for different users, providing adaptive service solutions for enterprises of different scales and different types of businesses, thereby expanding the boundaries and market vitality of network services. Lastly, we propose a real-time resource orchestration mechanism that reduces computational complexity by leveraging the properties of optimal substructures. We validate the proposed architecture and algorithms in the digital twinning space, providing a new method for reducing network upgrade costs and improving resource utilization efficiency using network digital twinning.},

Hence, the security issues that come with it are gradually becoming sharper and sharper.

A comprehensive artificial intelligence system, combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) architectures, has been developed to detect, categorize, and evaluate BIM projects throughout their life cycle. The scalability prospects for point cloud and mesh models, as well as the use of big data technology to optimize the representation of the digital twin, are also addressed. The study determines the effectiveness of construction site conformance detection during the construction of a BIM model, providing consistency and a quantitative evaluation of the processes taking place on the construction site. The findings of this research can be used to enhance BIM modeling methods and concepts toward a multi-stage representation of the digital twin of the construction site.},

  abstract={Email threat is a serious issue for enterprise security. The threat can be in various malicious forms, such as phishing, fraud, blackmail and malvertisement. The traditional anti-spam gateway often maintains a greylist to filter out unexpected emails based on suspicious vocabularies present in the email’s subject and contents. However, this type of signature-based approach cannot effectively discover novel and unknown suspicious emails that utilize various evolving malicious payloads. To address the problem, in this paper, we present HOLMES, an efficient and lightweight semantic based engine for anomalous email detection. HOLMES can convert each email event log into a sentence through word embedding and then identify abnormalities that deviate from a historical baseline based on those translated sentences. We have evaluated the performance of HOLMES in a real-world enterprise environment, where around 5,000 emails are sent/received each day. In our experiments, HOLMES shows a high capability to detect email threats, especially those that cannot be handled by the enterprise anti-spam gateway. It is also demonstrated through our experiment that HOLMES can discover more concealed malicious emails that are immune from several commercial detection tools.},

Each element under the SPA framework is defined and illustrated by an example of production plan optimization.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things is a novel and promising paradigm already being part of some of our daily activities. At the end of this year, the Internet will connect about 7 billion smart things. They are part of solutions ranging from Smart Cities to telemetry collection for Industrial applications generating a colossal amount of real-time streaming data. Cloud-based services have also being evolved from pure IaaS providing Virtual Machines to sophisticated PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS designed explicitly for Big Data, Analytics and IoT, they all exhibiting serverless architectures. Moreover, Information Retrieval (IR) is becoming a crucial application layer on top of IoT application for searching and retrieving relevant data on the real-time streaming collections, on sensors, or things. In the last years, a significant set of approaches have been explored IoT, Big Data, and IoT Search Engines. However, the cybersecurity has not been meticulously researched. Neither for IoT nor IR, as a critical component at searching on the IoT. In this paper, we present an approach to consider cybersecurity as an IR dimension for cloud-based edge-powered searching over IoT from a theoretical perspective, we compare through a compact survey the related works and finalise with a multi-perspective discussion to embrace cybersecurity in the IoT/IoTSE architectures.},

  abstract={Digital Twins and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two of the most prominent recent concepts and technologies. The IoT supports many applications that merge the physical with the cyber world. This highlights the need for improved security. Here, we argue that digital twins can help in securing and strengthening the IoT by using them for interacting with the actual IoT devices. While most digital twins implementations are centralized, we propose to integrate Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and digital twins into the IoT to realize decentralized, secure, available, flexible, and auditable blockchain-based IoT services for IoT devices that follow the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standards. In this work, we present the design of SmartTwin, a blockchain-based digital twin framework for which we provide two different implementations using two different blockchains, we present the design trade-offs, and we discuss future research and development directions.},

  abstract={At present, the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly setting off a huge wave of digitalization in traditional industries. In the era of the Internet of Everything, massive data is generated by IoT devices. Recently, Blockchain has attracted more and more attentions in the field of IoT due to its decentralization, traceability, security and so on. Many IoT-oriented data services are built based on distributed ledger technology like blockchains. However, due to the lack of scalability and high transaction costs of the public blockchain, it is hard to directly apply the blockchain technology to IoT scenarios. The recent transaction directed acyclic graph (TDAG) technology, especially Tangle, is suitable for low-latency M2M (Machine to Machine) micropayment transactions in the ever-growing scale of the edge-centric IoT. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate Tangle into IoT blockchains and build a cross-chain interactive decentralized access model in the context of data management. We employ a consortium blockchain as the control station, and Tangle runs as the backbone of all IoT devices. It is equivalent to opening the off-chain channel of the DAG Tangle structure on the consortium blockchain. Transactions in these channels form the sub-Tangle and then merge sub-Tangle into the main Tangle for confirmation through the notary mechanism. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed model and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.},

  abstract={In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior. In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical Systems can be defined as a complex networked control system, which normally develop by combining several physical components with the cyber space. Cyber Physical System are already a part of our daily life. As its already being a part of everyone life, CPS also have great potential security threats and can be vulnerable to various cyber-attacks without showing any sign directly to component failure. To protect user security and privacy is a fundamental concern of any kind of system; either it's a simple web application or supplicated professional system. Digital Multifactor authentication is one of the best ways to make secure authentication. It covers many different areas of a Cyber-connected world, including online payments, communications, access right management, etc. Most of the time, Multifactor authentication is little complex as it requires extra step from users. This paper will discuss the evolution from single authentication to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) starting from Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) and through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This paper seeks to analyze and evaluate the most prominent authentication techniques based on accuracy, cost, and feasibility of implementation. We also suggest several authentication schemes which incorporate with Multifactor authentication for CPS.},

  abstract={Identifying user clicks from passive traces is the fundamental task for user behavior analysis, which is important for understanding modern web usage and providing optimized personalized service. With the widespread adoption of encryption protocols, identifying user clicks in encrypted web traffic becomes more and more challenging. Existing studies on user click identification mainly focus on information extracted from request packets, which makes them difficult to apply over encrypted traffic and large network. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based method for user click identification in encrypted web traffic. We observe that the flows directly driven by user clicks have uniform communication patterns for classification. Thus, we turn user click identification into a flow classification problem and apply a GNN-based classifier to learn flow patterns accurately. We collect two real-world traffic datasets and conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the existing baseline methods in terms of performance and stability.},

  abstract={The goal is to explore the prediction performance of energy consumption in digital twins of the intelligent factory in the process of urbanization, so that it can provide good guidance for the green development of cities. The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.},

  abstract={As the global industrial complex gears toward fulfilling the tenets of Industry 4.0 and beyond, technologies such as distributed ledger technologies, digital twins, and artificial intelligence become pivotal enablers. In the last decade, metaverse as a concept and technology found its place among crucial enablers for technology and digital advancement across several engineering domains. Metaverse has the potential to combine the elements from distributed computing platforms, the digital evolution of physical systems, and advanced learning systems to unearth a fully digitized world of comparative properties of the real world. We should ensure the privacy, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data. These requirements will lead to proper identity management in the metaverse. Given the complex nature of the metaverse, traditional centralized systems may not offer a viable identity management solution. Therefore, this study explores a decentralized identity management system called the Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) as a logical alternative to traditional centralized identity management systems. The proposed holistic framework aims to ignite new ideas and discussions related to the combined deployment of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), SSI, and metaverse to inspire new implementation areas within the Industry 4.0 environment. The paper also discusses various opportunities, enablers, technical & privacy aspects, legislation requirements, and other barriers related to SSI implementation.},

  abstract={To predict the transportation process of a class of metamorphic object, e.g., deformable interlink linear object (DLO), the system particularity and coupling complexity is much increased due to external metamorphic constraints compared with classic multi-robot manipulation system. To explore the coupling effect, a virtual DLO model described by wave PDE equations with velocity feedback is proposed for replacing external metamorphic constraints. Independent stability controller is designed for feedback control of virtual DLO from perspective of MSR considering model stabilization. With the integration of proposed virtual DLO model, a digital-twin prediction prototype system of metamorphic object transportation is established. To bridge the communication gap between physical and digital world, a THz communication-based system framework is proposed to implement the digital-twin prediction for extremely security-sensitive system. Both numeric simulation and industrial experiment prove the availability and feasibility.},

This paper is prepared with the intent to share about current industry challenges, the values brought by CPC, current efforts in realizing CPC, the requirements, aspiration, as well as the risk associated to CPC installation in oil & gas industry. Centralized Protection and Control or CPC is a protection system with the concept of relocating the functions and features that resides in a protection relay to a centralized device. As protection system is one of Safety Critical Element in Oil and Gas Industry. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) team is looking for features to operate and manage protection relay in a more advanced manner. As the technology evolved, the advancement of hardware capability allows for more computing power in a centralized device to process larger protection data and execute protection function. By having a centralized protection device, complete with digital database supported with analytical tools, and customized features, managing a wide range of protection relays in large scale electrical installation becomes easier and more efficient. Digitalization, centralization, remote monitoring and remote automation are the key step towards realizing digital twins of electrical protection system, thus supporting the reduction of operational costs in such facilities.},

  abstract={The offshore platforms in Peninsular Malaysia water are located hundreds of kilometers away from shore which were already more than 30 years in operations. Based on the available technology during that time, all main platforms were designed with manned operation facilities, which requires operators to be mobilized and available 24hrs on the platforms. Over the years, the operational cost becomes higher due to the offshore logistics and maintenance of the aging facilities. As there is a need to reduce the escalated operating cost while optimizing production, coupled with the necessity to enhance HSE while working at high-risk operation, the requirement to convert to unmanned platform with remote-controlled operations and the integration of intelligent-based system for equipment and system analytics has become more relevant and demanding. This is also supported by the advancement of digital and network communication technologies with the availability of data centralization and integration as well as intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) with standardized communication protocol that are more affordable and reliable as compared to previous years. Although remote operation is not a new practice to the electrical operation particularly at onshore facilities, implementing electrical remote operation at offshore facilities with the integration of intelligent-based systems is considered as a breakthrough in offshore environment. This paper describes the current pain points, description on the proposed solution, the challenges to realize the solution, as well as the way forward and steps taken to overcome such challenges.},

  abstract={The integration of information and communication technology in distribution grids presents opportunities for active grid operation management, but also increases the need for security against power outages and cyberattacks. This paper examines the impact of cyberattacks on smart grids by replicating the power grid in a secure laboratory environment as a cyber-physical digital twin. A simulation is used to study communication infrastructures for secure operation of smart grids. The cyber-physical digital twin approach combines communication network emulation and power grid simulation in a common modular environment, and is demonstrated through laboratory tests and attack replications.},

  abstract={On the one hand, laparoscopic surgery as medical state-of-the-art method is minimal invasive, and thus less stressful for patients. On the other hand, laparoscopy implies higher demands on physicians, such as mental load or preparation time, hence appropriate technical support is essential for quality and suc-cess. Medical Digital Twins provide an integrated and virtual representation of patients' and organs' data, and thus a generic concept to make complex information accessible by surgeons. In this way, minimal invasive surgery could be improved significantly, but requires also a much more complex software system to achieve the various resulting requirements. The biggest challenges for these systems are the safe and precise mapping of the digital twin to reality, i.e. dealing with deformations, movement and distortions, as well as balance out the competing requirement for intuitive and immersive user access and security. The case study ARAILIS is presented as a proof in concept for such a system and provides a starting point for further research. Based on the insights delivered by this prototype, a vision for future Medical Digital Twins in surgery is derived and discussed.},

  abstract={In the upcoming 6G era, existing ground networks have evolved toward space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), providing ultra-high data rates, seamless network coverage, and ubiquitous intelligence for communications of applications and services. However, conventional communications in SAGIN still face data confidentiality issues. Fortunately, the concept of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) over SAGIN is able to provide information-theoretic security for secure communications in SAGIN with quantum cryptography. Therefore, in this article, we propose quantum-secured SAGIN (Q-SAGIN) which are feasible to achieve proven secure communications using quantum mechanics to protect data channels between space, aerial, and ground nodes. Moreover, we propose a universal QKD service provisioning framework to minimize the cost of QKD services under the uncertainty and dynamics of communications in Q-SAGIN. In this framework, fiber-based QKD services are deployed in passive optical networks with the advantages of low loss and high stability. Moreover, the widely covered and flexible satellite-and UAV-based QKD services are provisioned as a supplement during the real-time data transmission phase. Finally, to examine the effectiveness of the proposed concept and framework, a case study of Q-SAGIN in the Metaverse is conducted where uncertain and dynamic factors of the secure communications in Metaverse applications are effectively resolved in the proposed framework.},

  abstract={A paradigm change toward a more consumer approach has been observed in Industry 4.0, moving away from cyber-physical platforms (CPS) that seek for huge automation. The development of hyper cognitive systems, the incorporation of extended and virtual reality, the prototyping of digital machinery, and twin designs have all been cited as contributing factors to the shift. The collaborative robots, trusted machine boundaries, and supply chains powered by artificial intelligence (AI). It is anticipated that this new trend, known as Industry 5.0, would go beyond the purview of Industry 4.0 ecosystems and use large production with user-centric customization. Industry 5.0 is anticipated to support a variety of industrial verticals, including healthcare, smart agriculture, aircraft, microgrids, and supply chain manufacturing ecosystems. In contrast, information is shared across numerous heterogeneous networks that span various authority domains. So, for the industrial perimeters to synergize and be secure, trusted and secure data communication is essential. Due to its intrinsic property of absoluteness, chronological, and integrity in industrial systems, one of the most promising technologies for enhancing the security of Industrial 5.0 environments is blockchaintechnology.. Only a few books are suggested that outline the applications for Industry 5.0 that are supported by Blockchain. The piece delivers a groundbreaking study on Block chain’s role in Industry 5.0 as a security enabler. With the use of a subjective survey method and study objectives, we were able to identify the most pressing drivers, potential uses, and present an institutional vision for Blockchain-based Industry 5.0 across many different sectors.

  volume={41},
  number={10},
  pages={3212-3229},
  abstract={In Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks, dynamic service migration can support service continuity and reduce user-perceived delay. However, service migration in MEC networks faces significant challenges due to the uncertainty in future traffic demands, the distributed architecture of MEC networks, high operating costs and the dynamism of network resources. Digital Twins (DT), which achieve the mapping of physical entities to virtual digital models in cyberspace, provide new perspectives for intelligent and efficient service provisioning in MEC networks. In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction-assisted federated deep reinforcement learning scheme to efficiently migrate services and improve the cost efficiency of DT-enabled MEC networks. Specifically, to address the coupled spatio-temporal dependencies of mobile traffic and the imbalance in traffic data, a Multi-order Spatio-temporal information integration-based distributed Traffic Prediction (MSTP) scheme is proposed, which achieves high-accuracy mobile traffic prediction at a low cost. Then, we propose a Federated Cooperative cost-efficient Service Migration (FCSM) algorithm that adaptively adjusts service migration strategies in a distributed manner to respond to future traffic demands. Moreover, a theoretical model is developed to analyze the convergence of FCSM and derive the upper bound of the time-average squared gradient norm. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve excellent traffic prediction performance, enhance users’ Quality of Service (QoS), and significantly reduce the system cost of MEC networks.},

  abstract={In this era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), edge computing has emerged as the critical enabling technology to solve a series of issues caused by an increasing amount of interconnected devices and large-scale data transmission. However, the deficiencies of edge computing paradigm are gradually being magnified in the context of IoE, especially in terms of service migration, security and privacy preservation, and deployment issues of edge node. These issues can not be well addressed by conventional approaches. Thanks to the rapid development of upcoming technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and microservices, novel and more effective solutions have emerged and been applied to solve existing challenges. In addition, edge computing can be deeply integrated with technologies in other domains (e.g., AI, blockchain, 6G, and digital twin) through interdisciplinary intersection and practice, releasing the potential for mutual benefit. These promising integrations need to be further explored and researched. In addition, edge computing provides strong support in applications scenarios, such as remote working, new physical retail industries, and digital advertising, which has greatly changed the way we live, work, and study. In this article, we present an up-to-date survey of the edge computing research. In addition to introducing the definition, model, and characteristics of edge computing, we discuss a set of key issues in edge computing and novel solutions supported by emerging technologies in IoE era. Furthermore, we explore the potential and promising trends from the perspective of technology integration. Finally, new application scenarios and the final form of edge computing are discussed.},

  abstract={This article discusses the problem of studying the risks associated with information and communication systems of medical organizations in the context of their digital transformation and with the storage of medical data in a cloud geographically distributed infrastructure. Information about the health status of patients, their personal data and the results of medical research are classified as confidential information, which is the object of increased attention of cybercriminals. The widespread transformation of healthcare organizations, the creation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystems based on wireless sensor networks are increasing the number of potential risks of confidential information leakage. Medical data requires constant protection. The problem of identifying risks in order to develop methods and tools for their management in the future is further complicated by the fact that Healthcare Industry is increasingly beginning to use the cloud architecture of the IoMT, which in turn increases the potential threats to patients' confidential information. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of ransomware programs that are being introduced into IoMT devices has increased, cyberattacks are becoming more complex with a significantly higher risk of fatal consequences for patients due to changes in the technical parameters of medical equipment by attackers. This makes it urgent to solve the problem of identifying possible risks in IoMT tools and systems, assessing their impact and possible consequences from unauthorized actions of intruders for patients and the medical organization as a whole.},

  abstract={The development of the intelligent Internet of Things has facilitated the adoption of high-efficiency Multiple Targets Tracking (MTT) in many civil security applications. However, existing MTT technologies cannot offer full capability in accurate and real-time MTT for civil security. Many attractive applications in the next-generation wireless network, like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm, are envisioned to be exploited for enhanced MTT with the advantage of flexibility. Nonetheless, highly dynamic moving targets impose some new challenges. UAVs cannot always perform expected cooperative tracking in conventional architectures as well. To address these problems, we design a tiered Digital Twin-assisted tracking framework in this paper, which leverages multi-grained imitation for real-time and accurate MTT. Firstly, we imitate a coarse-grained MTT to guarantee a high successful tracking ratio. We design a fine-grained imitation with a reaction-diffusion mechanism to explore the feasible cooperators based on trajectory prediction. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations demonstrate that our tiered framework can reduce 66.7% of the system latency overhead compared to the conventional DDPG benchmark while improving the successful tracking ratio by 30.6%.},

  abstract={In recent years, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) came into being. IIoT connects sensors, industrial equipment, products, and staff in the factory, enabling context-awareness and industrial equipment automate control. The identity resolution system is a core infrastructure in IIoT. Similar to the role of Domain Name System (DNS) on the Internet, it is the entrance to the IIoT. The difference between them is their input and output. The input of the identity resolution system in IIoT is an identifier of an object. And the output is the mapping data attached to the identifier, including the product profile, a URL, or the identifier's surrounding environment. However, how to deploy an identity resolution system in IIoT has not yet been conclusive. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the potential identity resolution systems that may be used in IIoT. Firstly, an overview of the identity resolution system is introduced, including a reference framework that can be used to evaluate an identity resolution system. Then we review some influential identity resolution systems based on this reference framework. After that, we make a comparison from the perspective of whether they can meet IIoT requirements and technology selection. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.},

  abstract={Relevant today is the digitalization of industrial enterprises, which is an evolutionary continuation of the introduction of MES/MOM. At the same time, an important role is played by the construction of mathematical models for various purposes, which are the main component of the Digital Twin development. Digital Twin provides a new philosophy for conducting enterprise production processes based on these models, which is aimed at improving the efficiency of both individual sectors and the enterprise as a whole. To increase the profit of the enterprise, it is necessary to ensure the planned productivity of technological processes, the final indicator of which is the yield of sugar. Taking into account that a significant number of material flows operate at the enterprise, only production flows with which the operator-technologist works are singled out in the work. The selected flows, based on expert assessments, were assigned weighted values of the impact on the overall performance of the sugar production. This made it possible to build a mathematical model that predicts the yield of sugar from input flows. The structure and parameters of this model are determined by machine learning methods. This is a feed-forward neural network MLP 7-23-23-1, which provides forecast accuracy with an error of less than 1%. The model can be used to model, correct, and predict the process conditions of an enterprise, which will increase the overall productivity of the sugar factory.},

  abstract={There are considerable challenges in designing the next generation of avionics systems in aircraft and spacecraft platforms. Security presents an eminent challenge. The most sensitive pieces of equipment on board are mostly electronics and hence the necessity for added protection against cyber-attacks and intrusions. Attacks on flight control and avionics systems may influence physical processes and flight dynamics through digital manipulations. These digital manipulations can be disastrous for safety critical systems. The modular distributed architectures for avionics offer considerable benefits for commercial and military aerospace platforms. The networked architecture of distributed embedded and avionics systems (i.e., communication between its distributed nodes) makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks and intrusions. The vulnerabilities in the communication and control network of a safety critical system necessitate the development of detection, identification, and mitigation techniques to make the system more secure. To mitigate the risks for cyber-attacks and intrusions in safety critical flight control systems, there is a need for Zero Trust Avionics Systems (ZTAS). Given the increase in breaches and cyber-attacks on aerospace and defense systems, implementing a Zero Trust architecture (ZTA) for aircraft / spacecraft systems is inevitable. Zero trust architecture prevents various types of data breaches by eliminating the concept of trust from avionics systems architecture. Rooted in the principle of "never trust, always verify," ZT architecture can protect modern digital and embedded systems in flying vehicles. Seamless integration of cyber security features within avionics systems is crucial. Added ZT security components can impede avionics systems’ functionality. Well-defined approaches for simultaneously designing functionality and ZT cyber security for avionics are needed. These approaches should ensure system confidentiality/security and integrity while maintaining functionality.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are infrastructures with capabilities of perception, networking, and computation. They consist of physical and virtual components that interact with their environment. Their main goal is to monitor the physical system in real-time to have its behavior under control. Some of these infrastructures require well-defined security measures due to their critical processing capabilities. Digital Twins are defined as virtual structures emulating the physical components in various systems. They enable the deployment of isolated simulation environments to test changes and specify the security issues of a CPS. One of the main applications of CPS is smart grids. Microservices allow us to create fine-grained operations on automation systems. Using small, well-defined, modular processes, we can observe the states of smart grid infrastructure in many stages. In this work, we aim to design a framework that can create a reliable environment for smart grids compliant with existing industrial standards. We propose a service-oriented digital twins framework consisting of entities such as power meters, data aggregators, and system parameters for providing a scalable and highly available platform for complex energy systems.},

These issues are decided using mathematical methods of operations exploration, numerical minimization methods and others.One of the new and effective methods of analyzing the state of the production system in industry 4.0 is neural network data analysis. The ongoing research on the use of neural networks is aimed at their use in solving production management problems.It is proposed to use artificial intelligence apparatus to optimize separate multi-nomenclature production. Each new task of optimal choice of parameters for the structure of production should be based on previously revealed decisions. Thus, it is proposed to create a learning system that provides a solution based on the accumulated "knowledge". Neural networks appertain to such systems [7]–[12].Neural networks will solve 2 tasks:• will be an "add-on" over the existing Product Lifecycle Management and Enterprise Resource Planning functionality at enterprises;• will take into account factors affecting production.The proposed approach should expand the enterprise's mobility capabilities in making managerial decisions at all levels of management, throughout the life cycle. The models being developed should become a functional extension of digital production processes.},

  abstract={Grieves and Vickers in 2017 formally defined a Digital Twin (DT) as consisting of three primary elements: a physical object in the physical space, a virtual object in the virtual space, and the data link between the two spaces. Recently, significant attention has been paid to the use of DTs in a large variety of application domains which would benefit of the use of several DTs that share knowledge and experiences gained though their Artificial Intelligence-empowered logic. The need for DT collaboration has stimulated some initial studies on DT networks. However, complete solutions supporting collaboration between DTs are still missing. Taking inspiration by previous researches which propose to exploit social relationships among devices in the IoT, in this paper we introduce a micro service-based platform supporting the set up and management of relationships among DTs which are plugged in the platform for interacting in a social environment. By exploiting such relationships, it is possible for DT to interact and cooperate with each others in a trusty environment.},

  pages={213-217},
  abstract={This paper presents a Digital Twin (DT)-based methodology for real-time assessment of microgrid resilience. Unlike conventional assessment methods, the proposed approach makes use of live system data via the DT of a microgrid; considers not only the steady-state power/energy balancing, but also the dynamic system security constraints under adverse operational conditions associated with line or generator outages. A real-time model based on the future anticipated microgrid at the University of Strathclyde campus has been developed in the RTDS simulator, and a prototype DT of the microgrid and the proposed DT-based resilience assessment have been implemented on a hardware platform, which is interfaced with the RTDS via communication links for realistic demonstration. Preliminary results are generated to illustrate the fundamental concepts of the approach, where N-1 tests and a large sample size are used to generate visualisations of system risk and impact of different events to identify high risk components and compute performance metrics e.g. loss of load probability. This work is intended to be continued on larger networks with more complex systems to demonstrate the value of fast-acting resilience quantification.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={778-787},
  abstract={Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning is one of the most critical issues in cloud computing. However, the long delay in VM provisioning significantly degrades the customer experience. Especially, the time-consumption of transferring Virtual Machine Images (VMI) from storage nodes to selected compute nodes is one of the major factors that cause the delay in VM provisioning. Unfortunately, existing approaches usually make their efforts to improve efficiency at the cost of disk performance. In this paper, we propose an intelligent VMI prefetching approach to expedite VM provisioning. First, we identify the data blocks necessary for VMs startup from the whole VMI and record their access order. Then, we design a VMI prefetching mechanism to reduce data transmission, which transfers only a small amount of startup block to compute node during the pre-steps stage (i.e., the short time before startup). Next, we employ a VM request prediction model which leverages historical records to predict the number of requests for each VM type in the future period, so as to perform VMI prefetching in advance, thus reducing VM suspension caused by the preparation of requested blocks. Furthermore, we implement a prototype named PreVMI and perform a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our approach. Experiments show that our approach can reduce VM provisioning latency by about 35%.},

  abstract={Collaborative intelligence data analysis can effectively dig out valuable information from massive data to support decision-making. Ensuring data credibility in collaboration under the background of big data is a crucial problem to be solved. In addition, the low willingness of analysts to share results in low efficiency of collaborative tasks. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a blockchain-based intelligence collaborative analysis and sharing framework, ICASChain, which contains a highly trusted intelligence collaboration mechanism and a dynamically adjustable incentive mechanism. Based on Evolutionary Game Theory, this paper analyzes the evolutionary stability strategy of intelligence sharing willingness of analysts by constructing a replication dynamic equation. We use a smart contract incentive algorithm including ICASToken to dynamically regulate them to increase the proportion of users participating in intelligence sharing. Finally, the influencing factors of information sharing and the incentive effect of the incentive model are discussed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the proposed ICASChain has essential application value in improving the analysts’ willingness to collaborate and share intelligence and the correctness of the analysis results.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field of computer networks, in which resource-constrained objects connect to the Internet by using a wide range of technologies. Due to the features of sensors used in the IoT networks and the insecure nature of the Internet, IoT is vulnerable to many internal routing attacks. A novel distributed hybrid intrusion detection framework is proposed in this paper, which is composed of anomaly-based and signature-based intrusion detection modules for detecting routing attacks in the RPL-based IoT networks. According to the commonality of these attacks, we propose an anomaly detection method based on information entropy and deploy it in the border router of the network. A lightweight module is deployed in client nodes to collect and report information to the border router. The abnormal nodes will be further checked by the signature module to determine the attack type. We have fully implemented the proposed approach in the Contiki IoT operating system and extensively evaluated it through Cooja emulation in comparison with two representative schemes. The results of our experiments show the feasibility and superiority of our proposal in terms of detection accuracy, detection time, energy consumption and memory overhead.},

  abstract={Testing the resiliency of complex IT services deployed in hybrid Cloud scenarios is a challenging task that requires expensive and possibly destructive operations. An interesting approach lies in Chaos Engineering, a set of practices to test the resiliency of software systems running in a production environment. However, Chaos Engineering is an expensive practice that requires the setup of complicated operations that further increase the complexity of management operations. To reduce this complexity, Chaos Engineering can benefit from the adoption of non-destructive approaches such as the definition of realistic digital twins. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-system on which experimenting with management configurations. This paper embraces this research avenue by extending our previous efforts to integrate Chaos Engineering techniques into an IT services management framework called ChaosTwin. ChaosTwin leverages novel methodologies and tools capable of identifying and promptly react to unexpected failures. Finally, to implement autonomous fault management, ChaosTwin defines scaling and migration policies that can quickly explore for more resilient placements of software components in case of system failures. We believe that ChaosTwin can provide useful guidance to service providers in finding cost-effective service configurations capable of minimizing the negative effects of unpredictable events.},

  abstract={With the development of cutting-edge technologies and the efforts of business giants, Metaverse is becoming increasingly reachable. In addition to the fields of healthcare, education and cultural tourism, Metaverse will also have a profound impact on the power grid. The digital twin (DT) is regarded as the foundation of Metaverse, but its high cost hinders the broad application of DTs in power grids. In this paper, we propose a path to build the DTs in the direct current (DC) microgrid, which is a representative block in the future power grid with the penetration of renewable energy sources, forming Grid-Metaverse that can significantly reduce the cost and improve the interactivity. A model-based DT, which is originated from the physical model, and a data-driven DT, using the graph neural network with the data from the model-based one, are built together to illustrate this path and to show their roles in the Grid-Metaverse. Moreover, in the prototype tests, the threats of denial-of-service (DoS) and false data injection (FDI) attacks are validated through the developed DTs.},

  abstract={Cities have circumvented privacy norms and deployed sensors to track vehicles via toll transponders (like E-Zpass tags). The ethical problems regarding these practices have been highlighted by various privacy advocacy groups. The industry, however, has yet to implement a standard privacy protection regime to protect users’ data. Furthermore, existing risk management models do not adequately address user-controlled data-sharing requirements. In this article, we consider the challenges of protecting private data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and mobile edge networks. Specifically, we present a privacy risk reduction model for electronic toll transponder data. We seek to preserve driver privacy while contributing to intelligent transportation infrastructure congestion automation schemes. We thus propose TollsOnly, a fully homomorphic encryption protocol. TollsOnly is expected to be a postquantum privacy preservation scheme. It enables users to share specific data with smart cities via blockchain technology. TollsOnly protects driver privacy in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act.},

  abstract={The European interconnected grid is an association of all transmission system operators from Europe and enables a stable grid frequency and high security of supply. Due to the increasing share of volatile, decentralised renewable energies and the promotion of electromobility, the grid operators of the transmission and distribution grids are facing new challenges among others in the operational management of the electrical grid. To be able to train future engineers and students for this challenging grid operation and to train employees of grid operators, practical, realistic experience is essential in addition to theoretical knowledge. Since incorrect switching operations on the real grid can have serious consequences, it is necessary to set up a simulation of a grid control station for this purpose. Current service providers train employees in special simulators. However, the use of these simulators is strictly limited to fixed dates. In addition, the participation of prospective engineers as students is often not accessible due to the high costs involved in theses training sessions. Therefore, this paper describes a grid control station in virtual reality. Real grids are represented as a digital twin and are integrated into the virtual reality control station. However, the coupling of these two components currently exists only as a concept but will be realised soon. The participants immerse into the virtual grid control station, perform switching actions in different scenarios, and experience the consequences of their actions to increase their practical knowledge in grid operations to face the future grid challenges. The VR grid control station is to be offered as an education opportunity in the field of power engineering at Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.},

  abstract={Unnamed Ariel Vehicle-assisted-Internet of Things (UAV-assisted IoT) applications have emerged as a powerful integrated technology, showcasing remarkable results in many domains with numerous advantages. However, this technology encounters several challenges, and security is one of them. Given that, authentication and verification of legitimate devices with data privacy pose key concerns in a wireless communication environment. Even though, the literature highlights the growing security threats of this technology, where attackers can easily compromise the existing authentication and data preservation schemes. Therefore, it is crucial for all involved stakeholders to address these concerns using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as they offer cost-effective solutions. While some algorithms have been used in the literature to accurately and effectively predict, detect, and prevent vulnerabilities in this technology, they may not adequately handle modern or advanced security threats. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing literature from 2014 to 2022, specifically focusing on AI, ML, DL, and RL-enabled prototypes. Our goal is to highlight the contributions and limitations of the considered articles. Based on our observations, we will emphasize on the open challenges to set the stage for future research to enhance the security of this emerging technology. Moreover, to bridge this gap of all aspects of this technology, we will discuss layer-wise security threats and countermeasure schemes following the TCP/IP stack. Finally, we will compare our work with existing review articles to demonstrate its novelty, uniqueness, and potential usefulness for the people working in this field.},

  abstract={Brain simulation, as one of the latest advances in artificial intelligence, facilitates better understanding about how information is represented and processed in the brain. The extreme complexity of the human brain makes brain simulations only feasible on high-performance computing platforms. Supercomputers with a large number of interconnected graphical processing units (GPUs) are currently employed for supporting brain simulations. Therefore, high-throughput low-latency inter-GPU communications in super-computers play a crucial role in meeting the performance requirements of brain simulation as a highly time-sensitive application. In this article, we first provide an overview of the current parallelizing technologies for brain simulations using multi-GPU architectures. Then we analyze the challenges to communications for brain simulation and summarize guidelines for communication design to address such challenges. Furthermore, we propose a partitioning algorithm and a two-level routing method to achieve efficient low-latency communications in multi-GPU architecture for brain simulation. We report experiment results obtained on a supercomputer with 2000 GPUs for simulating a brain model with 10 billion neurons (digital twin brain, DTB) to show that our approach can significantly improve communication performance. We also discuss open issues and identify some research directions for low-latency communication design for brain simulations.},

  abstract={The digitisation of industry provides a plethora of novel applications that increase flexibility and reduce setup and maintenance time as well as cost. Furthermore, novel use cases are created by the digitisation of industry, commonly known as Industry 4.0 or the Industrial Internet of Things, applications make use of communication and computation technology that is becoming available. This enables novel business use cases, such as the digital twin, customer individual production, and data market places. However, the inter-connectivity such use cases rely on also significantly increases the attack surface of industrial enterprises. Sabotage and espionage are aimed at data, which is becoming the most crucial asset of an enterprise. Since the requirements on security solutions in industrial networks are inherently different from office networks, novel approaches for intrusion detection need to be developed. In this work, process data of a real water treatment process that contains attacks is analysed. Analysis is performed by an extension of Matrix Profiles, a motif discovery algorithm for time series. By extending Matrix Profiles with a Hamming-distance metric, binary and tertiary actuators can be integrated into the analysis in a meaningful fashion. This algorithm requires low training effort while providing accurate results. Furthermore, it can be employed in a real-time fashion. Selected actuators in the data set are analysed to highlight the applicability of the extended Matrix Profiles.},

  abstract={With the Internet of Things (IoT) development, the Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) has been introduced to enable smart services by connecting devices in underwater environments. Therefore, the UIoT has been one of the important topics of standardization in Subcommittee 41 in Joint Technical Committee 1 under the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41). This paper reviews and informs the IoT community on the UIoT activities in the recently established Working Group 7 (WG7) in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41, named “Maritime, Underwater IoT and Digital Twin Applications.” This paper then discusses standardization strategies for UIoT reference architecture (UIoT RA). The UIoT RA is the foundational system structure for future underwater technical and application standard development in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 41/WG7.},
