  abstract={Smart healthcare aims to revolutionize med-ical services by integrating artificial intelligence (AI). The limitations of classical machine learning include privacy concerns that prevent direct data sharing among medical institutions, untimely updates, and long training times. To address these issues, this study proposes a digital twin-assisted quantum federated learning algorithm (DTQFL). By leveraging the 5G mobile network, digital twins (DT) of patients can be created instantly using data from various Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and simultane-ously reduce communication time in federated learning (FL) at the same time. DTQFL generates DT for patients with specific diseases, allowing for synchronous training and updating of the variational quantum neural network (VQNN) without disrupting the VQNN in the real world. This study utilized DTQFL to train its own personalized VQNN for each hospital, considering privacy security and training speed. Simultaneously, the personalized VQNN of each hospital was obtained through further local iterations of the final global parameters. The results indicate that DTQFL can train a good VQNN without collecting local data while achieving accuracy comparable to that of data-centralized algorithms. In addition, after personalized train-ing, the VQNN can achieve higher accuracy than that with-out personalized training.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Electrical safety is a critical aspect in design, operation and maintenance of all electrical installations. From planning stage, it is necessary to strictly adhere to the regulations that provide for the complete safety of the installation and to establish an adequate maintenance plan for the duration of its life. However, there are unpredictable situations, such as faults, that can potentially risk the safety of people and equipment installation, leading in some extreme cases to major incidents such as blackouts and fires. The digitalization is leading to huge benefits in every application area, and electrical safety is one of the aspects that could gain the greatest advantage from it. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) and Digital Twins can make a great contribution to increase the electrical safety and lifetime of the elements that constitute an MV-LV electrical substation. At first, the concepts of 3d modeling characteristic of BIM and how it in most installations it's is merely a static model that provides predefined and immutable information will be introduced. Such a model, which may be a valid reference for architectural installations, is not so valid in engineering ones, where the parameters that constitute the installation are changeable and iridescent. For this reason, it is possible to combine BIM with a supervision and control system (SCADA), so as to rise a dynamic digital twin, which is much more useful for purposes such as monitoring and security of the entire plant. The case study proposed will highlight this aspect, showing the strengths of the project and the innovation of the proposed model compared to the current state of art. This paper is an extended version of the conference poster presentation 2023 Electrical Safety Workshop.},

Currently, no effective assessment approach can deduce a situation and determine the optimal response strategy when a natural disaster occurs. In this study, we propose a social evolution modeling approach and construct a deduction model for self-playing, self-learning, and self-upgrading on the basis of the idea of parallel data and reinforcement learning. The proposed approach can evaluate the impact of an event, deduce the situation, and provide optimal strategies for decision-making. Taking the breakage of a submarine cable caused by earthquake as an example, we find that the proposed modeling approach can obtain a higher reward compared with other existing methods.},

  abstract={Recent ransomware attacks (e.g., Colonial and JBS) caused significant social and economic impact due to their ability to shut down entire businesses. A functional model divides next-generation malware (NG-malware) attacks into 3 stages: Penetration (to gain a foothold), Propagation (to gain full control of target system), and a variety of Exploitation methods. The functional model shows that many attack methods and tools can be flexibly combined to bypass implementation-specific defenses at each stage, with the most important defense battleground being the prevention of NG-malware gaining full control of target system. Given the potential for further evolution of MG-malware, e.g., obfuscation of lateral movement jobs to increase both the speed and stealth of Propagation, it is crucial for the defense to develop effective defenses to detect NG-malware Propagation before ceding full control. An experimental platform that enables detailed evaluation of new NG-malware attacks and defenses is an effective tool in the battle for full control.},

  abstract={Modern technological industries fused with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) have been advancing rapidly. The joint usage of several technologies has led to the reshaping of the modeling and simulation techniques into the virtualization of physical systems. Thus, the concept of virtual prototyping has emerged as a significant development in distributed IoT applications that includes early exploration, optimization, and security assessments. Several industries have been employing various types of prototyping e.g., virtual platforms, digital twins, and application-specific virtualization techniques, to achieve individual needs for development. In this survey, we clarify some of these concepts and the distinctions between them, provide a comprehensive overview of various prototyping technologies, and discuss how several virtualization technologies play a transformative role in the design and operation of intelligent cyber-physical systems.},

Due to the dense structure, compact equipment and narrow space of automatic warehouse, on-site training is difficult to observe and learn, and easy to bring loss of life and property due to illegal operation. In order to solve these problems and enable trainers to master related technologies faster, an automatic warehouse simulation training system based on virtual reality is created. This training system uses the handle and head-mounted virtual reality display as the human-computer interaction window to realize learning and roaming in the full virtual scene. It is verified by experiments that the SUS score of the system is 78, which is within the acceptable range, the System Usability performance reaches about 80%, and the usability rating is between Good and Excellent. In addition, the SSQ score is 14.4 points, which is at a relatively low level. In a word, this system simulates the real environment of automatic warehouse, improves the learning flexibility, security, and training efficiency of trainees through virtual training and has good usability.},

  abstract={Typical transactions in cross-company Industry 4.0 supply chains require a dynamically evaluable form of trustworthiness. Therefore, specific requirements on the parties involved, down to the machine level, for automatically verifiable operations shall facilitate the realization of the economic advantages of future flexible process chains in production. The core of the paper is a modular and extensible model for the assessment of trustworthiness in industrial IoT based on the Industrial Internet Security Framework of the Industrial Internet Consortium, which among other things defines five trustworthiness key characteristics of NIST. This is the starting point for a flexible model, which contains features as discussed in ISO/IEC JTC 1/AG 7 N51 or trustworthiness profiles as used in regulatory requirements.Specific minimum and maximum requirement parameters define the range of trustworthy operation. An automated calculation of trustworthiness in a dynamic environment based on an initial trust metric is presented. The evaluation can be device-based, connection-based, behaviour-based and context-based and thus become part of measurable, trustworthy, monitorable Industry 4.0 scenarios.Finally, the dynamic evaluation of automatable trust models of industrial components is illustrated based on the Multi-Vendor-Industry of the Horizon 2020 project SecureIoT.

Therefore, a reliable, sustainable, and efficient approach is required for the entire life-cycle of satellite network operations. This paper provides a timely response to the new challenges and proposes a novel approach called “SatAIOps” as an overall solution.

This study aims to shed light on the barriers for the DSOs digitalisation process. We develop a conceptual framework that systematically links perceived or observed barriers to digital technologies and DSOs core functionalities. We identify six DSOs core functionalities that need to be improved by means of digital investments and map key implementation barriers building on a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary literature review. This cross-featuring sheds new light on the nature of best practices that can alleviate digitalisation barriers associated with various DSOs functionalities.},

  abstract={6G envisions new services such as holographic communications, virtual reality, digital twins, fiber on the sky, augmented reality to name a few of them. These new services will require a large capacity and so, they will be allocated in very high frequency bands, e.g., mmWave, TeraHertz, as well as the optical ones (i.e., fiber and optical wireless). Thus, it is foreseen that 6G will combine free-space optic (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) bands to offer more capacity, resilience to channel impairments and security (e.g. quantum and post-quantum-based security). This paper provides analysis and results on the throughput, and outage probability for the capacity, resilient, and security architectures of hybrid optical-radio systems. For more accuracy, this paper assumes that the optical and radio links have atmospheric impairments–in the optical link, there is a strong turbulence modelled using Gamma-Gamma distribution, whereas in the radio link, there is a fading modelled using Nakagami-m distribution.},

  abstract={For virtual private network and LAN-to-LAN tunnel sessions, End-to-End security is the main constraint in private messaging scenarios. Internet Protocol Security can negotiate new keys for every communication, but when the key is compromised, it is a problem. Perfect Forward Secrecy is the resolution. In addition, the messaging scheme should be efficient and lightweight for keeping parity with daily needs. The popular Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cipher is omnipresent in secure communications but has many scientific problems. So here, in this paper, a lightweight and efficient Secure Hybrid RSA (SHRSA) messaging scheme with four-layered authentication stack is implemented and analyzed. The scheme is resolving the problem of asymptotic very low speed of decryption of RSA, the computational modular exponentiation complexity and partial key exposure vulnerability issues of RSA, and many more. The four-layered authentication stack have eliminated the need of the use of any password, external digital certificates, and a third party for authentication with its own four techniques in a staked way. We have found that in evolutions and analysis of the scheme, it is not only resolving various scientific problems of RSA but also occupying 2%-4% less CPU than main RSA and occupying 1%-3% less memory than main RSA. Its decryption average time has gained 8.858 times compared to the main RSA and gained 2.248 times compared to CRT RSA. We have found that the RSA, CRT-RSA, and SHRSA's encryption throughput are alike-all are around 6 KB/Sec but decryption throughput of SHRSA has gained 8.5345 times than main RSA and gained 2.1174 times than CRT-RSA. The results obtained have shown us the relevancies of the SHRSA messaging scheme to be integratable as a cipher in Blockchain architectures, cyber-physical systems, and the Internet of Everything.},

  abstract={At present, the transition from the traditional scheme of energy supply organization to new technologies and practices, implying decentralization, digitalization and intellectualization systems of energy-saving with the active involvement of consumers in the generation and management of all types of energy resources, is becoming increasingly relevant. According to forecasts of experts given in the study “Distributed energy in Russia: potential for development”, the architecture of a distributed energy (DE) system being created will include the following elements: manageable interfaces, “routers of energy”, and platforms of management and services. Most of the platform solutions being created include only a part of the elements from the list above. Existing solutions in the field of DE are based on algorithms that do not provide the flexibility of decision-making and the proper level of security. The purpose of our work is to develop the concept of the intelligent management system of DE facilities. The principle of modular programming using the kernel expansion method was taken as a basis for the development of the concept. The proposed intelligent management system operates in real-time and allows implementing new algorithms and methods of control of the power system, including the management of its active elements. The subsequent development of the project includes the development of the architecture of the software platform and the implementation of the management system of DE facilities. Using the results of the work will increase the efficiency of management of DE facilities.},

Backdoors can remain hidden in neural networks for a long time, and the networks implanted with backdoors can still make correct judgments when receiving normal inputs. The most common way to implant backdoors into neural networks is to perform trigger inserting and label modifying in the training dataset so that the trained models naturally carry backdoors. This paper proposes a novel defense method against neural network backdoor attacks, referred to as the backdoor filter. The defense is deployed on the dataset used for model training: It first blurs the dataset images and then performs sharpening operations on the obtained processed intermediate parts. This processed dataset is then used as input to the neural network for model training. We use three different types of backdoor attacks to validate our approach, evaluating the prediction accuracy and the attack's success rate after our processing. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the success rate of the corresponding attacks and effectively defend against backdoor attacks.},

  abstract={In cooperative, connected, and automated mobility (CCAM), the more automated vehicles can perceive, model, and analyze the surrounding environment, the more they become aware and capable of understanding, making decisions, as well as safely and efficiently executing complex driving scenarios. High-definition (HD) maps represent the road environment with unprecedented centimetre-level precision with lane-level semantic information, making them a core component in smart mobility systems, and a key enabler for CCAM technology. These maps provide automated vehicles with a strong prior to understand the surrounding environment. An HD map is also considered as a hidden or virtual sensor, since it aggregates knowledge (mapping) from physical sensors, i.e., LiDAR, camera, GPS and IMU to build a model of the road environment. Maps for automated vehicles are quickly evolving towards a holistic representation of the digital infrastructure of smart cities to include not only road geometry and semantic information, but also live perception of road participants, updates on weather conditions, work zones and accidents. Deployment of autonomous vehicles at a large scale necessitates building and maintaining these maps by a large fleet of vehicles which work cooperatively to continuously keep maps up-to-date for autonomous vehicles in the fleet to function properly. This article provides an extensive review of the various applications of these maps in highly autonomous driving (AD) systems. We review the state-of-the-art of the different approaches and algorithms to build and maintain HD maps. Furthermore, we discuss and synthesise data, communication and infrastructure requirements for the distribution of HD maps. Finally, we review the current challenges and discuss future research directions for the next generation of digital mapping systems.},

  year={2023},
  volume={41},
  number={10},
  pages={3293-3305},
  abstract={With rapid development of emerging technologies for Internet of Things (IoT), digital twins (DT) have been proposed to support a wide variety of applications. A mobile network is expected to be integrated with DT to form a DT mobile network (DTMN). Unfortunately, DTMN still faces security threats, which have attracted great research attention. Current defense mechanisms are mostly static, i.e., responding after attacks happening. To solve the aforementioned problem, moving target defense (MTD) has been proposed as an innovative solution. However, there exist three major challenges when applying MTD into DTMN. Firstly, less emphasis was paid to collaborative scheduling between multiple MTD schemes, which can improve the security of DTMN. Secondly, MTD schemes require lots of network resources, but few works focus on the time allocation of multiple MTD schemes to reduce network resource consumption. Thirdly, existing defense strategies only rely on current information, but do not consider future information. In this paper, we propose a collaborative mutation-based MTD (CM-MTD) in DTMN. We mainly consider two MTD schemes called host address mutation (HAM) and route mutation (RM), respectively, which adjust network properties and invalidate different stages of cyber kill chain. We firstly formulate a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) to model time-varying security events and dynamic deployment of multiple MTD schemes. Then, security events are predicted by long short-term memory (LSTM), which are regarded as network states in SMDP. Next, infeasible actions that do not satisfy network constraints will be removed from the action space of the SMDP. Lastly, we design a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm for collaborative scheduling. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CM-MTD compared with baseline solutions.},

  abstract={Digital Twins (DTs) have been proposed as digital replicas of physical entities (e.g., manufacturing plants), which one can observe and interact with, e.g., to perform what-if analysis. In this paper, we argue that mobile networks need DTs as well, and network simulators appear to be promising candidates to fulfill that role. We discuss the challenges that need be addressed to make this happen, e.g., centralized vs. distributed implementation, gathering input from the physical network, security issues and hosting, and the possibilities offered by network simulation in terms of what-if analysis, defining the concepts of lockstep and branching analysis. We exemplify the above concepts using Simu5G, a popular 5G/B5G simulation library for OMNeT++, as a reference case study.},

  title={Digital Twin-Based Cyber-Attack Detection Framework for Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-18},
  abstract={Smart manufacturing (SM) systems utilize run-time data to improve productivity via intelligent decision-making and analysis mechanisms on both machine and system levels. The increased adoption of cyber-physical systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor. Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products, or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising solution for providing additional insights into the physical process (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work, we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection. Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints. We utilize a model predictive controller on an off-the-shelf 3D printer to run the process, and stage anomalies and cyber-attacks that are successfully detected by the proposed framework.},

Smart Factory, in the context of Industry 4.0 and the IoT, is currently one of the most discussed topics in industrial manufacturing research. Scholars agree that the implementation of Smart Factory leads to the creation of value. We identify a research gap which is related to the make-or-buy decision around some core components of the Smart Factory, especially the Digital Twin (DT). We argue that the effectiveness of value creation depends on the "way" in which Smart Factory is implemented. Firms are required to decide if an implementation project will be executed in-house or through external supplier. In addition, we analysed the research gap through the theoretical lens of Transaction Costs Economics (TCE).},

In order to successfully master new demands, new technologies and alternative business models are needed. Those technologies have to be integrated into Industry 4.0, in particularly Car Industry 4.0. One of these new technologies is DLT. This paper proposes the usage of DLT in an essential part of a Car Industry: its production.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the manufacturing process in the industry. It has created a new ecosystem allowing a diversified set of devices to be controlled remotely with minimal human intervention. Today, with the advances in intelligence, processing, storage, communication, and networking capabilities of IoT devices, we are one step closer to realizing the vision of Industry 4.0. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are now significantly more intelligent and automated with the aid of advances in Machine Learning (ML). Intelligent IoT (IIoT), Digital Twins (DT) and the advances in mobile networks are now paving the path towards decentralized self-managed CPS in the industry. DT permits mobile networks to provide adaptive and dynamic configurations for cooperative CPS. Moreover, trustworthy cooperation may be realized with blockchain. In this article, we present a blockchain-assisted hierarchical federated learning (FL)-enabled platform (HFL) for Industry 4.0. The solution integrates DT into CPS to accurately capture the characteristics of industrial IoT devices and assist in the HFL process. A two-stage FL algorithm is used that groups Internet-enabled factory machinery and their DTs into groups in accordance with their organizational structure. A global model is created for the groups from the averaged local models and the DT model in the first stage. During the second stage, federated aggregation is used to create a global model from the first-stage models. Blockchain is used to cross-verify and validate newly added blocks with the support of validator nodes. Numerical analysis is performed to compare between the presented DT-enabled and blockchain-assisted HFL solution and benchmark solutions in terms of network overhead, block optimization, and accuracy.},

  abstract={The Metaverse, a 3-dimensional virtual realm mirroring real-world objects, promises transformative experiences. Its potential is tempered by data collection, confidentiality, and privacy concerns. In tandem with AI-enabled technologies, edge computing can provide a practical solution to overcoming many of these challenges. This paper argues that combining AI-enabled technologies with edge computing-specifically via federated learning (FL) can address these challenges. FL, as a privacy-centric distributed machine learning (ML) approach, enables knowledge sharing among Metaverse clients without compromising user data. However, while FL posits potential resolutions for the Metaverse, a discernible lacuna remains in the comprehensive study of its overarching consequences. The literature misses an extensive study of adopting these new deployment architectures, giving it significant research impact. This paper bridges this knowledge gap, exploring the symbiosis between the Metaverse and FL. We first introduce the foundational concepts of both domains and detail enabling technologies such as digital twins, the Internet of Things, brain-computer interfaces, blockchain, and extended reality. Next, we delve into practical applications of FL within the metaverse, spanning sectors like healthcare, education, e-commerce, gaming, and the military. Finally, the paper highlights the key challenges and future directions for integrating FL within the metaverse ecosystem.},

  abstract={Monitoring and life cycle management of industrial plants and their devices is a crucial task to avoid plant downtimes and safety risks. The emergence of Edge Computing allows monitoring applications to be deployed close to the devices, benefiting from a minimum response time, but also adhering to strong privacy policies. At the same time, life cycle management applications need to involve information from multiple parties, e.g., the device vendor, the operator, and maintenance staff. Thus, information needs to be processed in a standardized format so that it can be exchanged across company borders. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) serves as such a standardized information modeling and exchange format in Industry 4.0. This paper discusses use cases that benefit from a deployment of an AAS infrastructure on edge computing devices. We collected and analyzed use cases around device monitoring and management from recent sources in the industrial context and discuss how our vision of "AAS on the edge" enables these use cases. Furthermore, we list open challenges that currently hinder the successful implementation of these use cases in practice.},

MTConnect provides a standard solution to collect consistent data from various machines and devices. The current MTConnect applications are based on a single computer which is not suitable to collect large-scale MTConnect data. Cloud computing technology can handle this issue easily such as Apache NiFi.

In European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been enforced since 2018, aiming to protect a person's privacy. However, the growth of the data economy might be hindered due to the lack of a trusted, secure and privacy-aware tool. Motivated by this observation, this work presents Data Vaults - a secure, distributed and privacy-preserving personal data management platform. The main goal is to mitigate various privacy concerns through allowing an individual to maintain the ownership, handle and share the data based on their willingness. The platform enables a flexible data sharing method with fair compensation schemes. In particular, with the Data Vaults platform, an individual can protect the sharing of personal data and fairly define how value can be captured, created, released and cashed out for the benefit of all the stakeholders involved (companies or not).},

On the basis of the connotation and technical characteristics of digital distribution networks, the path and initiatives for implementing whole life cycle management are further elaborated, focusing on the functional requirements of each key business module of the whole life cycle, including the whole process from planning and design to decommissioning and end-of-life. Finally, the importance of the harmonised coding process in the full lifecycle of assets is emphasised.},

  abstract={The simulation of a modern railway system on the cyber range will investigate the supple behavior of cyber-attacks in a modern digital railway system. The contemporary digital railway simulation architecture will focus on the railway's signaling system and the control command system, which is a classic SCADA system. With the introduction of IoT technology to railway systems, they have become vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The simulation is conducted on the cyber range server by simulating STCS. The cyber threats will be analyzed through penetration testing using Kali Linux on the simulated STCS on the cyber range. We analyze the impact of the threat agent groups, especially denial of service (DoS) and quay chain attacks that mainly target the STCS. The DoS attack generates the congestion of packets in the railway system network and will compromise the SCADA components in the STCS. The quay chain attack compromises the SCADA component, resulting in a delay in the signal system of STCS. The attack tree analysis helps us to understand the behavior of threat agents on STCS. Based on the research, we identified some mitigation techniques to reduce the cyber-attacks impact on the modern digital railway system.},

SBA Research, Software Competence Center Hagenberg, and VRVis Zentrum fuer Virtual Reality und Visualisierung, all funded by the Austrian COMET Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies program, each selected one science–industry partnership to exemplify how they do TCS in their day-to-day work. We show how the COMET funding program provides a framework for establishing long-term research relationships with industry, thus facilitating TCS: research done by the COMET centers is directly put in the practical context of the industry partners, and successes and failures are immediately reported back. This constant feedback loop positively impacts the know-how at the involved companies, while allowing the computer scientists to continuously test, improve, and publish their research based on real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is not a technology, but a system concept that incorporates multiple technologies. These include, for instance, cloud computing, distributed computing, Big Data, AI and digital twins. IoT systems are by nature data intensive, network centric and distributed. Some are cyberphysical in nature. The IoT is also an enabler of what is commonly referred to as ‘smart everything’. This paper describes the strategic approach taken by ISO/IEC JTC 1 Subcommittee 41 (SC41) in IoT standardization since its creation more than five years. This strategy puts an emphasis on the development of foundational standards and collaborative work with both developers of some technology standards and stakeholders in sectors where the IoT enables ‘smartness’.},

The term cloudlets was introduced first in 2011, but research in this area has picked up only over the past couple of years. In this paper, we propose a complete novel distributed architecture for cloudlets, and also we are proposing algorithms for data storage and task allocation across various nodes in the cloud. This cloudlet system was built using Qualcomm Snapdragon 410c. We have analyzed the architecture and the algorithm for varying workloads, bandwidth and data storage. The primary aim of the algorithm and the architecture is to ensure uniform processing and data loads across the nodes of the system.},

In this study, a cold chain digital twins-based risk analysis model is constructed to handle and monitor the vaccine delivery process with a high level of reliability and traceability. The model integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital twins to acquire data on environmental conditions and shipment movements and connect physical cold chain logistics to the digital world. Through the simulation of cold chain logistics in a virtual environment, the risk levels relating to physical operations at a certain forecast horizon can be predicted beforehand, to prevent a “broken” cold chain. The result of this investigation will reshape the cold chain in the digital age, benefit society in terms of sustainability and environmental impact, and hence contribute to the development of cold chain logistics in Hong Kong.},

  abstract={Research on autonomous management for large-scale deployments of constrained devices is still a maturing field in the Internet of Things (IoT). Although much research has been conducted on how to achieve autonomous management in specific cases, there is a need for literature investigating which mechanisms can achieve such behavior in a generalized way. In this review, we present a comprehensive and structured study of the mechanisms for autonomous device management of constrained IoT devices in the light of management tasks, operational environment, network topology, resource constraints, scalability and management categories. Data extracted from 32 relevant cases are first organized and analyzed according to a synthesized taxonomy of observed adaptation mechanisms, and then combined with the state-of-the-art models of autonomous operations, identifying common patterns for autonomous management. Based on our findings we substantiate best practices for designing and implementing solutions around adaptation mechanisms. We then present a generalized model for autonomous device management that describes and explains the processes required for autonomous operation, unifying the insights from previous works as one cohesive archetype.},

  abstract={There is an increasing demand for operational uses of machine learning (ML), however, a lack of best practices for test and evaluation (T &E) of learning systems is a hindrance to supply. This manuscript proposes a new framework for best practices, described as T &E harnesses, that corresponds principally to the task of engineering a learning system-in contrast to the status quo task of solving a learning problem. The primary difference is a question of scope. This manuscript places T &E for ML into the broader scope of systems engineering processes. Importantly, two challenge problems, acquisition and operations, are used to motivate the use of T &E harnesses for learning systems. This manuscript draws from recent findings in experimental design for ML, combinatorial interaction testing of ML solutions, and the general systems modeling of ML. The concept of T &E harnesses is closely tied to existing models of systems engineering processes. We draw the conclusion that existing best practices for T &E form a subset of what is needed to rigorously test for system-level satisfaction of stakeholder needs.},

  abstract={In modern industry, adaptation to market changes, as well as prompt reaction to a variety of predictable and unpredictable events, is a key requirement. Ubiquitous computing, real-time analytics, reconfigurable hardware/software components, often coexist in the complex, internally variegated, and often proprietary systems that are traditionally deployed to meet such requirement. However, such tailor-made systems meet only in part the requirements of openness, security, monitorability, geographical distribution, and most of all, remote extendability and changeability, which are crucial for prompt reaction to unforeseen circumstances. In this work, a containerized service application named Network Factory is presented. It enables the remote construction, configuration and operation of resilient computation systems that meet the above-mentioned requirements, and distinguish for their logical simplicity and for the uniform addressing of elaborations and human-computer interfaces, which are achieved through few reconfigurable components and communication mechanisms that are used from the production line up to the Cloud.

  abstract={Integrated and collaborative manufacturing system develops as massive data are obtained by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, the “trust tax” imposed on manufacturers during their countless collaborations with customers, suppliers, distributors, governments, service providers, and other manufacturers is very high. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can lead to more transparent, secure, and efficient transactions. It represents a new paradigm, as well as new thinking, of how data can be securely stored, integrated, and communicated among different stakeholders, organizations, and systems that unnecessarily trust each other. Blockchain is greatly useful for reducing the “trust tax,” especially beneficial for the small- and medium-sized enterprises that must tolerate much heavier trust tax than the established manufacturers. This paper investigates the blockchain-based security and trust mechanism and elaborates a particular application of blockchain for quality assurance, which is one of the strategic priorities of smart manufacturing. Data generated in a smart manufacturing process can be leveraged to retrieve material provenance, facilitate equipment management, increase transaction efficiency, and create a flexible pricing mechanism. The dairy industry is used to instantiate the value propositions of blockchain for quality assurance.},

However, the increasing data dimensionality and volume for new metaverse applications present a significant challenge in data acquisition, security, and sharing. Furthermore, metaverse applications require high capacity and ultrareliability for the wireless system to guarantee the quality of user experience, which cannot be addressed in the current fifth-generation system. Therefore, reaching the metaverse is dependent on the revolution in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication, which is expected to provide low-latency, high-throughput, and secure services.

Even at current endemic stages, special focus on maintaining physical distancing norms for curbing the expeditious spread of the disease, many institutions, individuals and industries rely on communications networks or telecoms for ensuring service consistency to avoid complete termination of their business operations and other activities. This has put enormous pressure on mobile networks and communication systems thereby making the technology experts to think more about introducing rapid speed, vast coverage and high connectivity networks. The extensive application of fresh communication networks and enabling technologies have impelled the advent of 6G communication networks. As 6G is still in its inception phase, its complete realization requires a proper and high understanding of diverse quantitative and qualitative factors supporting its deployment. From this standpoint, this survey article intends to deeply explore 6G networks, their significance and prerequisites. This paper provides a succinct theoretical background of 6G technology, and reviews the diverse enabling technologies and existing works undertaken on core technologies. It explores the prevailing gaps in research for providing readers to gain information regarding challenges in perfect 6G network realization and implementation thus paving the road for a successful 6G vision.},

  abstract={This paper explores the objectives, tactics, and strategies for identifying, planning, conducting, and evaluating an international cyber-physical exercise (CPX). The goal of a CPX is to improve defense capabilities for defending national critical infrastructure via global coordination. Lessons about CPX have been derived from a series of annual cyber-physical defense exercises conducted since 2015, referred to as Critical Infrastructure Security Showdowns (CISS). The cyber range of a CISS consists of a realistic and operational enterprise network coupled to water treatment and distribution plants in the form of physical testbeds and digital twins. These systems simulate and integrate information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) scenarios that are ubiquitous in modern-day critical infrastructure controlled by industrial control systems (ICS). Participants from the red, blue, green, and white teams are assigned specific roles to attack, defend, visualize, and manage the plant, respectively. Each of these roles is evaluated via a specific set of metrics by a panel of judges and automated systems. The scoring criteria incentivize the red teams to design and launch novel attacks to contribute to and improve the cybersecurity community’s knowledge base regarding offense and defense. The lessons distilled from these positive-sum games are analyzed and shared in the form of post-event reports.From 2015 to 2021, CISS has constantly evolved to mimic contemporary cyber-physical security scenarios in the real world. These evolutions have forced the CISS organizing team to adapt and design novel infrastructure to support the changing needs of the event and its stakeholders, from tooling, logistics, and network infrastructure to scoring criteria and cross-disciplinary collaboration.The cited reports on techniques, tactics, and procedures will be valuable to stakeholders from the military, industry, government, and academia.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1730-1735},
  abstract={Recently, backdoor attacks pose a major security threat to deep neural networks. The attacker embeds hidden malicious behaviors into deep learning models that is activated only when the input contains specific triggers. Although backdoor attacks have a high success rate and are very stealthy, existing backdoor models often lose their attack capabilities after transfer learning. A critical question at present is how to ensure that the malicious behavior of the backdoor model is not disturbed by transfer learning. In this paper, we conducted a detailed empirical study of multiple existing backdoor defenses, and found that the existing defenses are generally based on the different recognition mechanisms of backdoor triggers and clean samples in the model. In order to resist existing defenses, we propose a method for generating backdoor triggers inversely based on the gradient information of model. In addition, for preventing the model from being disturbed by transfer learning, we use the modified Triplets-Loss to inject the backdoor only in the convolutional layer, and erase the backdoor information of the fully connected layer under the premise of ensuring the effect of the backdoor attack. Finally, we evaluate the attack and 4 potential defenses in several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB. The proposed attack method achieves 100% success rates while circumventing the interference of existing backdoor defenses.},

Second, we envision space digital twin (SDT), a novel technology that can facilitate secure and reliable satellite Internet with the ability to conduct multi-dimensional security assessment, identify various vulnerabilities, and evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures accordingly. With SDT techniques, an ISTN operator/researcher can flexibly build a virtual ISTN environment (VIE), which duplicates the network architecture, protocols, behaviors as well as security threats and vulnerabilities of a real ISTN, for security assessment and countermeasures evaluation. Finally, we conclude the key challenges of realizing the full capability of SDT, and accordingly outline a list of corresponding new directions for future research.},

  abstract={The development of vehicle networking and self-driving technology has increased the integration of communication interfaces into modern vehicles and the interaction between the connected vehicles and roadside unites. This situation also brings security threats. Controller area network (CAN) is the main bus system in modern automobiles. It easily suffers from cyberattacks because it lacks security protection mechanisms. Intrusion detection system is an effective method to defend cyberattacks. However, the detection accuracy may be affected by the change in driving environment and the occurrence of unknown attacks. A detection model based on incremental learning is used to improve detection performance. In addition, a cloud-edge collaborative architecture is designed to implement the detection model for reducing the burden of calculation and storage of on-board system and maintaining the timeliness of detection. Deep Neural Network(DNN) is applied in the offline training stage to obtain a basic classification model using marked actual CAN data. Then, the trained model is stored in the cloud server. After the edge server receives detection request from a vehicle, it will download the model from the cloud server and perform intrusion detection. At the same time, it will update the model with incremental learning technology based on new unlabeled data. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  year={2022},

  pages={2452-2459},
  abstract={In the collaborative design metaverse application, the design team as data owner(DO) has demanded to outsource the digital model to a cloud service provider(CSP) due to the limit of local storage. They also need to frequently search and update the data for improving the design. But the virtual world of metaverse is mutual distrusted, which brings 4 major security concerns: 1) CSP may partially execute the DOs’ queries and is curious about the search keywords and the outsource data, how to protect the privacy of data and queries? 2) CSP may dishonestly execute queries to save cost or under other considerations, how to protect the correctness and integrity of results? 3) How to ensure the integrity of outsourced data? 4) When there occurs disputation between DO and CSP, how to provide trusted proofs and make a fair judgment? So, we achieved a verifiable searchable encryption scheme in metaverse by blockchain(VSES-MB). Our scheme protect the data and query privacy by combining verifiable searchable encryption and blockchain. Then, we introduced trapdoor commitment and dynamic interval accumulator(DIA) tree to accelerate the proof generate speed and decrease the proof updating workload. Furthermore, data integrity was protected with the help of blockchain. Next, on the one hand, the metadata of workflow is embedded in blockchain transactions to provide trusted proof. On the other hand, smart contract of blockchain can fairly automatically judge the dispute. Finally, security analysis shows VSES-MB achieves confidentiality and soundness, performance analysis shows our scheme is efficient and easy to deploy.},

  abstract={To explore the airspace structure and safety performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system based on spatial digital twins (DTs), the study introduces DTs technology, and combines convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with UAV autonomous network. The DTs system of UAV is constructed by using wireless communication technology, and its security performance is simulated. The results show that in the analysis of the system packet loss rate, it is found that with the increase of the acquisition points, the amount of transmitted data only increases slightly, but the packet loss rate does not change significantly. In the analysis of the network performance of the unmanned aircraft system, it is found that the node energy-based weighted clustering algorithm (EWCA) can be used to increase the life of the overall network and enhance its availability by rationally controlling the number of nodes and the number of switching between clusters. As the number of nodes increases, the minimum survival time of each clustering algorithm decreases linearly. When the number of nodes is less than 600, the growth rate of cluster head is higher; When the number of nodes is more than 600, the curve growth is relatively smooth. In the analysis of the probability of network safety interruption, it is found that using the model constructed, when the energy acquisition coefficient is close to 0.5, the energy conversion efficiency is higher, the signal-to-noise ratio is larger. Also, when the number of intermediate nodes is increased to 10, the UAV has the best network safety performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the UAV DTs system constructed can significantly improve the safety performance of the UAV during its airspace flight. It can provide experimental references for the widespread application of the UAV in the later period.},

  abstract={Fine jewelry is a unique class of ornaments composed of precious metals and gemstones. Premium-grade metals such as gold, platinum, and sliver, and gemstones such as pearls, diamonds, rubies, and emeralds are used use to make fine jewelry. Paper-based certificates are typically issued by retailers and producers for fine jewelry and gemstones as a proof of origin, sale, ownership, history, and quality. However, paper certificates are subject to counterfeiting, loss, or theft. In this paper, we show how non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Ethereum blockchain can be used for digital certification, proof of ownership, sale history, and quality, as well as proof of delivery for fine jewelry and gemstones. We present the proposed system design and architecture with sequence diagrams covering key interactions for jewelry production, purchase, and sale, along with algorithms related to NFT minting, auctioning, ownership management, and physical delivery. We demonstrate that our proposed NFT and blockchain-based solution can provide superior alternative in terms of verifiability, traceability, immutability, and security when compared with paper-based certification and traditional auctioning, delivery and ownership management. We make our developed smart contracts and testing scripts publicly available on GitHub.},

  abstract={The Digital Twins (DTs) offer promising solutions for smart grid challenges related to the optimal operation, management, and control of energy assets, for safe and reliable distribution of energy. These challenges are more pressing nowadays than ever due to the large-scale adoption of distributed renewable resources at the edge of the grid. DTs are leveraging on technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing, to analyze data from different energy sensors, view and verify the status of physical energy assets and extract useful information to predict and optimize the asset’s performance. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the DTs application domains in the smart grid while analyzing existing the state-of-the-art literature. We have focused on the following application domains: energy asset modeling, fault and security diagnosis, operational optimization, and business models. Most of the relevant literature approaches found are published in the last 3 years showing that the domain of DTs application in smart grid is hot and gradually developing. Anyway, there is no unified view on the DTs implementation and integration with energy management processes, thus, much work still needs to be done to understand and automatize the smart grid management.},

  abstract={Recent technological advancements have considerably improved healthcare systems to provide various intelligent services, improving life quality. The Metaverse, often described as the next evolution of the Internet, helps the users interact with each other and the environment, thus offering a seamless connection between the virtual and physical worlds. Additionally, the Metaverse, by integrating emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and semantic communications, can potentially transform many vertical domains in general and the healthcare sector (healthcare Metaverse) in particular. The healthcare Metaverse holds huge potential to revolutionize the development of intelligent healthcare systems, thus presenting new opportunities for significant advancements in healthcare delivery, personalized healthcare experiences, medical education, collaborative research, and so on. However, various challenges are associated with the realization of the healthcare Metaverse, such as privacy, interoperability, data management, and security. Federated learning (FL), a new branch of AI, opens up enormous opportunities to deal with the aforementioned challenges in the healthcare Metaverse by exploiting the data and computing resources available at the distributed devices. This motivated us to present a survey on adopting FL for the healthcare Metaverse. Initially, we present the preliminaries of IoT-based healthcare systems, FL in conventional healthcare, and the healthcare Metaverse. Furthermore, the benefits of the FL in the healthcare Metaverse are discussed. Subsequently, we discuss the several applications of FL-enabled healthcare Metaverse, including medical diagnosis, patient monitoring, medical education, infectious disease, and drug discovery. Finally, we highlight the significant challenges and potential solutions toward realizing FL in the healthcare Metaverse.},

  abstract={When building digital twins of existing technical solutions, we need a large amount of data on the parameters of their operation under various conditions. The source of data on the values of process variables at the lowest level is control devices - most often PLCs. There are many ways to acquire the qualities of process variables available from the PLC level. Increasingly, OPC UA is replacing the OPC model, and the OPC UA server is increasingly a functionality of the PLC CPU. The Industrial Internet of Things IIoT is used in companies moving toward Factory 4.0. Data from controllers can be acquired using high-level languages such as C++, C# or Python. Libraries often made available under an open-source license are used for this. For example, you can find commercial libraries for communication between PLCs of selected manufacturers and MySQL servers. Siemens provides a library for communication between S7-1200/1500 controllers and MS SQL server. The author has yet to find an exhaustive analysis of such a solution. In the literature, there need to be more studies of experiments describing the performance of query generation and execution and the impact of the library on PLC performance.

  abstract={As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics—as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

  abstract={Over the past two years, the spread of COVID-19 has spurred the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in aid of healthcare. The need to guarantee continuity to care has promoted research and industry activities aimed at developing solutions for the digitalization of the procedures to be performed to provide health services, even in emergency scenarios. Digital collection, transmission, and processing of health data represent the starting point for fulfilling this innovation process but also bring heterogeneous challenges. These motivations led to the elaboration of this work, which analyzes innovative and technological tools for the development of digital health (eHealth) through the collection of multisectoral literature, produced thanks to the cooperation of varied research groups, thus providing a multidisciplinary survey. Since digital health is expected to be one of the leading applications of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless cellular networks, this paper covers the related telecommunications aspects. Furthermore, the exploitation of artificial intelligence paradigms to elaborate massive amounts of biological data is examined. Given the extreme sensitivity of health data, this paper also investigates security and privacy issues. In particular, the main techniques and approaches to guarantee security properties (i.e., anonymity, responsibility, authentication, confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and revocability) are studied. Applications involving innovative electromagnetic systems for healthcare and assisted living services are described to provide an example of an eHealth scenario leveraging ICT. Finally, the telemedicine-related regulations of the European Commission are analyzed, with particular reference to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).},

  abstract={This paper presents a complete solution consisting of sustainable IoT-based Reliable Industrial Data Services (RIDS) able to manage the huge amount of industrial data coming from cost-effective, smart, and small size interconnected factory devices for supporting manufacturing online monitoring and control. The i4Q Framework guarantees data reliability with functions grouped into five basic capabilities around the data cycle: sensing, communication, computing infrastructure, storage, and analysis and optimisation. With the i4Q RIDS, factories will be able to handle large amounts of data, achieving adequate levels of data accuracy, precision and traceability, using it for analysis and prediction as well as to optimise the process quality and product quality in manufacturing, leading to an integrated approach to zero-defect manufacturing. The i4Q Solutions efficiently collect the raw industrial data using cost-effective instruments and state-of-the-art communication protocols, guaranteeing data accuracy and precision, reliable traceability and time stamped data integrity through distributed ledger technology and provide simulation and optimisation tools for manufacturing line continuous process qualification, quality diagnosis, reconfiguration and certification for ensuring high manufacturing efficiency and optimal manufacturing quality.},

  abstract={There have been attempts to improve the operational efficiency of construction projects and plan response countermeasures for estimated damage following disasters through the utilization of accumulated electronic data, which constructs a digital twin that can reproduce a physical space in cyberspace and feedback the cyberspace simulation results to physical space. However, the application of such simulations is limited, unless numerical models can be automatically constructed from the data. In this study, we develop a program that utilizes a data processing platform to read, transform, and integrate data to create mediated data with a common data structure. This mediated data can be used to construct analytical models for various numerical analyses. Using the program developed, a grid model of 3-D ground surface as the mediated data was constructed based on borehole data obtained through a ground survey. Each grid point has basic material parameters of soil, and these parameters are estimated from borehole data and other investigation reports. Each grid point has general geotechnical parameters and can be easily converted to a 3-D finite-element model. When the borehole data is added or changed, the analytical model can be updated with almost no cost, whereas it would be very costly to create the model manually.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic unraveled the weak points in the global supply chain for goods. Specifically, people all over the world, including those in the most advanced nations have had to go without medical supplies and personal protective equipment. Scarcity of essentials increases anxiety and uncertainty exacerbating unproductive behaviors like hoarding and price gouging. Left to market forces, such unfair practices are likely to aggravate hardships and increase the loss of lives. Thus, there is a critical need to ensure safe distribution of food and essential supplies to all citizens to sustain them through challenging times. To this end, we propose a simple, affordable and contact-less robotic system for preparing and dispensing food and survival-kits at community scale. The system has provisions to prevent hoarding and price gouging. Design, simulation, and, validation of the system has been completed to ensure readiness for real world implementation. This project is part of an open-source program and detailed designs are available upon request to entities interested in using it to serve their communities.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) device data enables diverse applications. However, the quality of data are non-standardized and difficult to quantify. While poor quality data may be usable, establishing error bounds supports IoT’s use in critical applications. National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) have long tradition in making measurement data trustworthy, and they are now working to digitalize these practices. This paper forwards that agenda by presenting a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based concept to leverage digital metrology for IoT data and devices. Digital Calibration Certificates (DCCs) offer a solution for describing, certifying, authenticating, and securing IoT data quality. With DCCs, measurement device (sensor) calibration information may be included as metadata alongside samples captured by a device. Metadata may include device identification, which serves as proof-of-origin for measurements and samples, and timing data, to ensure its “freshness.” DCCs enhance communicating the quality of captured information among devices, services, and applications, thereby supporting IoT’s use in domains with strict error constraints. Our proposed concept securely validates DCC-based (meta)data traceability chain from NMIs and devices to data end-users with cryptographic measures, rendering IoT data trustworthy for critical applications.},

  abstract={While the increasing penetration of information and communication technology into distribution grid brings numerous benefits, it also opens up a new threat landscape, particularly through cyberattacks. To provide a basis for countermeasures against such threats, this paper addresses the investigation of the impact and manifestations of cyberattacks on smart grids by replicating the power grid in a secure, isolated, and controlled laboratory environment as a cyber-physical twin. Currently, detecting intrusions by unauthorized third parties into the central monitoring and control system of grid operators, especially attacks within the grid perimeter, is a major challenge. The development and validation of methods to detect and prevent coordinated and timed attacks on electric power systems depends not only on the availability and quality of data from such attack scenarios, but also on suitable realistic investigation environments. However, to create a comprehensive investigation environment, a realistic representation of the study object is required to thoroughly investigate critical cyberattacks on grid operations and evaluate their impact on the power grid using real data. In this paper, we demonstrate our cyber-physical twin approach using a microgrid in the context of a cyberattack case study.},

  abstract={The paper shows the process of developing a model of multistage evaporator station of a sugar factory based on a neural network. The neural network predicts the main performance indicators of the multistage evaporator station, such as the concentration of syrup at the output of the evaporator and the amount of evaporated water at the station. Unlike existing solutions, forecasting is performed in real time based on a set of indicators of the automation system (temperatures, flow rates, levels, pressure, density in the apparatus) and industrial laboratory (concentration of solids at the inlet to the evaporation station). The proposed neural network model has an MLP structure with 27 inputs, 2 outputs and one hidden layer with 20 neurons and predicts these indicators with an error of less than 5%. This allows to increase the informative support of the operator-technologist on the quality indicators of the enterprise without additional load on the industrial laboratory and without additional cost automatic quality devices, as well as to perform timely adjustment of the technological mode of the department.},

  abstract={The fourth industrial revolution, also termed Industry 4.0 (I4.0), will digitalize manufacturing operations and decentralize them from the shop floor to the office and across entire enterprise networks [1]. The proposed system-level digitalization solutions for I4.0 include cyber-physical systems [2] and digital twins [3]. Standardized I4.0 technologies are urgently required to change industry and guide market usage. The asset administration shell (AAS) of the I4.0 component [4] is a German symbolic model that is under development as an international standard in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) project 63278-1. Not all engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs have a basic knowledge of the AAS. Very few understand how to employ an AAS in practice. This article uses AASs to implement an I4.0 scenario, thus plug and produce (PnP) of industrial field devices. A three-layer, AAS-based implementation of PnP manufacture in line with I4.0 is developed. The synergy is to show that the AAS may help expedite I4.0 digitalization and propel its applications forward.},

  abstract={With the continuous innovation of new-generation information technology and its accelerated integration with manufacturing industry, industrial internet platforms (IIPs) are rapidly emerging worldwide. Construction and application of IIP has become a new focus in international competition for leading enterprises, and also a new direction of industrial development for many countries worldwide. However, the development of IIP is still in the stage of exploration, and the industry sector still lacks unified understanding of the IIP. Therefore, this study firstly proposes a reference architecture of IIP to clarify its framework and core functions, so as to provide a general reference model for the industry to understand and jointly promote construction of IIP. Secondly, an assessment system is proposed to evaluate the usage of IIP. The assessment framework is composed from three domains namely the foundation, key capability, value and benefit. Finally, the practical value of the reference architecture and the assessment framework of IIP is verified by an industry practice.},

  abstract={During the ramp-up of a production system, complex and difficult to resolve product quality issues often result in tedious experimentation and costly delays. A particular challenge in this context is insufficient guidance for operators on how to resolve issues and adapt their actions to a new production context. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can help to identify and address likely causes of production quality issues. However, FMEA models are typically (i) isolated from engineering domain models on product, process and resource (PPR) concerns, and (ii) not actionable for operators. This paper introduces the FMEA-to-Operation (F2O) approach to reduce the risk of ramp-up delays and recurring quality issues by integrating the required domain knowledge for model-driven, machine skill-centric, and actionable process FMEA. The F2O approach (i) validates likely root causes of a production quality issue by linking these causes to engineering reality in a graph database, and (ii) derives operation checklists with prioritized countermeasures. In a feasibility study on a real-world welding cell for car parts, we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the F2O approach. Results indicate that the F2O approach is feasible and effective, and provides operators with actionable, context-specific guidelines that are well grounded in engineering models.},

  abstract={The flexibility and performance of digital laboratory elements such as remote labs, VR/AR or simulations summarized under the term cross-reality labs (CrossLabs), can be seen with the development in last and has been proven under the pandemic situation. Even though the potential of cross-reality labs is obvious referring to availability and flexibility for the students, these didactic solutions remain isolated at universities as well as for individual users. The implementations are mostly so rigid that the individual didactic objectives are not interchangeable between different universities and disciplines, hence there is a lack of interoperability. The CrossLab project seeks to design didactical, technical, and organizational solutions for open digital lab objects linking student-centered teaching and a cross-university learning environment. Of importance thereby is the fact that teaching is not adaptable to the digital laboratory, but the laboratories are adaptable to the requirements of the teaching-learning setting. The four project partners are working on a cross-type and cross-element mixture of diverse types of laboratories for cross-disciplinary use in a cross-universities settings. Thereby, the project leans on existing digital laboratories in various disciplines to create an open teaching and learning environment which can be adapted to the needs of students and to provide students with the skills necessary for future working scenarios.},

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={101727-101749},
  abstract={The Smart Factory has been a concept studied during the last decade that has not been standardized yet; for this reason, the academy and industry have developed a wide variety of new architectures that describe the integration of elements for digitization and interconnection. The present research aims to introduce a new architecture proposal for migrating traditional (automation) to smart (digitization) factories, implemented through open-source software. The proposed architecture is integrated, for the first time, by the interconnection of six main elements: cyber-physical systems, edge computing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data analytics, and cybersecurity; the research describes in detail their definitions, sub-elements, the interconnection between elements, and the minimum requirements for implementation. The test of the proposed smart factory was done through a scale smart factory pilot testing for a pick and place process, where the assembly of wood pieces from the geometric Tangram’s puzzle was required; for this reason, the pilot testing includes a six-degree-of-freedom robot arm, a conveyor, a vision system, and a storage area. The case study conducted in this research allowed the assembly of four puzzles (fish, house, rocket, and swan) that were assembled with four different batches of pieces. The implementation allowed testing flexibility and adaptability. The final assembly reports included the status of assembly, the number of pieces assembled, the number of pieces stored, the assembly sequence, and the assembly time. Similarly, the development of the SCADA system allowed asset control as well as asset monitoring. The KPIs of the assembly process measured productivity (OTD) and time tracking (ATCT and TA) of the 16 tests, founding that the interconnection and digitization of the scale manufacturing cell were fully integrated and allowed repeatability; the proposed SF architecture represents an alternative for the small and medium automated factories to achieve interconnection and digitization, and it is ready to be tested in a more complex scenario.},
