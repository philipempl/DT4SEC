  abstract={Embedded systems are today often self-sufficient systems with limited communication. However, this traditional view of an embedded system is changing rapidly. Embedded systems are nowadays evolving, e.g., an evolution pushed by the increased functional gain introduced with the concept of System of Systems (SoS) that is connecting multiple subsystems to achieve a combined functionality and/or information of a higher value. In such a SoS the subsystems will have to serve a dual purpose in a) the initial purpose that the subsystem was originally designed and deployed for, e.g., control and protection of the physical assets of a critical infrastructure system that could be up and running for 30-40 years, and b) at the same time provide information to a higher-level system for a potential future increase of system functionality as technology matures and/or new opportunities are provided by, e.g., greater analytics capabilities. In this paper, within the context of a “dual purpose use” of a) and b), we bring up three central challenges related to i) information gathering, ii) life-cycle management, and iii) data governance, and we propose directions for solutions to these challenges that need to be evaluated already at design time.},

  abstract={This study looks into the various ways that Industry 4.0 elevates the capabilities of ERP systems. Over recent years, it is evident that the Industry 4.0 concept has been the birthplace of many innovative technologies across various industries, and the practical implementation of Industry 4.0related technologies is also rapidly expanding across many industries. Moreover, the incorporation of Industry 4.0-related technologies has dramatically increased the performance of organizations and hence led to sustained profits in the long term. By integrating Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT and RFID into ERP systems, the ERP systems will be able to capture realtime data from the work floor level, enabling ERP systems to provide more accurate analytics and predictions. Therefore, upgrading the existing traditional ERP systems to support these novel technologies presented by Industry 4.0 will undoubtfully contribute to enhancing the capabilities of ERP systems. Among the limited studies investigating ERP systems from the Industry 4.0 perspective, none have focused on conducting a systematic literature review on ERP from the Industry 4.0 standpoint to investigate how Industry 4.0 enhances the capabilities of ERP systems. Therefore, this study contributes to the theory by fulfilling that knowledge gap.},

  abstract={The Factory Integration (FI) chapter of the IRDS is dedicated to ensuring that the microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure contains the necessary components to produce items at affordable cost and high volume. Realizing the potential of Moore's Law requires taking full advantage of device feature size reductions, new materials, yield improvement to near 100%, wafer size increases, and other manufacturing productivity improvements. This in turn requires a factory system that can fully integrate additional factory components and utilize these components collectively to deliver items that meet specifications determined by other IRDS international focus teams (IFTs) as well as cost, volume and yield targets. Preserving the decades-long trend of 30% per year reduction in cost per function also requires capturing all possible cost reduction opportunities. These include opportunities in front-end as well as back-end production, facilities, yield management and improvement, increased system integration such as up and down the supply chain, and improving environmental health and safety. FI challenges play a key role realizing these opportunities and many FI technology challenges are becoming limiters to achieving major technology milestones.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Smart homes (SHs) are rapidly evolving to incorporate intelligent features, including environment management, home automation, and human-machine interactions. However, safety and security risks of SHs hinder their wide adoption. Many work attempts to provide defense mechanisms to ensure safety and security against inter-rule vulnerabilities and spoofing attacks. This paper proposes IoTFuzz, a fuzzing framework that dynamically address cyber security and physical safety aspects of SHs through targeted policies. IoTFuzz mutates the inputs from policies, human activities, indoor environment, and reallife outdoor weather conditions. In addition to the binary status of devices, the continuous-value status in SHs is leveraged to perform mutation and simulation. The policies are expressed as temporal logic formulas with time constraints. For largescale testing, IoTFuzz employs digital twins to simulate normal behaviors, outdoor environment impacts, and human activities in SHs. Moreover, IoTFuzz can also intelligently infer rulepolicy correlation based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Evaluation of IoTFuzz in a configured SH with 15 rules and 10 pre-defined unique policies demonstrates its effectiveness in revealing the impacts of real-life outdoor environment. The experimental results demonstrate a range of violations, with a maximum of 4154 violations and a minimum of 41 violations observed over an 8-year period under varying weather conditions. IoTFuzz also identifies the potential risks associated with improper human activities, accounting for up to 35.4% of risky situations in SHs.},

  pages={34113-34126},
  abstract={The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github.},

  abstract={Industrial processes rely on sensory data for critical decision-making processes. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the trustworthiness of data. To this end, we envision a blockchain-based framework for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to address the issues of data management and security. Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, we leverage digital twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent conclusions from the data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs.},

  abstract={Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaborate by leveraging local computational power and the model’s transmission. This method reduces the costs and privacy concerns associated with centralized machine learning methods while ensuring data privacy by distributing training data across heterogeneous devices. On the other hand, federated learning has the drawback of data leakage due to the lack of privacy-preserving mechanisms employed during storage, transfer, and sharing, thus posing significant risks to data owners and suppliers. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising technology for offering secure data-sharing platforms in federated learning, especially in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) settings. This survey aims to compare the performance and security of various data privacy mechanisms adopted in blockchain-based federated learning architectures. We conduct a systematic review of existing literature on secure data-sharing platforms for federated learning provided by blockchain technology, providing an in-depth overview of blockchain-based federated learning, its essential components, and discussing its principles, and potential applications. The primary contribution of this survey paper is to identify critical research questions and propose potential directions for future research in blockchain-based federated learning.},

  title={Using Composable NFTs for Trading and Managing Expensive Packaged Products in the Food Industry}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={10587-10603},
  abstract={The authenticity, traceability, and management of expensive food products require trusted, secure, and transparent end-to-end data provenance and transactions. In today’s systems, transactions and data related to managing and tracing the origins and history of food products are typically stored in segregated data repositories, and controlled and managed by centralized entities, with no access or visibility to the public or key stakeholders. This increases the risk of data loss, alteration, and tampering. Further it erodes trust among all stakeholders, and weakens consumer sentiment and confidence in the expensive food market, and raises concerns about the verifiability and authenticity of expensive food products. To overcome this problem, this paper addresses the lack of traceability and authenticity problems in expensive food products utilizing blockchain technology and NFTs. NFTs are blockchain-based tokens that can be utilized to represent ownership of unique assets. We propose an NFT-based solution for expensive food products trading management, where the ownership of a food product is maintained by using digital certification, and the trading process is facilitated by smart contracts. We utilize composable NFTs for food products, where interrelated products, such as raw materials, packaged products, and Lots, are represented as top-down and bottom-up composable NFTs in the form of parent-child relationship. Composable NFTs embed extra utility within NFTs, especially when subsets of NFTs are needed. We integrate the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) decentralized storage into our solution to avoid storing large files on the blockchain while maintaining their permanency and immutability. We present various diagrams to show the system elements and the interactions among them. We illustrate algorithms along with the solution implementation details. We evaluate our solution by conducting cost and security analyses. We make our smart contracts code publicly available on GitHub.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={641-648},
  abstract={The ever-increasing concerns on data security and user privacy have significantly impacted the current centralized mechanism of intelligent systems in bridging private data islands and idle computing resources commonly dispersed at the edge. To resolve that, a novel distributed learning paradigm, called Federated Learning (FL), which can learn a global model in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner, has been proposed and widely discussed. Furthermore, to tackle the data heterogeneity and model adaptation issues faced by FL, meta-learning starts to be applied together with FL to rapidly train a global model with high generalization. However, since federated meta-learning is still in its infancy to collaborate with participants in synchronous mode, straggler and over-fitting issues may impede its application in ubiquitous intelligence, such as smart health and intelligent transportation. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous federated meta-learning mechanism, called AFMeta, that can measure the staleness of local models to enhance model aggregation. To the best of our knowledge, AFMeta is the first work studying the asynchronous mode in federated meta-learning. We evaluate AFMeta against state-of-the-art baselines on classification and regression tasks. The results show that it boosts the model performance by 44.23% and reduces the learning time by 86.35%.},

  abstract={Video surveillance in trauma room can improve the security, patient safety, healthcare standards, and hygiene monitoring, but video surveillance system can cause privacy breach by showing and storing sensitive information of patients and staff. Head blurring can protect privacy, and we can still able to know most actions of people with blurred head. But when postures of people in the videos are complex or when there are many people, using real-time detection program to detect and blur heads is challenging, with a high missed detection rate. OpenPose is a state-of-the-art human body skeletons estimation framework. And we build a head detection and blurring technique based on OpenPose to solve this problem. We first use OpenPose to extract 18 human key skeleton points, and find 5 key skeleton points which are used to describe head. Finally, we apply the image obfuscation techniques to the detected heads. The experiment results show that our proposed techniques can ensure privacy protection and reduces the missed detection rate of the output results. Our experiment results prove that our proposed technique has a high value in privacy protection applications.},

  abstract={In the not so distant future, the rise of the metaverse will bring multiple opportunities to people and societies all over the world. Through pioneering technologies integrated, it aims to revolutionise and significantly improve our lives. Unfortunately the metaverse can also be exploited and abused to facilitate the operations of extremists and terrorists as it has already happened in social media and online blogs and forums. Using the metaverse’s virtual reality, A.I., digital twins and avatars to their advantage, the various extremist/terrorist organisations and groups can successfully spread their radical ideologies and propaganda, recruit new members and plan their attacks more effectively and with minimum costs. In the metaverse, such operations will have greater impact since the users will be an actual part of the metaverse and therefore fully immersed in it. In this paper, we aim to provide a better understanding of how extremists and terrorists can exploit the metaverse and its services through the usage of appropriate discussion and relevant examples. Concluding, we give some general direction on what needs to be done to prevent such unfortunate scenarios.},

As the complexity of software ecosystems is inherently higher than regular systems, existing safety mechanisms are no longer reliable in their context. This paper introduces a research path towards adaptive safety mechanisms that can support the degree of dynamism and high level of uncertainty introduced by these systems of systems. Our planned approach is to use runtime trust evaluation as a decision factor when enabling or disabling safety features on demand.},

  abstract={Internet of things-based devices is widely used in various applications to ease the usage of technology. The applications of such devices lie in multiple sectors like healthcare, supply chain, warehouses, research and development, smart infrastructure, etc. These devices are equipped with Internet connectivity, sensors, a small battery, and limited bandwidth. The idea behind such devices is to accomplish the goal with the minimum resources. Cyber attackers take advantage of the concept of Internet of Things-based devices by targeting such devices to steal user information from the network. These devices can be attacked through various types of attacks like ransomware, denial of service, malware, data, and identity theft. Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence is widely employed by researchers to detect such attacks, and using optimized modeling for the same task can lead to a secure environment for these devices. In this paper, Convolutional Neural Networks based approach is given to detect internet of Things intrusion attacks. Our proposed approach achieves 0.993 area of Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve which proves the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

  abstract={The 6th generation of wireless mobile networks is emerging as a paradigm shifting successor to unifying the experience across the physical, digital, and human worlds, pushing boundaries on performance in capacity, throughput, latency, scalability, flexibility, and reliability, while prominently addressing new major factors, including sustainability, security and privacy, as well as digital inclusion. Many research institutions and initiatives worldwide have started investigations to make 6G a reality by approximately 2030. In Germany, federal funding from the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) supports a large-scale 6G initiative, with its lighthouse project, called 6G-ANNA. The core aim of this project is to develop the key aspects of a holistic, sustainable, secure, and resilient 6G system design that will simplify and improve the interaction between humans, digital assets, and the physical environment. This paper shares the vision of the project’s main technical working areas and advances, spanning topics from radio access, integration of multiple networks, as well as automation and simplification in networking to new applications and testbed scenarios, including real-time digital twins and extended reality. The industrial impact and relevance of standardization makes 6G-ANNA uniquely positioned to lead and realize the vision of next-generation wireless mobile network technologies, systems, and applications.},

  volume={},

  pages={1868-1875},
  abstract={The emergence of shilling attacks has threatened the security of recommender systems, which can seriously affect the trustworthiness of recommendation results and reduce the stickiness of users. The state-of-the-art detection methods have showed the effectiveness by manually or automatically extracting detection features. However, these methods lack universality because they tend to focus on detecting individual attacks or group shilling attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a unified framework for detecting various shilling attacks based on BiLSTM and three-way decision, which is named Bi-TWD for short. Firstly, each user rating behavior trajectory is divided into multiple subsequences and a window feature vector can be generated from each subsequence. Secondly, all window feature vectors of the same user are integrated into a fused behavior representation by using BiLSTM and the suspicious degree of each user is calculated. Finally, according to user suspicious degree, users are classified into a positive domain, a negative domain and a boundary domain by using the three-way decision theory. Users in the positive domain are regarded as attack users; the ones in the negative domain are referred to genuine users, while users in the boundary domain are further analyzed. The experiments are conducted on the Netflix and the sampled Amazon datasets, and the experimental results show the effectiveness and excellent performance of the proposed method for detecting various attacks.},

  year={2022},

  pages={596-603},
  abstract={Deep flow inspection (DFI) has been increasingly important for network management and security protection. Network flows have rich correlations due to multiparty communications such as video conferences and DDoS attacks, and furthermore, rich features are vital for artificial intelligence-driven DFI models and algorithms. However, existing approaches do not correlate network flows by just providing simple counters for key-valued network flow records due to the limitations of the measurement models.We present Mercury, a broad and deep flow inspection system, which continuously collects a wide range of features for large scales of correlated network flows and supports expressive query interfaces for diverse network measurement tasks. Mercury organizes rich and dynamic features of the network traffic based on a streaming graph model, which defines rich states for each network flow to the edge of the graph and incrementally updates these states in high-performance pipelines. Mercury raises significant challenges for storing and updating states in the streaming graph model due to the fast arrival rate and the in-memory storage limits. We present a nested two-dimensional data store, called cuckoo matrix, to provide a two-dimensional index for the streaming graph model. The cuckoo matrix optimizes the state-update throughput and reduces the memory cost through the multiple dimensions of the cuckoo tables. We speed up the ingestion process based on a threaded lock-free butter and update the feature statistics based on a unified streaming framework.Extensive evaluation with real-world data sets demonstrates that Mercury achieves a significantly better trade-off between throughput and memory consumption than state-of-the-art methods. Mercury supports both traditional machine learning methods and accurate graph neural networks for traffic classification through extensive and efficient graph query APIs.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={301-309},
  abstract={Electronic registration identification technology (ERI) has developed rapidly in recent years. This technology has been widely used in large urban transportation monitoring, vehicle counting, identification, and traffic congestion detection. It has many advantages, such as long recognition distance, high recognition accuracy, more information stored, fast reading speed, etc. Currently this technology has achieved full coverage of the entire road network and vehicles in the cities where it is applied. Despite the richness of this data, there are significant limitations in terms of vehicle trajectories, especially in terms of spatial and temporal density. Compared with ERI trajectories, vehicle GPS trajectories have a higher sampling rate, but we are unable to obtain more comprehensive and complete vehicle GPS data due to the limitations of vehicle technology and security factors. In this paper, we innovatively propose a new method to reconstruct fine-grained ERI trajectories by learning from taxi GPS data. This approach can be divided into two steps. First, a novel Taxi-ERI traffic network is proposed to connect ERI data and taxi data. It’s a directed multi-graph whose nodes are consisted of all ERI acquisition points and edges are composed of clustered taxi trajectories. Then, the probability of each road is calculated by a Bayes classification based on the multi-road travel time distribution model while there are multi roads between two adjacent acquisition points, the model parameters are trained by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Finally, we extensively evaluate the proposed framework on the taxi trajectory dataset and ERI data collected from Chongqing, China. The experimental results show that the method can accurately reconstruct vehicle trajectories.},

  volume={10},

  abstract={A novel conceptual framework is developed that depicts a generic Freeport model underpinned by 5G technology. The framework is based on preliminary findings from a 5G testbed project and secondary 5G use cases from both practice and academic literature. We first provide a descriptive model of the current state of a port without 5G and Freeport status, identify the challenges and opportunities for logistics flows if Freeport status is attained and then prescribe how 5G may enable seamless logistics flows. With multiple challenges for ports generally, Freeport status increases the level of complexity of the core and support business processes that deliver goods from origin to destination. Despite that increased complexity, Freeports can attract investment and generate revenue, thus the enablement of Freeports is notionally beneficial in the long run. As complexity is anathema to smooth logistics flows, we develop a prescriptive model to exploit 5G to improve efficiency and effectiveness within a Freeport. We demonstrate the application of the prescriptive model with a 5G Freeport use case supported by simulation results, from which we aim to contribute to the overall adoption of 5G in Freeports.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the growth of advanced technologies is paving the way for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and making them more efficient and smarter. However, this makes ICS more connected to communication networks that provide a potential platform for attackers to intrude into the systems and cause damage and catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose implementing digital twins that have been equipped with an intrusion detection algorithm. Our novel algorithm is able to detect attacks in a timely manner and also diagnose the type of attack by classification of different types of attacks. With digital twins, which are a new concept in ICS, we have virtual replicas of physical systems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of the physical systems. So by placing the intrusion detection algorithm in digital twins, security tests can be done remotely without risking negative impacts on live systems.},

Extensive use of digital twins – so called massive twinning – is also being proposed, in the EU project Hexa-X, as an important use case family of 6G applications. In this study, we examine security aspects of digital twins, focusing on network-related digital twins by means of a threat analysis. We identify and systematize threats affecting these network digital twin systems by using the STRIDE methodology, discuss the different DT threat surfaces and examine the role of DT specific threat surfaces. We also discuss how networks can be impacted by such threats as well as provide examples of threat impact on salient networking focused DT use case families such as network operations and management, network optimization & modeling, etc. Further, we identify aspects of twin architecture which give rise to DT-specific threats. These include not only the overall increased threat surface due to the detailed system data being exported to the DT, but also the introduction of new communication channels and the synchronization process which play a role. Finally, we briefly outline promising directions to explore for mitigating the identified threats in future network digital twin environments.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical Systems can be defined as a complex networked control system, which normally develop by combining several physical components with the cyber space. Cyber Physical System are already a part of our daily life. As its already being a part of everyone life, CPS also have great potential security threats and can be vulnerable to various cyber-attacks without showing any sign directly to component failure. To protect user security and privacy is a fundamental concern of any kind of system; either it’s a simple web application or supplicated professional system. Digital Multifactor authentication is one of the best ways to make secure authentication. It covers many different areas of a Cyber-connected world, including online payments, communications, access right management, etc. Most of the time, Multifactor authentication is little complex as it requires extra step from users. This paper will discuss the evolution from single authentication to Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) starting from Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) and through Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This paper seeks to analyze and evaluate the most prominent authentication techniques based on accuracy, cost, and feasibility of implementation. We also suggest several authentication schemes which incorporate with Multifactor authentication for CPS.},

  abstract={Today's power systems are seeing a paradigm shift under the energy transition, sparkled by the electrification of demand, digitalisation of systems, and an increasing share of decarbonated power generation. Most of these changes have a direct impact on their control centers, forcing them to handle weather-based energy resources, new interconnections with neighbouring transmission networks, more markets, active distribution networks, micro-grids, and greater amounts of available data. Unfortunately, these changes have translated during the past decade to small, incremental changes, mostly centered on hardware, software, and human factors. We assert that more transformative changes are needed, especially regarding humancentered design approaches, to enable control room operators to manage the future power system. This paper discusses the evolution of operators towards continuous operation planners, monitoring complex time horizons thanks to adequate real-time automation. Reviewing upcoming challenges as well as emerging technologies for power systems, we present our vision of a new evolutionary architecture for control centers, both at backend and frontend levels. We propose a unified hypervision scheme based on structured decision-making concepts, providing operators with proactive, collaborative, and effective decision support.},

To solve the problem of identity privacy leakage during blockchain transactions, this paper proposes an identity privacy protection scheme based on the Hyperledger Fabric(IPP-HF). By making appropriate improvements to the certificateless signature and using the cooperation of long-term and short-term pseudo-identities, this paper designs an identity privacy protection scheme based on certificateless signature on the consortium blockchain Fabric, which makes the scheme satisfy the node identity anonymity and protects the privacy of user identity. Through theoretical analysis, it is proved that IPP-HF scheme can resist common public key replacement attacks and tampering attacks, and has the characteristics of signature unforgeability and guaranteed node anonymity. Finally, by comparing with other schemes, IPPHF scheme ensures high signature and verification efficiency while having strong anonymity.},

At the same time, donors are unable to track the use of single donation funds. In this paper, we propose a scheme to assist in regulation through blockchain, using blockchain technology to track the use of charitable funds, speed up the auditing process of funds, and enhance the transparency of the use of charitable funds. At the same time, we consider the privacy protection issues involved in the process of charitable funds regulation, we use confidential computing technology to implement a data privacy protection strategy that allows data owners to flexibly manage the access authorization of data.

  year={2022},

  pages={1774-1781},
  abstract={Software vulnerability detection has attracted more and more attention. Traditional vulnerability detection methods require a lot of expertise to define the vulnerability features, whereas the deep learning based methods can perform the feature extraction automatically. These deep learning based techniques handle the problem directly by regarding the code fragments as a series of tokens or a single graph structure, which makes them perform well on synthetic or semi-synthetic datasets. However, for real-world scenarios, the existing deep learning based techniques still suffer from some limitations. In this work, we propose PATVD, a vulnerability detection method combining pre-training techniques and adversarial training. We first use the pre-training model to combine the source code fragments and the corresponding data flow graph, such that both the characteristics of code structures and the token sequence can be integrated to learn the more complex vulnerability information contained in the real-world datasets. Then, to address the imbalance in the distribution of real-world datasets, we incorporate adversarial training on the code embedding space as a way of regularization to improve model generalization. Finally, the code representation added to the adversarial training is given to the classification model. To verify the validity of our method, we perform a set of comparative experimental evaluations on both artificially synthesized datasets and the latest published real-world datasets. The experimental results show that PATVD has achieved better results than the state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The adversarial training module can also make the model attain additional gains on real-world datasets.},

Motivated attackers can utilize the consistency of sensitive attribute values to perform re-identification attacks, namely, existence attacks.

  abstract={Mental health chatbots can provide psychological counseling services to patients at any time regardless of time and location, which can not only relieve patients’ ailments but also reduce the workload of psychologists. In order to provide patients with accurate diagnosis and treatment services, mental health robots inevitably collect patient-related information during the communication process with patients, which is often very sensitive and must be well protected. There is a lack of targeted research on how mental health chatbots can provide systematic privacy preserving for patients in the process of providing mental health services to them. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving framework based on blockchain and confidential computing that can provide comprehensive privacy preserving for patients during mental health chatbot services. We conduct tests using existing mental health chatbots, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can meet the requirements for privacy preserving and computational performance of mental health chatbots.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technology, by performing simulation, analysis, and prediction over the data mapped to digital space, can create a digital replica of the physical object. It can be combined with edge computing or cloud computing to provide broad vehicle-to-everything applications and improve the service quality of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). In this paper, DT technology and mobile edge computing are integrated into VANETs to introduce a framework of mobile digital twin edge network-driven VANETs (MDTEN-Driven VANETs). Moreover, facing the security and privacy challenges in the framework, we propose a synchronized privacy-preserving authentication (SPPA) scheme. In SPPA, we first design a synchronized anonymous certificateless aggregate signature (SA-CLAS) to achieve the authentication with time state synchronization and the privacy preservation of the real identity. Furthermore, to deal with malicious vehicles, we adopt blockchain technology and devise a smart contract algorithm to manage the public information of vehicles. The security analysis demonstrates that SA-CLAS is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks, and SPPA can satisfy the necessary security requirements. The performance evaluation shows the efficiency and practicality of SA-CLAS and SPPA. Besides, the designed smart contract is implemented in an Ethereum test network, which presents an acceptable blockchain consumption.},

  abstract={The security in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks becomes increasingly important with the growing popularity of IoT devices and their wide applications (e.g., critical infrastructure monitoring). However, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not suitable for IoT networks due to their large resource requirements. Moreover, IoT networks tend to have multiple access points for IoT devices and thus benefit from a distributed framework to enable collaborative prevention of potential attacks. To this end, we propose a lightweight collaborative distributed network IDS (NIDS) based on widely-utilized machine learning (ML) models, which are trained through a federated learning framework with two known datasets. We evaluate the distributed NIDS using the trained ML models on an IoT network testbed under seven types of attacks in comparison with Snort (a state-of-the-art IDS) and a centralized implementation of our proposed NIDS. An offline benchmark is also designed to measure the system’s performance with regard to resource usage and response time. Our results show that the proposed distributed NIDS outperforms Snort in identifying malicious traffic and achieves a much lower false positive rate compared to the centralized version in real-time for all seven types of network attacks tested.},

  abstract={Healthcare supply chains have evolved drastically over time, with complex domestic and global networks and interactions spanning across various organizations and entities. This gives rise to numerous challenges related to information and data pertaining to medical devices used within healthcare supply chain, including data integrity, provenance, traceability, and transparency. Counterfeit medical devices are a major obstacle that the healthcare industry is trying to resolve as it poses a huge risk to the safety of its users. Therefore, it is paramount to have an end-to-end system in place that tracks medical devices not only as they move across the supply chain but also as they are purchased and sold online in digital marketplaces. Unfortunately, existing systems follow a centralized architecture, which leads to being a single point of failure and eradicating transparency and authentication. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT) based solution that exploits blockchain smart contracts, integrates tokenization protocols, and utilizes a decentralized storage system for a reliable and efficient medical devices traceability system and ownership management solution. In our proposed system, NFTs are used to represent the digital twin of the medical device. This digital twin captures the medical device attributes and its relevant metadata during its life cycle from production, manufacturing, distribution and movement, to current use and ownership. We present the system architecture and implementation details, along with tested algorithms that define the various functions of our smart contracts. The paper also presents testing details and analyses the solution’s feasibility through a cost and security analysis.},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={The gradual fusion of intelligent transportation systems with metaverse technologies is giving rise to vehicular metaverses, which blend virtual spaces with physical space. As indispensable components for vehicular metaverses, Vehicular Twins (VTs) are digital replicas of Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs) and facilitate customized metaverse services to VMUs. VTs are established and maintained in RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient computing and storage resources. Due to the limited communication coverage of RSUs and the high mobility of VMUs, VTs need to be migrated among RSUs to ensure real-time and seamless services for VMUs. However, during VT migrations, physical-virtual synchronization and massive communications among VTs may cause identity and location privacy disclosures of VMUs and VTs. In this article, we study privacy issues and the corresponding defenses for VT migrations in vehicular metaverses. We first present four kinds of specific privacy attacks during VT migrations. Then, we propose a VMU-VT dual pseudonym scheme and a synchronous pseudonym change framework to defend against these attacks. Additionally, we evaluate average privacy entropy for pseudonym changes and optimize the number of pseudonym distribution based on inventory theory. Numerical results show that the average utility of VMUs under our proposed schemes is 33.8% higher than that under the equal distribution scheme, demonstrating the superiority of our schemes.},

  abstract={The current transformation of the energy system brings new challenges in the areas of supply security, reliability, and efficiency. Especially the decentralization leads to an increasing complexity and a bidirectional power flow. This requires an expansion and initiative-taking operation of the distribution grid. To investigate the behavior of a complex and dynamic distribution grid or individual plants within it, novel methods such as digital twins can be used. In this approach, a model is developed based on the real distribution grid, which can represent and predict the behavior of the real system. For this, the measurement of data in the physical distribution grid and the transmission of this data to the digital model is essential. This paper focuses on the development of a grid analyzer for digital twins of distribution grids. With the grid analyzer, the characteristics of the power grid like frequency or amplitude of voltage and current can be analyzed, evaluated, and finally sent to the digital twin. Functions such as a Fast Fourier Transformation, a Frequency- and Phase-Locked-Loop, and other algorithms are being developed to analyze the grid state. The development of the functions is model-based and follows different development stages from classic simulation over hybrid simulation to a laboratory test in the last chapter of the paper.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT)-based monitoring, using smart sensors to gather contextual data, is becoming the norm for making informed decisions. cyber-physical systems (CPS) play a crucial role in the digitization of monitoring systems and fostering collaboration. Nevertheless, traditional monitoring techniques are insufficient in capturing all environmental and health-related factors. Smart monitoring is enhanced by digital twin (DT) technology, which creates a precise digital replica of a physical object and its interactions with the environment. The DT is constantly updated and allows for real-time simulations and accurate control. This study proposes a novel cyber-physical approach using DT to monitor the health and environment of individuals in low-density rural areas. DT is integrated with IoT-cloud-based monitoring solutions to collect environmental data, physiological signals, and their relationship. The dew layer determines the irregularity of health and meteorological events in real-time and alerts caretakers. Cloud space determines health severity using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, with emergency notifications sent accordingly. KeySharing mechanism ensures data security during information transmission. A case study on the establishment of DT is conducted to validate the proposed approach, with findings emphasizing the importance of understanding the environmental and healthcare sectors for future research.},

  abstract={Multi-hop knowledge base question answering aims to answer natural language questions through multi-hop relation reasoning in the knowledge base. An important challenge of the task is the lack of labels for reasoning paths, which leads to the possibility to produce correct answers through incorrect paths in the training, and cannot generalize well in testing. Recently research has attempted to handle the challenge by devising reward shaping or introducing additional information to generate supervision signals of intermediate paths. But they required extra expert experience and label information. To address this situation, we propose a novel method under the teacher-student framework, it leverages perturbation consistency to learn intermediate paths. In the teacher network, we construct close data points for intermediate path prediction by applying random perturbations. Inspired by the data smoothing assumption that labels of close data points should be the same, a consistency loss over predictions of constructed data points and original ones is evaluated. The student network is used to answer questions more precisely by leveraging the intermediate distribution learned from the teacher network. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets are conducted, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  title={Constructing Efficient Set of APs Via Spatial Discrimination and Localization Difference}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={49-56},
  abstract={RSSI fingerprint-based localization has been one of the most attractive solutions, since it is free of extra infrastructure and specialized hardware. As wireless networks become more widely used, however, the number of APs for localization has been increasing and then results in "invalid APs", nearly APs that are redundant or have a negative impact on locating, and raises the computational overhead in the process of localization. To solve these problems, the previous literatures focused on selecting some efficient APs for localization. These approaches could remove a few of redundant APs and reduce the localization overhead to a certain extent, but the performance of locating will fluctuate significantly. In this paper, we propose a constructing efficient set of APs via spatial discrimination and localization difference, ESAP. First, for a single AP, we use the information gain rate to evaluate its spatial resolution ability, which effectively reflects the difference between the maps constructed by the fingerprints of each AP at different sampling points, and shows the AP’s discrimination of spatial locations. Moreover, we calculate the localization capability of APs at different sampling points, and design an incremental clustering algorithm based on the information gain rate of APs by using the localization differences of each AP at each sampling point. The algorithm generates various candidate sets according to the geographical diversity of AP’s fingerprint map, and is more robust in actual applications. Finally, an effective set of APs algorithm based on the minimum-maximum principle is proposed. In the process of constructing the effective set, suitable APs are chosen on the basis of the clustering results and the predefined requirements. Extensive experiments in real large-scale environment validates that the performance of our ESAP outperforms the existing AP selection methods, Info-Gain, ESC and SDN. When reducing APs by 40%, the accuracy of ESAP is better than these three methods by 15.5%, 22.2% and 10.11% respectively. Under different sampling densities, it can also maintain a good localization improvement effect. Meanwhile, our ESAP has better stability with 95% localization error within 1.3m.},

  abstract={Perception algorithms are commonly used in ubiquitous computing. Deep neural networks have achieved significant performance in computer vision field, yet were found that exist vulnerabilities which was misclassified by adversarial examples. This issue has attracted great attention to explore methods to defend against adversarial examples. Detecting adversarial examples is a basic work for improving robustness of models. However, how to exploit an efficient feature to distinguish clean examples and adversarial ones is a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate the adversarial examples from frequency domain and propose a framework to detect and classify adversarial attacks combing with attention mechanism. We first demonstrate that adversarial perturbations are more perceptible in the frequency domain and exploit this to achieve significant detection results. Then, combined with the advantages of the attention mechanism, an integrate network is proposed to achieve a more refined classification of attack methods. Based on the structure of ResNetl8, our results achieve optimal detection rate and high classification rate of 73% among FGSM, PGD-$\ell_{2}$, PGD$-\ell_{\infty}$, Deepfool and MI-FGSM.},

  abstract={Phase Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM) is a promising non-volatile memory device due to its attractive properties such as low power, fast access time, high storage density and bit addressability. In Internet of Things (IoT) edge computing environment, IoT terminal can greatly improve its storage and computation performance by adopt PCRAM. However, PCRAM suffers from its weakness in endurance. Existing PCRAM wear-leveling researches and proposed algorithms are mainly for storage class main memory architecture and applications. Due to the lack of Memory Management Unit (MMU) in most popular low power IoT terminal Micro Controller Unit (MCU), most existing PCRAM wear-leveling algorithms are not suitable and cannot be used directly in IoT Terminal PCRAM management. Based on our previous research on the storage and computation integrated architecture of IoT terminal, this paper proposes a Block and Bit Double Layer (BBDL) IoT terminal PCRAM wear-leveling algorithm for the first time. A dynamic and static hybrid strategy of block layer and bit layer algorithm is investigated. FPGA based prototype experiments and high level synthesis (HLS) and Simulink based algorithm simulations are carried out. Simulation results show that the proposed BBDL algorithm can effectively improve the endurance of PCRAM in IoT terminal applications.},

Specifically, PRAD employs two parallel graph attention networks (GATs) to learn metric-oriented and time-oriented relationships. A temporal convolutional attention network (TCAN) is used to capture complex long-term dependencies. Furthermore, to tackle the overfitting issue in the variational auto-encoder (VAE), PRAD designs a reconstruction-based module that combines VAE with a generative adversarial network (GAN). The experimental results on the two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PRAD outperforms existing anomaly detection methods.},

  abstract={Location-based services greatly facilitate people’s daily life, which puts forward higher requirements for the location calculation of target objects in different environments. Since the fingerprint positioning method does not require additional special equipment and easy to implement, it has become one of the most attractive solutions. In order to ensure the positioning accuracy, this method requires complete sampling of the fingerprints of the positioning area, so a lot of sampling costs are required. In particular, when sampling buildings with multiple floors, the labor and time of the entire sampling process will increase dramatically. At the same time, certain floors or rooms may not be allowed to open, so their fingerprints cannot be sampled. In fact, the floor structures of buildings are mostly similar or the same, such as office buildings, hotels. Therefore, this paper proposes a fuzzy transfer learning model and builds the corresponding prototype system FTLoc. On the premise of ensuring the positioning accuracy of different floors, the system greatly reduces the sampling cost of the entire building. First, for the complete fingerprint data (source domain) of a certain floor, we mine the fingerprint features fine-grained to generate a short-term feature set for each sampling point. Then, according to the sparsity and timing of short-term features, we design an optimized SELSTM, and obtain an effective localization model as the PreModel for transfer learning. Finally, fuzzy clustering is used to add category labels to the source domain data and target domain data, and input them into PreModel to realize the localization model transfer, so as to avoid their data distribution differences affecting the transfer effect as much as possible. FTLoc is fully validated in a multi-storey building. According to the experimental results, when using the first floor sampling data as the source domain, the errors of the FTLoc system on the adjacent floor (second floor) are 1.38 meters (sampling rate = 80%) and 2.33 meters (sampling rate = 30%). The average errors in non-adjacent layers (three, four, five) are 1.92 meters (sampling rate = 80%), 2.87 meters (sampling rate = 30%). Compared with traditional migration, the FTLoc system increased by 18.1% and 12.6% respectively. At the same time, the experiment verified that the error jitter multiple of the FTLoc system under different devices and different sampling densities does not exceed 1.5. Therefore, the FTLoc system designed in this paper ensures the transfer learning effect of different floors, and has good robustness and reliability. In actual positioning applications, the system greatly reduces the sampling cost and achieves high-precision positioning at the same time.},

  abstract={After the Internet of Things technology is applied to the intelligent transportation system (ITS), the ITS is becoming more perfect. Optical wireless communications (OWC) in intelligent transportation is optimized by in-depth analysis in the present work. Working principles of visible light communications (VLC) in intelligent transportation are discussed systematically. Afterward, a scheme based on carrier-less amplitude/phase modulation is proposed. VLC is optimized by introducing an adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE). While the optical signal spectra are analyzed, a convolutional neural network is employed to extract features from the original images, avoiding data reconstruction. Simulation experiments reveal that by combining the digital domain linear equalizer with the modified DFE, the error vector magnitude can be increased by about 4 dB compared to that yielded by single linear equalizers. Taking a support vector machine as the binary classifier, a hyperplane is generated to classify the two sets of data. Consequently, the recognition accuracy for spectrum parameters reaches almost 100 percent, which is significantly better than other deep learning (DL) algorithms. To sum up, DL-based spectrum analysis can apply to OWC systems for intelligent transportation. The research is of great significance to improve the performance of optical wireless communication in intelligent transportation and meet higher traffic demand.},

  abstract={The recent advances in AI have enabled novel approaches and remarkable enhancements in the provision of existing services and applications. The metaverse is one of the emerging applications that got the advantages of this technological progression. Due to the cooperation between several cutting-edge technologies including IoT, digital twin (DT), and big data, the metaverse highly relies on the manipulation of an immense amount of gathered data. In this context, security is a major challenge, and as such, blockchain brings several advantages to the metaverse ecosystem as it allows secure and transparent data storage. However, with the dynamic nature of such an ecosystem and the fast variation in its AI-based services, the traditional blockchain features (e.g. smart contracts and consensus protocols) will face big challenges to meet the needed dynamic service requirements and scalability. This positioning paper proposes the concept of using a blockchain governed by AI to leverage the various features and advantages of blockchain services. The paper provides a review of the role of blockchain in the metaverse, challenges that arise, and then the role of AI in building intelligent blockchain features and their impact on the metaverse ecosystem.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing Digital Twin (DT) technology for real-time data storage and processing in emergency healthcare. Focusing on Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies, we investigate various enabling technologies, including cloud platforms, data transmission formats, and storage file formats, to develop a feasible DT storage solution for emergency healthcare. Through our analysis, we find Amazon AWS to be the most suitable cloud platform due to its sophisticated real-time data processing and analytical tools. Additionally, we determine that the MQTT protocol is suitable for real-time medical data transmission, and FHIR is the most appropriate medical file storage format for emergency healthcare situations.We propose a cloud-based DT storage solution, in which real-time medical data is transmitted to AWS IoT Core, processed by Kinesis Data Analytics, and stored securely in AWS HealthLake. Despite the feasibility of the proposed solution, challenges such as insufficient access control, lack of encryption, and vendor conformity must be addressed for successful practical implementation. Future work may involve incorporating Hyperledger Fabric technology and HTTPS protocol to enhance security, while the maturation of DT technology is expected to resolve vendor conformity issues. By addressing these challenges, our proposed DT storage solution has the potential to improve data accessibility and decision-making in emergency healthcare settings.},

  year={2023},

  pages={2450-2465},
  abstract={Smart home systems are both technologically and economically advancing rapidly. As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone's privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permission-based access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic Author: Please provide index terms/keywords for your article. To download the IEEE Taxonomy go to http://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf ?> the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by Jia et al. 2017, and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by Celik et al. 2017, and achieved a 100% accuracy. Our experimental studies indicate that adopting CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.},

  abstract={With the continuous evolution of emerging technologies such as mobile network, machine learning (ML), 5G, etc., digital twins (DT) bursts out great potential by its capacity of data analysis, data tracking, data prediction, etc, building a bridge between the physical and information world. Meanwhile, mobile network is moving towards data-driven paradigm, the issue of data privacy and data security seem to be a bottleneck. As a result, federated learning (FL) and mobile network are deeply converging. However, the mobile network is time-varying and the parameters of FL-empowered mobile network is huge and continue to increase with exponential growth of wireless terminals, result in the failure of traditional modeling. In the mobile networks, DT is conducive to prototyping, testing, and optimization, enabling mobile networks to be modelled more efficiently in a virtual environment and thus providing guidance for practical application. To this end, a communication-assisted sensing scenario is considered in this paper with FL in DT-empowered mobile networks. More specifically, two communication-assisted sensing architectures are proposed to improve communication efficiency of mobile network, namely, centralized architecture of federated transfer learning (FTL) and decentralized architecture of FTL. For centralized architecture of FTL, feature extraction of sensing information is conducted by FL between partial nodes and central server while the remaining nodes are used to train the fully connected layers at the central server. Considering data safety during the communication between sensing nodes, a decentralized architecture is designed based on FTL and Blockchain, where the feature extraction module is obtained by the fusion of sharing model (by Blockchain) and local model. The performance of proposed schemes is evaluated and demonstrated by the simulations.},

  abstract={The rapid adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and digital twins (DTs) technologies within industrial environments has highlighted diverse critical issues related to safety and security. Sensor failure is one of the major threats compromising DTs operations. In this article, for the first time, we address the problem of sensor fault detection, isolation, and accommodation (SFDIA) in large-size networked systems. Current available machine-learning solutions are either based on shallow networks unable to capture complex features from input graph data or on deep networks with overshooting complexity in the case of large number of sensors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework for sensor validation based on a deep recurrent graph convolutional architecture which jointly learns a graph structure and models spatio-temporal interdependencies. More specifically, the proposed two-block architecture 1) constructs the virtual sensors in the first block to refurbish anomalous (i.e., faulty) behavior of unreliable sensors and to accommodate the isolated faulty sensors and 2) performs the detection and isolation tasks in the second block by means of a classifier. Extensive analysis on two publicly available datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed architecture over existing state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={The digital experience emerging in the virtual world is a reality with the advent of the metaverse. Augmented reality(AR), virtual reality(VR), extended reality(XR), and artificial intelligence(AI) algorithms would pave the way for an immersive experience for the users in the virtual space. However, the explosion of these technologies broaches new challenges to threaten the success of metaverse due to security risks. The blockchain technology augmented with AI promises to deliver a trusted metaverse for everyone. Nevertheless, smart contracts fail to produce a cognitive prediction, dissuading users from confiding in the metaverse. We arm smart contracts with intelligence to predict using AI algorithms. Moreover, we deploy the smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform and produce a prediction accuracy of 95% compared to Python scikit-learn-based predictions. Our results show that the prediction delay can obstruct the growth of metaverse applications to accept blockchain technologies. Furthermore, the limitation of blockchain technology can make integration unreasonable. Therefore, we discuss possible scalability solutions that can be part of our future work to help more metaverse applications adopt blockchain solutions.},

  abstract={With the 5th Generation (5G) Mobile network being rolled out gradually in 2019, the research for the next generation mobile network has been started and targeted for 2030. To pave the way for the development of the 6th Generation (6G) mobile network, the vision and requirements should be identified first for the potential key technology identification and comprehensive system design. This article first identifies the vision of the society development towards 2030 and the new application scenarios for mobile communication, and then the key performance requirements are derived from the service and application perspective. Taken into account the convergence of information technology, communication technology and big data technology, a logical mobile network architecture is proposed to resolve the lessons from 5G network design. To compromise among the cost, capability and flexibility of the network, the features of the 6G mobile network are proposed based on the latest progress and applications of the relevant fields, namely, on-demand fulfillment, lite network, soft network, native AI and native security. Ultimately, the intent of this article is to serve as a basis for stimulating more promising research on 6G.},

  abstract={The present work aims to improve the communication security of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) nodes in intelligent transportation through studying the safety of IoV in smart transportation based on Blockchain (BC). An IoV DTs model is built by combining big data with Digital Twins (DTs). Then, regarding the current IoV communication security issues, a secure communication architecture for the IoV system is proposed based on the immutable and trackable BC data. Besides, Wasserstein Distance Based Generative Adversarial Network (WaGAN) model constructs the IoV node risk forecast model. Because the WaGAN model calculates the loss function through Wasserstein distance, the learning rate of the model accelerates remarkably. After ten iterations, the loss rate of the WaGAN model is close to zero. Massive in-vehicle devices in IoV are connected simultaneously to the base station, causing network channel congestion. Therefore, a Group Authentication and Privacy-preserving (GAP) scheme is put forward. As users increase during authentication, the GAP scheme performs better than other authentication access schemes. In summary, the Intelligent Transportation System driven by DTs can promote intelligent transportation management. Besides, introducing BC into IoV can improve access control’s accuracy and response efficiency. The research reported here has significant value for improving the security of the information sharing of the IoV.},

  abstract={In recent years, since the cloud can provide tremendous advantages regarding storage and computing resources, the industry has been motivated to move industrial control systems to the cloud. However, the cloud also introduces significant security challenges since moving control systems to the cloud can enable attackers to infiltrate the system and establish an attack that can lead to damages and disruptions with potentially catastrophic consequences. Therefore, some security measures are necessary to detect these attacks in a timely manner and mitigate their impact. In this paper, we propose a security framework for cloud control systems that makes them resilient against attacks. This framework includes three steps: attack detection, attack isolation, and attack mitigation. We validate our proposed framework on a real testbed and evaluate its capability by subjecting it to a set of attacks. We show that our proposed solution can detect an attack in a timely manner and keep the plant stable, with high performance during the attack.},

In this paper, we advance the integration of W3C's Web of Things (WoT) standards with DLTs and smart contracts, introducing smart contracts as “Digital Twins” of (physical) devices, or whole Cyber-Physical subsystems. Namely, we introduce a DLT-based architecture for controlling devices across federated IoT systems, securely, reliably, and with full auditability. The proposed architecture provides mass actuation and service composition with notable security properties, such as full auditability, transparency, and high availability. Specifically, a single request, with multiple action parameters and conditions, can trigger the reliable and secure actuation of a large number of possibly physically dispersed actuators.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the IoT ecosystem is evolving rapidly, with multiple heterogeneous sources producing high volumes of data and processes transforming this data into meaningful or “smart” information. These volumes of data, including IoT data, need to be stored in repositories that can host raw, unprocessed, relational and non-relational types of data, such as Data Lakes. Due to the weakness of metadata management, security & access control is one of the main challenges of Big Data storage architectures as Data Lakes can be replaced without oversight of the contents. Recently, the Blockchain technology has been introduced as an effective solution to build trust between different entities, where trust is either nonexistent or unproven, and to address security and privacy concerns. In this paper we introduce DLMetaChain, an extended Data Lake metadata mechanism that consists of data from heterogeneous data sources which interact with IoT data. The extended mechanism mainly focuses on developing an architecture to ensure that the data in the Data Lake is not modified or altered by taking into advantage the capabilities of the Blockchain.},

  pages={2428-2435},
  abstract={The adaption of the NFT to the mainstream web3 marketplace has led to the rise of challenges like authenticity and verification. On the other hand, privacy-preserving is one of the important research topics in the data-driven metaverse due to its anonymity while maintaining transparency and security. As the traditional method does not preserve privacy, there is a dire need for a novel privacy-preserving method for NFT authentication while preserving anonymity, transparency, and security. This paper proposes a smart card-based approach for privacy preservation authentication of Non-Fungible Tokens using Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof (NIZKP). The paper presents a Novel NIZKP response with the integration of challenge and proof with the encapsulation of a time-based one-time password (TOTP) solution to address the most critical problem of the proof of the source of the NFT and its rightful owner. The proposed solution is a lightweight mechanism for preventing unauthorized and hostile agents from the accessibility of the system while maintaining privacy and anonymity along with the verification and authenticity of the NFT. We have implemented our approach and compared the communication overhead and functional security features with related work and its precedence over them. The results show that the proposed approach has less communication overhead than the existing work and fulfills all the functional security and privacy-preserving features. It indicates that the proposed method can be an ideal solution for NFT authentication and transaction among users.},

  abstract={This paper studies the countermeasure design problems of distributed resilient time-varying formation-tracking control for multi-UAV systems with single-way communications against composite attacks, including denial-of-services (DoS) attacks, false-data injection attacks, camouflage attacks, and actuation attacks (AAs). Inspired by the concept of digital twin, a new two-layered protocol equipped with a safe and private twin layer (TL) is proposed, which decouples the above problems into the defense scheme against DoS attacks on the TL and the defense scheme against AAs on the cyber-physical layer. First, a topology-repairing strategy against frequency-constrained DoS attacks is implemented via a Zeno-free event-triggered estimation scheme, which saves communication resources considerably. The upper bound of the reaction time needed to launch the repaired topology after the occurrence of DoS attacks is calculated. Second, a decentralized adaptive and chattering-relief controller against potentially unbounded AAs is designed. Moreover, this novel adaptive controller can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded convergence, whose error bound can be given explicitly. The practicability and validity of this new two-layered protocol are shown via a simulation example and a UAV swarm experiment equipped with both Ultra-WideBand and WiFi communication channels.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the networking and communications problems of creating a digital copy in the Metaverse digital twin. Specifically, a virtual service provider (VSP) which is responsible for creating and rendering the Metaverse, is required to use the data collected by IoT devices to create the virtual copy of the physical world. However, due to the huge volume of the collected data by IoT devices (e.g., images and videos) and the limited bandwidth, the VSP might become unable to retrieve all the required data from the physical world. Furthermore, the Metaverse needs fast replication (e.g., rendering) of the digital copy adding more restrictions on the data transmission delay. To solve the aforementioned challenges, we propose to equip the IoT devices with semantic information extraction algorithms to minimize the size of the transmitted data over the wireless channels. Since many IoT devices will be interested to sell their semantic information to the VSP, we propose a truthful reverse auction mechanism that helps the VSP select only IoT devices that can improve the quality of its virtual copy of objects through the semantic information. We conduct extensive simulations on a dataset that contains synchronized camera and radar images, and show that our novel design enables a fast replication of the digital copy with high accuracy.},

  abstract={The metaverse is an advanced digital world where users can have interactive and immersive experiences. Users enter the metaverse through digital objects created by extended reality and digital twin technologies. The ownership issue regarding these digital objects can be solved by the blockchain-based nonfungible token (NFT), which is of vital importance for the economics of the metaverse. Users can utilize NFTs to engage in various social and economic activities. However, current NFT protocols expose the owner’s information to the public, which may contradict with the privacy requirement. In this article, we propose a protocol, NFTPrivate, that can realize anonymous and confidential trading of digital objects. The key idea is to utilize cryptographic commitments to hide users’ addresses. By constructing proper zero-knowledge proofs, the owner can initiate privacy-preserving yet publicly verifiable transactions. Illustrative results show that the proposed protocol has higher computation and storage overhead than traditional NFT protocols. We think this is an acceptable compromise for privacy protection.},

  abstract={Vehicle-to-X (V2X) with specific user-defined performance metrics emerges as one vital application scenario in sixth generation (6G) networks. According to released reports and whitepapers, 6G networks are designed to have softwarization attributes. Through softwarization, tailored V2X services, constituted by softwarized (resource and function) blocks, can be deployed on top of underlying network appliances. Chaining these softwarized blocks in predefined order is abbreviated as service function chain (SFC). However, existing SFC studies are conducted on the assumption that no performance descending of network appliance exists. Due to inherent shortcomings of softwarization, the softwarized 6G network appliances will bring about performance descending, compared with dedicated hardware. Emerging digital twin (DT) technology paves one way for studying SFC placement and scheduling without worrying about performance descending. By creating a digital replica of softwarized 6G networks, tailored SFCs can be implemented efficiently. This article investigates the SFC placement and scheduling in DT-em-powered softwarized 6G networks for emerging V2X. First, a novel business model and a problem model are presented. Next, one framework design, abbreviated as DT-SFC-6G, is proposed, including all technical details. The DT-SFC-6G design guarantees to provide efficient placement and scheduling solution per SFC request and feedback SFC solution and digital replica's state to softwarized 6G networks in time. Furthermore, experimental work of DT-SFC-6G is conducted. A variety of SFC algorithms, inserted in the DT-SFC-6G design, are evaluated in order to highlight the feasibility and merits of DT-SFC-6G. Finally, three most promising directions of SFC in DT-empowered softwarized 6G networks are selected for discussions.},

  abstract={Power system operation is gaining complexity due to the changes imposed by the energy transition. Especially, the increased share of intermittent and decentralized renewable generation units in the energy mix, an increased uncertainty regarding the supply of energy, and the predominantly market-driven cross-region and cross-border transport of electricity impose new challenges on the operation of power systems in Europe. In particular, power system operators must facilitate higher utilization of the grid capacity and coordinate more with neighboring transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs). To deal with these new challenges, there is a pressing need to improve the observability and controllability of key system parameters to safeguard the reliability of power systems. Furthermore, the aforementioned developments and challenges go hand in hand with the need to improve the system resilience from the cybersecurity and system stability points of view. In the future, these challenges cannot be met without innovation towards intelligent decision support systems and assistant functions, which allow a look ahead combined with fast response and proactive actions. Here, the rather novel digital twin (DT) concept in combination with data-driven (i.e., machine learning) applications can be purposefully applied.},

  title={When Autonomous Vehicles Meet Accidents: A DT-Enabled Post-Accident Maintenance Scheme}, 
  year={2023},

  number={24},
  pages={22233-22245},
  abstract={The autonomous vehicles (AVs), as intelligent mobile robots, can undertake tasks to facilitate various computation-intensive services in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Due to hardware device failures or environmental identification errors, the AVs controlled by intelligent algorithms may cause accidents during driving. However, the existing studies in the post-accident stage lack the analysis of the impact degree of the accidents and the computing tasks undertaken by the AVs to determine the optimal maintenance strategy. In this article, we consider the accidents in a continuous period of time and design a digital twin (DT)-enabled post-accident maintenance scheme. Specifically, by considering the computing tasks undertaken by the AVs and the impact degree of the accidents, we first design a DT-enabled post-accident maintenance architecture. With the designed architecture, an optimal maintenance method under an incomplete information scenario is then proposed to help each accident AV decide its optimal maintenance strategy. Besides, based on the maintenance strategies of the AVs and the capacities of the maintenance service providers (MSPs), the two-way selection problem between the AVs and the MSPs in the continuous period of time is modeled as a dynamic matching game to obtain the optimal AV-MSP pairs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of the maintenance rate of the accident AVs, the average utility of the MSPs, and the average social welfare.},

  abstract={This work aims to improve the communication security of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based on digital twins (DTs). The related technologies of quantum communication are introduced to improve network communication. Firstly, the key DTs technologies in the construction of IIoT are expounded. Also, the characteristics of quantum communication are analyzed. Secondly, a channel encryption scheme based on quantum communication is proposed to ensure the communication security of IIoT. The scheme uses the five-particle entanglement state and two-particle bell state as entanglement channels to realize two-particle quantum teleportation. Finally, an Adaptive Key Residue algorithm is proposed based on the quantum key distribution mechanism. The algorithm verification suggests that the success rate of service distribution decreases with the increase in network load. When the service load reaches 1000, the Adaptive Key Residue algorithm can maintain a success rate of service distribution in the network higher than 0.6. Besides, the success rate of service distribution increases with the growth of the total key generation rate V and the key pool capacity C. The research results reported here are of great significance for realizing the secure communication of IIoT systems based on digital twins to ensure the effective operation of network communication and the secure transmission of data.},

  abstract={Decentralized systems can provide privacy, security, and immutability without relying on a central authority. In the context of the Internet of Things, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can be important facilitators for implementing IoT economies. IOTA is a public DLT, which was created to provide support for the Internet of Things. The IOTA protocol enables high transaction throughput at zero cost, while also being highly scalable. These characteristics make it possible to collect sensor data with transparency and security, using a distributed public network. Despite the great potential of IOTA as a distributed protocol for sensor data, there are still no studies that demonstrate how the connection between sensors and IOTA can occur, and what the characteristics and limitations of the system are. We began exploratory technological research which includes the modeling of a system that allows the integration of IOTA with sensors, using IOTA as the data layer. An implementation of the model has been developed, based on data collection from the Bosch XDK110 multisensor and a storage/visualization application. Because the IOTA protocol requires Proof of Work to send and broadcast data over the network, which takes a few seconds, it is not possible to have granular live data from sensors directly interacting with the DLT. However, we will study the case of an application that allows for this by buffering data and inserting it to the IOTA network at a rate that nodes can handle.},

  abstract={Over the last decade, society and industries have undergone rapid digitization that is expected to lead to the evolution of the cyber-physical continuum. End-to-end deterministic communications infrastructure is the essential glue that will bridge the digital and physical worlds of the continuum. We describe the state of the art and open challenges with respect to contemporary deterministic communications and compute technologies— 3GPP 5G, IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking, IETF DetNet, OPC UA as well as edge computing. While these technologies represent significant technological advancements towards networking Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), we argue in this paper that they rather represent a first generation of systems that are still limited in different dimensions. In contrast, realizing future deterministic communications systems requires, firstly, seamless convergence between these technologies and, secondly, scalability to support heterogeneous (time-varying requirements) arising from diverse CPS applications. In addition, future deterministic communication networks will have to provide such characteristics end-to-end, which for CPS refers to the entire communication and computation loop, from sensors to actuators. In this paper, we discuss the state of the art regarding the main challenges towards these goals: predictability, end-to-end technology integration, end-to-end security, and scalable vertical application interfacing. We then present our vision regarding viable approaches and technological enablers to overcome these four central challenges. In particular, we argue that there is currently a window of opportunity to establish, through 6G standardization, the foundations for a scalable and converged deterministic communications and compute infrastructure. Key approaches to leverage in that regard are 6G system evolutions, wireless-friendly 6G integration with TSN and DetNet, novel end-to-end security approaches, efficient edge-cloud integrations, data-driven approaches for stochastic characterization and prediction, as well as leveraging digital twins towards system awareness.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are deployed to monitor physical processes in critical cyber-enabled services like power generation. However, CPS ecosystems are typically designed without robust security. While it is important to ensure optimal performance of the Operational Technology (OT) environments, security cannot be overlooked. To modernize traditional OT services, 5G technology is being integrated. 5G technology offers low latency and high availability, making it a suitable infrastructure for managing and monitoring physical processes. How-ever, integrating 5G mechanisms into large-scale OT networks introduces new implementation and performance challenges. Therefore, this paper presents a 5G-enabled CPS architecture (5G-CPS) that describes the necessary components, services, and communication protocols and conducts feasibility study to integrate 5G technology in industrial control system networks to understand the performance merits. The 5G-CPS architecture aims to minimize implementation and operational challenges associated with integrating 5G technology into constrained OT.},

The IIoT is the Internet of Things (IoT) but in an industrial context, i.e., IIoT is used more to connect machines and devices in industrial environments. The IIoT has the potential to benefit from advances in artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce overhead costs. We provide an overview of the supervisory control and data acquisition system, a definition of IIoT, and how IIoT can offer industry greater potential for system integration to improve automation and optimization. In addition, five of the major IIoT protocols are discussed, namely, message queue telemetry transport, advanced messaging queuing protocol, constrained application protocol, data distribution service, and open platform communication unified architecture. We then identified key IIoT improvements for industrial automation. These are; efficient and low-cost systems, digital twin, machine failure prediction, real-time remote monitoring, and security. We then discussed the key research in the literature for each category. We presented some public IIoT datasets so that researchers can use them to develop new learning models to improve the security of IIoT systems. Finally, we discussed some of the limitations, recommendations, and future perspectives for developing IIoT-enabled systems.},

  abstract={An essential aspect of resilience within Cyber-Physical Systems stands in their capacity of early detection of faults before they generate failures. Faults can be of any origin, either natural or intentional. Detection of faults enables predictive maintenance, where faults are managed through diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper we focus on intelligent predictive maintenance based on a class of machine learning techniques, namely transfer learning, which overcomes some limitations of traditional approaches in terms of availability of appropriate training datasets and discrepancy of data distribution. We provide a conceptual approach and a reference architecture supporting transfer learning within intelligent predictive maintenance applications for cyber-physical systems. The approach is based on the emerging paradigms of Industry 4.0, the industrial Internet of Things, and Digital Twins hosting run-time models for providing the training data set for the target domain. Although we mainly focus on health monitoring and prognostics of industrial machinery as a reference application, the general approach is suitable to both physical- and cyber-threat detection, and to any combination of them within the same system, or even in complex systems-of-systems such as critical infrastructures. We show how transfer learning can aid predictive maintenance with intelligent fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis, and describe some the challenges that need to be addressed for its effective adoption in real industrial applications.},

  abstract={Automated crop pests and disease detection have fateful effects on food safety, leading to significant deterioration in agriculture products. The effects of crop diseases and pests can be so severe that a harvest may even be ruined entirely. Therefore, automatic recognition and diagnosis of crop disease is required in the agricultural field. However, Fast and accurate crop disease detection is still a challenging and error-prone task. Earlier, traditional methods were used to detect abnormalities in crops caused by fungus, pests and nutritional deficiency. Moreover, in some cases, it is time-consuming, expensive and impractical. To overcome these issues, experimental research is being performed into the use of image processing techniques for crop disease detection using machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, generative adversarial networks and the internet of things. In this study, a comprehensive literature review of current studies is performed in crop disease and pest recognition using image processing to extract the features and algorithms used in prediction studies. In particular, several models have reported better accuracy on specific data sets. In contrast, in the case of different data sets or field conditions, the performance of the models degraded significantly. Despite this, progress has been encouraging so far. Furthermore, different inputs gained from the literature indicate that the aforementioned techniques provide better accuracy in comparison with existing techniques. Additionally, a detailed study has been performed on several unresolved challenges to develop a framework for automated crop pests and disease detection to use in real field conditions.},

  abstract={Accurate reliability modeling of manufacturing systems results in reduced maintenance costs and increased profits. The growing research field of data-driven reliability modeling seeks to harness the abundance of data from Smart Manufacturing Systems to improve and automate reliability modeling processes. Many manufacturing systems, however, still collect very limited amounts and types of data (typically operational state logs of production resources), which, we believe, can still be made useful to extract meaningful and useful reliability models. This motivates the work-in-progress that we present in this paper, a proof-of-concept method that extracts reliability models from state logs of production resources with deterministic durations of activities. First, the process model of a manufacturing system is extracted using a simple, yet efficient algorithm. Second, the reliability distributions for each production asset are fitted and useful reliability insights are integrated into the previously extracted process model. We conduct experiments of our proposed method using state logs from a drone manufacturing environment that is part of our university Industry 4.0 laboratory. The results show that a high-level overview of a system and its reliability can be provided with minimal data requirements and limited expert knowledge of the system. To this end, we also propose possible extensions and further developments of our method to make it more applicable to more challenging scenarios.},

  abstract={We consider the question of how to treat existing, context-based test inputs when contextual conditions change. Simply ignoring the voided inputs reduces confidence in the correctness of the system under test (SuT). Instead, we suggest to adjust the parameters of those inputs to the new conditions in a way that retains their original intention. This often comprises behavioral assumptions, e.g., because of coverage or risk considerations. Transferred test inputs should consequently trigger similar behavior of the SuT within the new environment as the original ones did in the old. We formalize this claim by a distance function on test inputs which compares the expected reactions of the SuT. The more similar the responses, the closer the test inputs. The proposed metric can thus be used for guiding test input transfer. In addition to a recursive definition, we present an algorithm that utilizes neural models to estimate the metric by simply observing a given simulation which sketches the intended behavior of the SuT. As this approach seems to specifically match the prerequisites when testing proactive systems, motivation and first experiments consider a simplified instance of those: an exemplary smart vacuum system.},

  abstract={The proliferation of cyber-physical systems is driving the growing need to establish links between these systems and virtual environments. Particularly in the smart grid, the high costs of some devices and the imminent need to prevent manipulation of these devices in production environments make mechanisms that allow the manipulation of these physical objects in virtual environments necessary; this has been called a digital twin (DT). Conversley, cyberattacks are growing in all cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity is essential to the critical infrastructure of the smart grid. This work shows a small implementation of a DT system for smart metering systems in a smart home environment for testing cybersecurity issues. The results show that the use of DTs is feasible in various contexts of the smart grid, particularly in cybersecurity testing.},

  abstract={In post-disaster situations, search and rescue operations are actively supported by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology. As it is well known, UAV-based monitoring services require computational effort for in-network processing, which drones cannot easily support. This gives rise to the need to offload tasks to available and nearby network segments. However, the disruption caused by natural disasters often renders networks and services unavailable and unreachable. While some recent scientific contributions have already explored the idea of offloading computing tasks to support network elements in post-disaster situations, there is still a need to formulate a lightweight approach aimed at dynamically selecting suitable, trusted, and available network segments for in-network processing. In line with these premises, a novel service orchestration scheme for selecting the most suitable domain to offload processing tasks generated by drones is presented. Precisely, the conceived scheme addresses the domains affected by natural disasters and replaces them with available network segments for in-network processing, leveraging the Network Digital Twin representation. The adopted strategy employs a lightweight multi-criteria decision-making methodology to jointly consider the quality of service and trustworthiness parameters of the domains crossed by a drone. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is investigated through computer simulations. The obtained results demonstrate that the conceived approach offers up to 75.61% service availability for in-network processing compared to baseline techniques.},

  abstract={This article delves into the distributed resilient output containment control of heterogeneous multiagent systems against composite attacks, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, false-data injection (FDI) attacks, camouflage attacks, and actuation attacks. Inspired by digital twin technology, a twin layer (TL) with higher security and privacy is employed to decouple the above problem into two tasks: 1) defense protocols against DoS attacks on TL and 2) defense protocols against actuation attacks on the cyber–physical layer (CPL). Initially, considering modeling errors of leader dynamics, distributed observers are introduced to reconstruct the leader dynamics for each follower on TL under DoS attacks. Subsequently, distributed estimators are utilized to estimate follower states based on the reconstructed leader dynamics on the TL. Then, decentralized solvers are designed to calculate the output regulator equations on CPL by using the reconstructed leader dynamics. Simultaneously, decentralized adaptive attack-resilient control schemes are proposed to resist unbounded actuation attacks on the CPL. Furthermore, the aforementioned control protocols are applied to demonstrate that the followers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence, with the upper bound of the UUB convergence being explicitly determined. Finally, we present a simulation example and an experiment to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract={The smart city aims to enhance the efficacy of urban management and improve the quality of citizen life. This however faces a fundamental difficulty due to the inadequate data sharing among social entities, which has become one of the key barriers to the in-depth development of smart city, making wasted information resources and application silos ubiquitous. As an emerging communication paradigm, the digital twin network (DTN) has the potential to eliminate the data-sharing barrier in smart cities. By mapping the social physical entities (PEs) in the smart city to digital virtual agents, namely data twins (DTs), valuable data can be directly shared among the DTs over DTN without physical constraints, and form decisions that feedback and guide the operations of PEs. In this article, we explore the role of DTN in supporting the smart city and promoting data-sharing construction. We first introduce the basic concepts related to DTN and propose the architecture of DTN-enabled smart city. The key features of the DTN-enabled smart city are then discussed with an emphasis on the security and privacy issues with fundamental solutions around data sharing in the DTN-enabled smart city. As a case study, we investigate data sharing in the DTN-enabled smart city and design a secure and fair data-sharing mechanism. Finally, we propose open challenges for achieving a more reliable DTN-enabled smart city.},

  abstract={In the traditional industrial production line scenario, it is difficult to grasp the real-time operation of the equipment in the production line, which affects the decision-making and control of the overall production. At the same time, in the process of remote control and data processing of production line equipment using industrial Ethernet, it is easy to have cyber security accidents such as production data leakage. To address these problems, this paper designs a production line control system that combines digital twin technology as well as blockchain and prophecy machine technologies. This proposal explores three aspects, namely, the establishment of the virtual production line, the transmission and processing of realtime production data, and the real-time mapping and optimization adjustment of the production line; the technical means to build this system are introduced in detail, and the feasibility of this system is verified theoretically.},

  title={Digital Twins Based Intelligent State Prediction Method for Maneuvering-Target Tracking}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={3589-3606},
  abstract={Maneuvering-target tracking has always been an important and challenge work because the unknown and changeable motion-models can easily lead to the failure of model-driven target tracking. Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-target tracking scenes.},
