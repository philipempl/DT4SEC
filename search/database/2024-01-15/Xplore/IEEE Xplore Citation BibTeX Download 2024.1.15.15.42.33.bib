  abstract={The Metaverse is a network of 3-D virtual worlds supporting social connections among its users and enabling them to participate in activities mimicking real life. It merges physical and virtual reality and provides channels for multisensory interactions and immersions in a variety of environments (Mystakidis, 2022). The Metaverse is considered the third wave of the Internet revolution, and it is built on new and emerging technologies such as extended reality and artificial intelligence. Research on the impact of the Metaverse on education exploded in 2022. Here, we explore learning across the Metaverse and propose a new and innovative theoretical framework by reviewing literature and synthesizing best practices in designing metaverse learning environments. This ecosystem consists of four major hubs: 1) instructional design and performance technology hub; 2) knowledge hub; 3) research and technology hub; and 4) talent and training hub. Common to all four hubs are the factors in the three wheels: 1) infrastructure, business industry, and communication; 2) technology access and equity; and 3) user rights, data security, and privacy policy. We believe that this framework can help guide emerging research and development on the applications of the Metaverse in education. We also hope this article can serve as a launch pad for the special issue on the Metaverse and the Future of Education supported by the IEEE Education Society.},

  abstract={The virtual world created by the development of the Internet, computers, artificial intelligence (AI), and hardware technologies have brought various degrees of digital transformation to people’s lives. With multiple demands for virtual reality increasing, the metaverse, a new type of social ecology that can connect the physical and virtual worlds, is booming. However, with the rapid growth of data volume and value, the continuous evolution of the metaverse faces the demands and challenges of privacy, security, high synchronization, and low latency. Fortunately, the ever-evolving blockchain and intelligent networking technologies can be used to satisfy the trusted construction, continuous data interaction, and computing demands of the metaverse. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth review of the role and gains of blockchain, intelligent networking, and the combination of both in providing the immersive experiences of the metaverse. In this survey, we first discuss the development trend, characteristics, and architecture of the metaverse. Then, the existing work on blockchain, networking, and the combination of the two technologies are reviewed, including overviews, applications, and challenges. Next, applications of the metaverse are summarized, emphasizing the importance of the metaverse and the fields of development. Finally, we discuss some open issues, challenges, and future research directions.},

  abstract={With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data &#x0026; AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues.},

  abstract={In the coming 6G era, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been evolving towards 6G-enabled IoV with super-high data rate, seamless networking coverage, and ubiquitous intelligence by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Transfer Learning (TL) has great potential to empower promising 6G-enabled IoV, such as smart driving assistance, with its outstanding features including enhancing the quality and quantity of training data, speeding up learning processes, and reducing computing demands. Although TL had been widely adopted in wireless applications (e.g., spectrum management and caching), its reliability and security in 6G-enabled IoV were still not well investigated. For instance, malicious vehicles in source domains may transfer and share untrustworthy models (i.e., knowledge) about connection availability to target domains, thus adversely affecting the performance of learning processes. Therefore, it is important to select and also incentivize trustworthy vehicles to participate in TL. In this article, we first introduce the integration of TL and 6G-enabled IoV and provide TL applications for 6G-enabled IoV. We then design a secure and reliable transfer learning framework by using reputation to evaluate the reliability of pre-trained models and utilizing the consortium blockchain to achieve secure and efficient decentralized reputation management. Moreover, a deep learning-based auction scheme for the TL model market is designed to motivate high-reputation vehicles to participate in model sharing. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is secure and reliable with well-designed incentives for TL in 6G-enabled IoV.},

  abstract={Metaverse is becoming the new standard for social networks and 3D virtual worlds when Facebook officially rebranded to Metaverse in October 2021. Many relevant technologies are used in the metaverse to offer 3D immersive and customized experiences at the user’s fingertips. Despite the fact that the metaverse receives a lot of attention and advantages, one of the most pressing concerns for its users is the safety of their digital material and data. As a result of its decentralization, immutability, and transparency, blockchain is a possible alternative. Our goal is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of blockchain systems in the metaverse to properly appreciate its function in the metaverse. To begin with, the paper introduces blockchain and the metaverse and explains why it’s necessary for the metaverse to adopt blockchain technology. Aside from these technological considerations, this article focuses on how blockchain-based approaches for the metaverse may be used from a privacy and security standpoint. There are several technological challenegs that need to be addressed for making the metaverse a reality. The influence of blockchain on important key technologies with in metaverse, such as Artifical Intelligence, big data and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is also examined. Several prominent initiatives are also shown to demonstrate the importance of blockchain technology in the development of metaverse apps and services. There are many possible possibilities for future development and research in the application of blockchain technology in the metaverse.},

  abstract={Metaverse and intelligent transportation system (ITS) are disruptive technologies that have the potential to transform the current transportation system by decreasing traffic accidents and improving driving safety. The integration of Metaverse and transportation technology, called metaverse transportation system (MTS), can greatly improve the intelligence of real transportation system. The digital models built in MTS help to simulate the full life cycle of physical entities, which equip the virtual space with controllability and flexibility. In this article, we concentrate on the field of environment perception, which is the basic function of intelligent vehicles in MTS. To overcome the poor scalability of traditional environment perception methods, we develop the framework of parallel vision for ITS in metaverse (PVITS), consisting of construction of virtual transportation space, model learning based on computational experiments, and feedback optimization based on parallel execution. This article highlights opportunities brought by PVITS in terms of model precision and generalization improvement. Then, the challenges of PVITS are discussed, i.e., distribution difference between virtual and real transportation space, structure design and theoretical interpretation of vision models, and data security and privacy in virtual transportation space. After that, we present several solutions to tackle the application challenges and fully exploit the superior characteristics of PVITS while attenuating their negative side effects. Some potential applications are also given to represent the effectiveness and reliability of PVITS.},

  abstract={Sixth-generation (6G) space-air-ground integrated vehicular networks (SAGIVNs) are expected to provide customized edge computing services for moving vehicles (MVs). In this article, by integrating 6G SAGIVNs and edge computing, we propose a secure and personalized vehicular edge computing framework in 6G to satisfy the diversified requirements of MVs. In the framework, we first develop a collaborative edge computing mechanism, where each 6G infrastructure (e.g., satellite, drone, and base station) cooperates with parked vehicles to provide services for MVs in order to improve the efficiency of the edge computing services. Then, considering the security issues, a smart-contract-based secure collaboration mechanism is designed to establish a reliable transaction environment for edge computing in 6G. Next, based on the personalized service requirements of MVs and the available resources in 6G SAGIVNs, the resource allocation strategy of each infrastructure and the competitiveness of different infrastructures are discussed to provide MVs with the optimal personalized service. After that, compared with the conventional schemes, a case is studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline open research topics to identify future research opportunities and directions.},

This article is committed to explore new management framework, model, paradigm, and solution for organizing, managing, and measuring knowledge works. First, the parallel management framework is presented that would allow for the virtual-real interactions of humans in social space, robots in physical space, and digital humans in cyberspace to realize descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive intelligence for management. Then, the management foundation models are proposed by fusing scenarios engineering with artificial intelligence foundation models and cyber–physical-social systems.

  pages={30373-30389},
  abstract={Medical devices play a crucial role in the global healthcare system, but their high cost has led to the increasing adoption of refurbished medical devices as a sustainable alternative for hospitals and patients around the world. The repositioning of refurbished devices into the market, however, is accompanied by a number of challenges, including concerns about quality and safety, as well as the risk of fraudulent activities such as counterfeiting. To address these challenges, we propose an NFT-based solution for managing refurbished medical devices that creates a secure, transparent, and verifiable record of the refurbishment process to ensure the safety and quality of these devices. The proposed solution utilizes dynamic composable NFTs as digital representations of medical devices, with replacement parts and certificate documents embedded in a parent-child NFT hierarchy, and reprocessing steps captured and reflected through the evolution of the dynamic tokens. This serves to authenticate and track the movement of refurbished devices while also providing a trustworthy means of managing individual devices and their ownership. Furthermore, the integration of non-transferable NFTs as certificates of refurbishment acts as an effective mechanism for detecting suspect medical devices and instances of fraudulent labeling, thereby increasing buyer confidence and promoting user safety. We leverage the Interplanetary File System to store and keep track of the metadata of the tokenized components of the system. We present the system architecture and implementation details with tested algorithms. We develop a front-end decentralized application (DApp) to interact with the designed smart contracts and showcase their functionalities. We also conduct security analysis to demonstrate our system is resistant to common vulnerabilities and exploits. The smart contract code is made available on GitHub.},

This paper aims to provide insight into the various potential applications of an AI-XR surgical metaverse and the challenges that must be addressed to bring its full potential to fruition. It is important for the community to focus on these challenges to fully realize the potential of the AI-XR surgical metaverses. Furthermore, to emphasize the need for secure and robust AI-XR surgical metaverses and to demonstrate the real-world implications of security threats to the AI-XR surgical metaverses, we present a case study in which the "an immersive surgical attack" on incision point localization is performed in the context of preoperative planning in a surgical metaverse.},

  abstract={Satellite networks, as a recent deployment for technical and economic progress, have shown great advantages to provide diversiform Internet services. However, the networks are grappling with severe congestion caused by a surge in simultaneous requests, which has become more prevalent due to the widespread adoption of satellite constellations. The reuse of satellite components or orbital computing is a practicable method to detach this hindrance, but current approaches have only achieved customized services, and limited access, as well as one-way profits with satellites serving users. Additionally, the unrecorded distribution and centralized management of satellite networks may result in contentious interaction and exposed infrastructure. In this article, we first propose an architecture of Deep-reuse-enabled Common Satellite Network via Collaborative Blockchains (named DCSN-CB), where the notion of deep reuse is described from resources and information. Then, we highlight potential security and efficiency issues faced by DCSN-CB from the viewpoint of authentication, command control, and data management. As a countermeasure, we outline the prospective blockchain-based technologies, namely, the cross-domain authentication, digital-twins-enabled edge computing, and data auto-audit. The further estimations of these solutions indeed demonstrate their feasibility. Finally, we point out several interesting directions for future efforts in this emerging field.},

  year={2023},
  volume={32},
  number={},
  pages={980-994},
  abstract={Nucleus segmentation is a challenging task due to the crowded distribution and blurry boundaries of nuclei. Recent approaches represent nuclei by means of polygons to differentiate between touching and overlapping nuclei and have accordingly achieved promising performance. Each polygon is represented by a set of centroid-to-boundary distances, which are in turn predicted by features of the centroid pixel for a single nucleus. However, using the centroid pixel alone does not provide sufficient contextual information for robust prediction and thus degrades the segmentation accuracy. To handle this problem, we propose a Context-aware Polygon Proposal Network (CPP-Net) for nucleus segmentation. First, we sample a point set rather than one single pixel within each cell for distance prediction. This strategy substantially enhances contextual information and thereby improves the robustness of the prediction. Second, we propose a Confidence-based Weighting Module, which adaptively fuses the predictions from the sampled point set. Third, we introduce a novel Shape-Aware Perceptual (SAP) loss that constrains the shape of the predicted polygons. Here, the SAP loss is based on an additional network that is pre-trained by means of mapping the centroid probability map and the pixel-to-boundary distance maps to a different nucleus representation. Extensive experiments justify the effectiveness of each component in the proposed CPP-Net. Finally, CPP-Net is found to achieve state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available databases, namely DSB2018, BBBC06, and PanNuke.

This research focuses on a broader evaluation of the metaverse and its key elements and features of the metaverse. Even though metaverse is expected as a promising platform for information exchange and communication among internet users, it has several shortcomings such as requiring high-performance client terminals and a long response time in some cases.

  abstract={As a dedicated data-centric processor, data processing unit (DPU) can release central processing unit (CPU) from the heavy computation load of data-intensive applications such as data encryption and decryption. In mobile edge computing (MEC), the integration of DPU structure into the MEC server can significantly reduce the processing delay of security-critical tasks. This paper studies the partial offloading problem oriented toward a DPU-enabled MEC system, in which the DPUs are responsible for all computation burden of data encryption/decryption. The objective is to minimize the completion time of security-critical tasks under an energy constraint. We introduce a new EDA-based metaheuristic (NEDA) to solve the resultant optimization problem. By using a task sequence to represent an offloading solution, this algorithm employs a task dispatching strategy to make partial offloading decision for each task in the sequence such that the solution quality can be evaluated. To enhance NEDA’s solution exploration capability, we develop a new population updating mechanism that relies on the current best solution and a probability matrix to generate a new population of high-quality solutions. Experimental results demonstrate NEDA’s effectiveness in solving the partial offloading problem in terms of task completion time.},

  pages={921-928},
  abstract={In recent years, Android application privacy leaking issues frequently occur, with the results that privacy leakage detection becomes a critical role in app market security review, and numerous mobile apps have been removed from the app stores as a consequence. At the same time, manual review is still considered as a main method for market security audit, but it would cause low efficiency and high false positive when faced with thousands of auditing tasks. To overcome the above problems, this paper implements a large volume, automated detection of privacy leaks in Android applications via machine learning algorithms. In order to achieve a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of application behavior features, firstly, 2346 benign software from app market and 1912 malware identified by a national regulatory authority as leaking privacy in the past two years were selected and studied using a hybrid static-dynamic analysis. Then by developing novel sensitivity criteria, we opt privacy-sensitive key permissions and API calls that are highly relevant to privacy leakage behavior. Moreover, in order to improve the practicability of our system, this thesis systematically optimize the application exerciser on the Android emulator, and achieve average per-app analysis time with less than 2 minutes. Finally, the results of the comparison experiments reveal that the stacking ensemble learning algorithm displayed the best classification performance and achieved 97.81% in accuracy of privacy leakage behavior detection.},

  abstract={Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CPABE) technology is often used in data sharing platforms. Most of the existing CP-ABE schemes do not consider time-sensitive data, which may easily lead to some unpublished information being leaked in advance. Therefore, combining time and attributes, this paper proposes a decentralized, auditable, time-limited multi-authority attribute access control scheme (BMTAC) in a blockchain environment. It can solve the single point of failure problem, the trust problem, and the cross-domain problem in a multi-authority scheme. This scheme combines the Fabric Network to manage permissions of different organizations jointly. Different organizations’ CA(Certificate Authority) issue digital certificates for entities and generate time tokens for attributes. Smart contracts collect attribute and time tokens to encrypt and decrypt ciphertext data and reduce client communication and computing costs. Furthermore, the comparative experiments show that the BMTAC scheme with the added attribute time limit has a good time cost in encryption and decryption, effectively reducing the computing overhead of users. Finally, the analysis of the security model proves the security of the scheme.},

  abstract={Malware traffic is constantly evolving and remains destructive. The detection and classification of malware traffic is crucial for maintaining cyberspace security. Only by swiftly and accurately detecting and classifying malware traffic can user privacy and cyberspace security be effectively protected.In this paper, we propose FewFine, an approach for few-shot malware traffic classification based on transfer learning. We initially pre-train a detection model and two classification models with substantial quantity of malware and application traffic samples. For classifying new types of malware traffic accurately and promptly, we utilize transfer learning based on fine-tuning strategy and freeze several blocks in the pre-trained model. Utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained models, we leverage few samples of novel classes to perform accurate malware detection and classification. We execute extensive experiments on publicly available datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of FewFine. In model pre-training, with considerable number of samples, the accuracy of malware detection and classification can reach 0.99. The pre-trained models are saved for fine-tuning. When detecting and classifying novel malware traffic, FewFine can achieve the accuracy of 0.95 leveraging only 10 samples per class through fine-tuning the pre-trained model. It outperforms methods under comparison in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract={While the fifth-generation mobile network is being commercialized worldwide, researchers have recently started looking towards the next generation, called the 6G network. Unlike 5G and previous generations of wireless technologies designed to improve network performance for greater bandwidth, lower latency, and greater reliability, 6G ecosystems are considered a platform conducive to innovations in computing, artificial intelligence, connectivity and sensors, virtualization, and more. It is designed to meet the requirements of higher global coverage, greater spectral efficiency, and a reduced carbon footprint, emphasizing sustainability, equity, trust, and security through unprecedented architectural evolutions and technology. 6G will be an integrated network system that includes a traditional terrestrial mobile network, space network, and underwater network to provide ubiquitous network access. Even if studies on the vision of the 6G network have already been published, there is still a significant amount of ground to cover. There is no decision made yet regarding anything, and nothing has been ruled out. The focus of this study is to identify a complete picture of changes in architectures, technologies, and challenges that will shape the 6G network. The research results will provide indications for further studies on 6G ecosystems.},

ISA100 Wireless is the IEEE 802.15.4-compatible wireless networking standard “Wireless Systems for Industrial Automation: Process Control and Related Applications”. It features technologies such as 6LoWPAN, which renders it ideal for industrial Internet edge applications. The survey focuses on the state of the art research results in the frame of ISA100 Wireless from a holistic point of view, including aspects like communication optimization, routing mechanisms, real-time control, energy management and security. Additionally, we present a set of reference works on the related deployments around the globe (experimental testbeds and real-terrain installations), as well as of the comparison to and co-existence with another highly relevant industrial standard, WirelessHART. We conclude by discussing a set of open research challenges.},

  year={2022},
  volume={9},
  number={12},
  pages={9659-9674},
  abstract={The proliferation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) not only threatens the security of digital devices and infrastructure but also severely degrades IoT system performance due to the overly consumed network resources. With the knowledge of identity information of devices and signaling data, Internet service providers (ISPs) can detect and block DDoS traffic by monitoring the upstream IoT packets, and thereby, improve network efficiency. However, inspecting all data packets online for DDoS detection will significantly increase both the network delay and the computational overhead. Therefore, the packet sampling strategy is crucial for the defenders to detect DDoS attacks. To this end, this article formulates a Stackelberg game model to analyze the collaborative IoT packet sampling against DDoS attacks. Through the equilibrium analysis of the DDoS game, we derive the lower bound of packet sampling rate (PSR) that can effectively deter potential attackers. Unlike traditional offline detection, our proposed packet sampling strategy can support both the online detection and proactive prevention of DDoS traffic. As a use case, a multipoint DDoS defense framework is developed to address the IP spoofing in 5G networks based on the proposed packet sampling strategy, which deters DDoS attacks and reduces the packet sampling cost, and thereby, maximizes the IoT utility, compared with existing methods. In typical reflection attacks (in which no more than five packets of response are triggered by a request packet), our proposed scheme not only reduces more than 70% of the sampling rate but also demonstrates superior robustness against boundary condition variation.},

  abstract={As technology continually improves, industries need a way of capturing the change from physical to digital. The movement towards the use of cloud-based system controls resulted in the implementation of new sensors and software to older legacy systems. This has led to the development of cyber-physical systems, which allow for the physical machines to be controlled virtually. As more and more systems are converted to use digital systems, issues with security and inter-connectivity have begun to arise. Currently the three main targets for vulnerabilities within Industry 4.0 are the Devices, systems and networks. This has led standardization organizations to implement protocols and standards to ensure complete and secure data transmission. As standards and protocols continue to improve, industries such as food, oil, natural gas, and many others find great benefits in transitioning their machines to a more remote and cloud-based environment. By optimizing these machines companies have achieved greater efficiency, accuracy, reliability, and overall greater productivity.},

We focus on exercising and exploring use cases involving system-level coordination of vehicular electronics, sensors, and software. In current practice, such use cases can only be explored late in the design when all the relevant hardware components are available. Any design change, e.g., for optimization or security or even functional errors found during the exploration, incurs prohibitive cost at that stage. Our solution is a flexible, configurable prototyping platform that enables the user to seamlessly add new system-level use cases. Unlike other related prototyping environments, the focus of our platform is on communication and coordination among different components, not the computation of individual Electronic Control Units. We report on the use of the platform for implementing several realistic usage scenarios on automotive platforms and exploring the effects of their interaction. In particular, we show how to use the platform to develop real-time in-vehicle communication optimizers for different optimization targets.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is synergistic with various participating domains like smart healthcare, industrial IoT, and smart cities. With its massive potential, the Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) landscape occupies a sizable chunk of the future Internet and is still immature due to its lack of interoperability and data sustainability among IoT applications. Most of the existing CIoT deployments are vertical solutions comprising CIoT devices, gateways, and centralized cloud services, resulting in fragmented silos of data. We need a contemporary, decentralized, semantic, data-centric, and interoperable approach to overcome the integration issues and provide a seamless global ecosystem for CIoT applications. In this article, we introduce a futuristic decentralized ME-centric state-of-the-art architecture for CIoT that can overcome the challenges of and enhance the agility, scalability, resiliency, and security of CIoT systems. In a decentralized ME-centric prototype, we integrate edge computing with decentralized storage solutions and new cutting-edge technologies like digital twins and blockchain with semantic ontologies to design a comprehensive beneficial outlook for consumers.},

  abstract={Security attacks on sensor data can deceive a control system and force the physical plant to reach an unwanted and potentially dangerous state. Therefore, attack detection mechanisms are employed in cyber-physical control systems to detect ongoing attacks, the most prominent one being a threshold-based anomaly detection method called CUSUM. Literature defines the maximum impact of stealth attacks as the maximum deviation in the plant’s state that an undetectable attack can introduce, and formulates it as an optimization problem. This paper proposes an optimization-based attack with different saturation models, and it investigates how the attack duration significantly affects the impact of the attack on the state of the plant. We show that more dangerous attacks can be discovered when allowing saturation of the control system actuators. The proposed approach is compared with the geometric attack, showing how longer attack durations can lead to a greater impact of the attack while keeping the attack stealthy.},

With the recent advances in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and computational capabilities, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology can play an instrumental role to revamp current human activity recognition (HAR) systems. In this magazine, we investigate the potential of using LiDAR sensors as a novel technology enabling complex and real-time HAR applications. We first overview the HAR categories and the existing state-of-the-art technologies: video-based cameras, depth sensors, wearable devices, and WiFi. Afterward, we delve into the integration of LiDAR technology to perform HAR applications. Then, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of utilizing LiDAR technology for HAR and compare it with the existing techniques. Finally, we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed to enable advanced LiDAR-based HAR applications.},

  abstract={This work proposes a SmartData-based middleware to integrate Autonomous Systems Simulators and external tools. The interface models the data used on a simulator and creates an intermediary layer between the simulator and the external tools by defining the inputs and outputs as SmartData. A message bus is used for communication between SmartData following their interest relations. Messages are exchanged following a specific protocol such as CAN, TSTP, and EtherCat. However, the architecture presented is agnostic of protocol. The presented interface eases the integration of the autonomous system simulation with other simulators (e.g., Network Simulators), Cloud services, fault injection mechanisms, Digital Twins, and Hardware-in-the-loop scenarios. Moreover, this interface allows transparent, runtime component replacement and time synchronization, the modularization of the components of the system, and the addition of security aspects in the simulation. After presenting the interface proposed, we present a case-study application with an autonomous vehicle simulation using CARLA and measure the end-to-end delay and overhead incurred in the simulation.},

  pages={29630-29644},
  abstract={The realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) encompasses a broad spectrum of sensors that are integral to distributed smart manufacturing (DSM). The miscellaneous IIoT sensors deployed for DSM are distributed and operate in a hierarchical and federated structure. Nonetheless, fulfilling essential quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as ensuring security and privacy (integrity) while maintaining scalability and interoperability (robustness), poses a profound challenge for the DSM cloud service platform. Although blockchain technologies have been used to safeguard integrity, the first two generations have imposed constraints on robustness. In contrast, the third-generation blockchain, a.k.a. decentralized crosschain ecosystem, complements Web 3.0 and metaverse and can mitigate the constraints of previous generations. Moreover, blockchain-based ad hoc solutions for DSM use cases are abundant; they often suffer from limited adaptability and unique or homogeneous use cases from a software engineering perspective. A holistic architectural modeling process (AMP) leading to a software reference architecture (SRA) is preferred when alleviating ad hoc constraints. Therefore, we proposed an AMP for SRA for crosschain-based DSM that safeguards integrity while preserving robustness. In the work described in this article, we have conducted the following system—modeling process. First, we propose a novel software AMP for DSM. Second, we deduce a modeled SRA based on a crosschain. Third, we infer a modeled system architecture (SA). Empirical experiment results demonstrate that our proposed crosschain-based method outperforms the widely used on-chain-based method while achieving our objectives efficiently.},

  abstract={Today’s forest-based sector stands at a pivotal stage highlighted by the keyword sustainability and is correlated deeply with climate change, food safety, biodiversity, etc. In Europe, it is distinguished by a high degree of decentralization, technological and know-how heterogeneity, and labor intensity. Faced with the increasing complexity of distinct value-added chains, one frequently referenced approach refers to transferring the concept of Industry 4.0 into forestry, yielding Forestry 4.0. In this context, Digital Twins (DTs), 1-to-1 virtual replicas of the real world, enable novel technological solutions, processes, and individual business models. Although the concept of DTs is not unfamiliar, there is still a lack of practical examples or general software frameworks to implement model-based DTs in forestry, focusing on connectivity, interoperability, and security. Therefore, this paper proposes our software framework based on a modeling language termed ForestML 4.0. In addition, we present that the developed Internet of Things infrastructure S3I can provide DTs with connectivity and security. Finally, we provide two practical examples realized in a forestry-related research project in Germany to prove the feasibility of our framework.},

We explore several novel architecture concepts for the 6G era driven by a decomposition of the architecture into platform, functions, orchestration and specialization aspects. With 6G, we associate an open, scalable, elastic, and platform agnostic het-cloud, with converged applications and services decomposed into micro-services and serverless functions, specialized architecture for extreme attributes, as well as open service orchestration architecture. Key attributes and characteristics of the associated architectural scenarios are described. At the air-interface level, 6G is expected to encompass use of sub-Terahertz spectrum and new spectrum sharing technologies, air-interface design optimized by AI/ML techniques, integration of radio sensing with communication, and meeting extreme requirements on latency, reliability and synchronization. Fully realizing the benefits of these advances in radio technology will also call for innovations in 6G network architecture as described.},

A new service quality model is proposed based on a customizable utility function for each individual data flow.

While being heavily advocated by the industry, there are great in-terests from academia as it demands various technological support from both hardware and software research. There has been an extensive visionary discussion of metaverse lately, but there are few studies on its technical challenges and user experience in practice. To fill this critical gap, in this paper, we take a first look at Workrooms, arguably a premature metaverse product released by Meta (a.k.a. Face-book). The goal of our study is to gain an in-depth under-standing of the current state of the metaverse and identify potential issues for improvement. Through extensive meas-urement studies, we dissect the underlying network support and demand of Workrooms. Our investigation reveals sev-eral interesting findings. For example, Workrooms utilizes different network flows to transmit virtual content and real-time multimedia content separately. This might be a prin-cipled approach that should be adopted in general. On the other hand, the current design of Workrooms faces imper-ative scalability challenges that should be addressed in any large-scale metaverse platform.},

  abstract={The depth development and widespread application of edge intelligence technology based on the Internet of Things has led to edge-cloud collaboration and related research. In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things and the formation of super-city groups, the management characteristics of enterprises with multiple manufacturing plants served for headquarters have become increasingly obvious. The problem of order dynamic fluctuations caused by personalized customization requirements has become more prominent, which makes it impossible to do global long-period prediction or real-time short-period response relied solely on the cloud or edge. Therefore, this paper proposes a production system scheduling framework under the edge-cloud collaborative paradigm based on the dynamic fluctuation of orders under these background, and builds an edge-cloud collaborative scheduling model, which guarantees real-time distributed scheduling at the edge. It enabled the cloud to periodically predict the total completion time of production tasks at the headquarters based on the value-added data uploaded by the edge, and to support more accurate and efficient scheduling at the edge based on the prediction results. Finally, an example analysis proved the rationality of the scheduling mechanism and the effectiveness of the scheduling model. The proposed method can provide a certain reference for task scheduling in the edge-cloud collaborative production paradigm.},

  abstract={Voice interaction is helping to increase efficiency in many areas of human activity. However, most studies either research its general aspects or domestic applications. On the contrary, there is almost no research on using this technology in production field, although, the idea of retrieving data this way can be a successful solution for large production areas, where it is difficult to find the right display. The paper aims to develop the method of voice assistant's implementation as a part of Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) for production processes. The study includes creating a prototype of the voice assistant module based on Alice cloud voice service API from Yandex and Raspberry Pi 3 microcomputer. Main aspects of using voice assistants for accessing production data from a CPPS were described. A possible approach to the introduction of this technology is shown. And a working prototype has been successfully designed. The research shows the possibility of using voice control in production conditions and its potential effectiveness in data access automation.},

  abstract={The Web of Things (WoT) paradigm was proposed first in the late 2000s, with the idea of leveraging Web standards to interconnect all types of embedded devices. More than ten years later, the fragmentation of the IoT landscape has dramatically increased as a consequence of the exponential growth of connected devices, making interoperability one of the key issues for most IoT deployments. Contextually, many studies have demonstrated the applicability of Web technologies on IoT scenarios, while the joint efforts from the academia and the industry have led to the proposals of standard specifications for developing WoT systems. Through a systematic review of the literature, we provide a detailed illustration of the WoT paradigm for both researchers and newcomers, by reconstructing the temporal evolution of key concepts and the historical trends, providing an in-depth taxonomy of software architectures and enabling technologies of WoT deployments and, finally, discussing the maturity of WoT vertical markets. Moreover, we identify some future research directions that may open the way to further innovation on WoT systems.},

  abstract={IOTA Tangle is a distributed ledger technology (DLT), primarily designed for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks and applications. IOTA Tangle utilizes a direct acyclic graph (DAG) structure for the ledger, with its protocol offering features attractive to the IoT domain, over most blockchain alternatives, such as feeless transactions, higher achievable transactions per second (TPS), and lower energy consumption. The original IOTA implementation relied on a bootstrap centralized coordinator solution for consensus which limited its degree of decentralization and scalability. This concern, alongside other limitations to its adoption, such as lack of smart contracts, are being addressed with the release of IOTA 2.0. This update brings with it significant changes in order to remove the coordinator and achieve a scalable decentralized solution. To this end, this paper provides a technical overview of the key features of IOTA 2.0 while discussing their relevance and benefits for the wider IoT ecosystem. The paper also provides performance insights and future research directions for IOTA 2.0.},

  abstract={In the past decade, virtual reality (VR) technologies have become increasingly affordable, flexible, and accessible with the release of consumer versions such as the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive. The immersive and interactive experiences enabled by this technology offer relevant, innovative use cases and training methods in a wide variety of fields. Therefore, VR is becoming more relevant in many areas outside classic entertainment. These include, for example, medical applications, educational environments, industrial applications, and design applications. In particular, immersive simulations and experiences that would often be too dangerous, expensive, difficult or even impossible to perform can be experienced in a safe environment. In this paper, the potential of VR technologies for different areas of aerospace applications is demonstrated and discussed. A systematic literature review based on the PRISMA guideline is conducted to identify relevant publications and applications from the databases IEEE, ACM, and Scopus. The analysis focuses on identifying various use cases of VR in aerospace research, design, manufacturing, operations, maintenance and education. Furthermore, the benefits, potential challenges and relevant technologies are discussed. This paper is designed to give readers a good overview of the state-of-the-art in VR, focusing on use cases and the potential and challenges, and discussing relevant future scenarios for this application field.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought Internet connectivity to devices from different domains and with different constraints. This, however, requires system developers to have a deep understanding of the individual devices' functionalities to achieve a successful integration. The Thing Description (TD) standard from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is able to describe such device capabilities in a machine and human-readable format. While this standardization effort already provides many benefits to developers, the lack of easy-to-deploy virtual device instances introduces issues such as an increased risk for errors during the integration phase of IoT systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to create virtual instances of IoT devices based on their TD that act like the real device, which we call the Shadow Thing Method (STM). In the development and deployment stages of IoT systems, STM can be applied to deploy an instance to act as a smart proxy to address different problems, while requiring no programming experience or effort. We show for three different use cases that in addition to the simulation benefits, STM brings scalability, reliability, and safety to the existing IoT systems, making the adoption of IoT feasible for a wider audience.},

  pages={286-299},
  abstract={Microgrid (MG) is a small-scale, self-sufficient power system that accommodates various distributed energy resources (DERs), controllable loads, and future distribution systems. Networked microgrids (NMGs) are clusters of MGs, which are physically interconnected and functionally coordinated to enhance distribution systems in terms of economics, resilience, and reliability. This paper introduces the architecture and control of NMGs including nanogrid (NG) and MG. To accommodate variable DERs in NMGs, master and distributed control strategies are adopted to manage the high penetration of DERs, where master control focuses on economic operation, while distributed control focuses on reliability and resilience through active power sharing and voltage and frequency regulation. The initial practices of NG, MG, and NMG in the networked Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) campus microgrid (ICM) and Bronzeville community microgrid (BCM) in the U.S. are presented. The applications of the master and distributed control strategies are illustrated for the networked ICM-BCM to show their benefits to economics, resilience, and reliability.},

  abstract={This paper presents an industrial scenario that simulates a Manufacturing as a Service system for the execution of remote production orders built upon the implementation of emerging Asset Administration Shell (AAS) capabilities and International Data Space connectors. Static and dynamic information from industrial assets (presses and laser cutting machines) are modelled with new AAS submodels and the result is stored in an AAS manager/registration system. A manufacturing orchestrator discovers assets through the registry and completes production orders. The AAS registry allows the selection of assets with capabilities to perform tasks and also shares the AAS catalogue available in the system. The catalogue is shared with external parties through Data Space Connectors. Third party companies can launch manufacturing orders remotely using the same connectors. The paper validates the implementation of AAS components and IDS connectors in a manufacturing context where remote production orders can be securely activated.},

  abstract={Tokenization is a new means to monetize assets in new decentralized economies. New types of tokens allow for the tokenization of physical assets and real-world projects. They can also be used to monetize digital assets in Cyber-Physical Systems, as well as provide a decentralized means to authorize access to such devices and systems. This paper describes one such effort, where this new type of tokens acts as the basis for financing the construction of sustainable real estate (smart buildings), as well as provide a means for private investors (owners) and other interested third parties to gain access to revenue, as well as cyber-physical systems and digital twins within the constructed smart buildings, in an interoperable and transparent manner. Inter-operability with underlying systems and equipment is performed using IEEE P1451.99 IoT Harmonization interfaces. Monetization of underlying resources allows for advanced optimization of the process, in accordance with principles defined within Industry 4.0, smart cities, sustainability and quality of life for citizens.},

  abstract={The automobile industry is experiencing a drastic transformation due to the implementation of digital strategies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless and satellite sensor networks, data-driven solutions, and others across a vehicle life cycle. The implementation of cyber- physical systems (CPS) such as electric vehicles (EVs) into the transportation networks brings multiple positive impacts on society, the environment, and a country’s economy. As technology evolves and increases its incorporation into humans, cyber-physical systems become more complex—and electric vehicles are no exception. The ‘next-generation’ fleet of vehicles is bringing new features such as autonomous driving, charging methods, and regenerative braking mechanisms. Although EVs positively impact society, they also introduce a series of risks and challenges. Modern vehicles will be connected to the internet permanently, which means they will be prone to cyberattacks that can potentially target either the system itself or the consumer’s personal data, which can result in catastrophic events. This paper presents a review of recent literature on cyber challenges, risks, and threats modern electric vehicles face and proposes a research framework to direct academics and practitioners to address gaps in the implementation of EVs into existing and future transportation networks.},

Furthermore, the newly emerging industrial requirements on interoperability, reconfigurability, man-machine collaboration, and self-optimizing production necessitate the application of new networking paradigms. This paper provides an overview of the expectations and feasibility of modeling, communication, and networking challenges of digital twins for the upcoming revolution of Industry 5.0.},

  pages={1587-1599},
  abstract={Federated learning (FL) paradigms aim to amalgamate diverse data properties stored locally at each user, while preserving data privacy through sharing users’ learning experiences and iteratively aggregating their local learning models into a global one. However, the majority of FL architectures with centralized cloud do not guarantee the trust in sharing users’ models, and hence, open the door for slowing and/or contaminating the global learning experience. In this paper, we propose a decentralized Blockchain (BC)-based framework and define a comprehensive protocol for exchanging local models, in order to guarantee users’ mutual trust while sharing their local learning experiences. We then propose a technique to optimize the global learning experience using Reinforcement Learning (RL), namely RL-FL-BC, to tackle the trade-off between information age of the learning parameters, data skewness (i.e., non-iid), and BC transaction cost (i.e., Ether price). We implement the proposed framework in a realistic containerized environment to facilitate the comparative study of the RL-FL-BC technique with baselines techniques. Our results show the efficacy of the BC-based protocol to facilitate the exchange of both the models’ and the optimization parameters to guarantee users’ mutual trust, while improving global learning performance compared to baselines techniques.},

  abstract={Information systems are key facilitators for production planning, configuration, and monitoring in increasingly flexible Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), such as automated welding lines for joining car parts. The guideline VDI 2206 provides a V-model to organize the engineering disciplines. It emphasizes the importance of validation in CPPS engineering but provides limited guidance on the up-front specification and validation of test scenarios. This paper introduces the Production Test Scenario Validation (PTSV) approach to validate to what extent a multi-view CPPS design model and associated data sources from production engineering and operation represent the concepts used in test scenarios. The PTSV (i) elicits concepts in pre- and post-conditions of production test scenarios, (ii) maps these concepts to a multi-view CPPS design model, such as a production asset network, and (iii) identifies mismatches between production test scenarios and CPPS design models, such as missing model elements or data sources required for validation. We evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach in a feasibility study on a real-world welding line for joining car parts. The results indicate that the PTSV is feasible and effective for improving the capability to measure and analyze outcomes of test scenarios in CPPS engineering according to the VDI 2206.},

With increasing stress on healthcare systems, it has become crucial to explore the latest and cost-effective solutions that can provide fast and reliable medical services. The focus of this study, therefore, is to explore applications of metaverse in various health care systems and elaborate on how it can efficiently improve the clinical management of patients. Consequently, an in-depth assessment of the metaverse has been carried out, while covering its core fundamentals, key technologies, and diverse applications in healthcare and medicine, including but not limited to, emergency response learning, hands-on experience in anatomy learning, orthopaedics, paediatrics and so on. To carry out the study, we have used an exploratory approach to analyze qualitative data on healthcare metaverse services in our systematic review. Relevant articles from scientific databases such as Web of Science, Springer, Scopus, and IEEE have been identified, and the analysis has been conducted using the PRISMA reporting guideline to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting. The results of the study suggest that the metaverse has the potential to transform healthcare systems by introducing novel methods for delivering healthcare services. Metaverse’s AR/VR technologies can enable remote medical consultations and training, benefiting patients and healthcare professionals.

  abstract={The metaverse intersects with the real world to establish a new era for wireless applications over next generation networks. Nevertheless, these applications are accompanied with a spate of challenges that can hinder their anticipated emergence. In particular, these applications are essentially capped with the profound communication and computing limits pertained by classical networks and end devices. Hence, to reap the full metaverse experience, a major leap that propels the metaverse apart from the classical paradigm of communication, computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) is demanded. In this paper, we shed light on the potential and recent advancements of quantum technologies that can drive the metaverse beyond the classical boundaries. In particular, with the substantial breakthrough witnessed in the versatile quantum streams, we leverage the quantum communication, computing, sensing, and AI tools that can pave the way for a groundbreaking version of metaverse applications to emerge. Up to this end, we present an overview of the metaverse in terms of its aspects, components, and persisting challenges. Then, we elaborate further on the applicable quantum tools (e.g., quantum federated learning, quantum key distribution, etc.) that can transform the different metaverse operational levels (e.g., digital twins, extended reality, etc). Finally, we present a set of open challenges and future research directions that arise along the lines of adopting quantum technologies for future metaverse applications.},

  abstract={Human-Centric Sensing (HCS), a novel approach in the evolution of the Next Generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT), exploits the ubiquity of diverse smart devices, including smartphones or wearable devices, in conjunction with their enhanced sensing capabilities to collect information, leveraging human intelligence for the common benefit of the crowd. The main feature of HCS is the involvement of mobile users in data collection, processing, analysis and sharing. Thus, the main challenge in HCS systems is to ensure users’ participation and trustworthiness as well as data quality. The aim of this work is, as a first step, to identify and discuss the factors that affect data quality in HCS-based NG-IoT systems, as well as elaborate on their interrelation. Furthermore, potential solutions that could be adopted to ensure the highest possible degree of data quality are highlighted, in conjunction with critical aspects that should be considered, proposing a novel classification with three major categories: task assignment, reputation mechanisms and blockchain technology. Finally, a trust-aware task assignment model is proposed to effectively address the data quality challenge in HCS-based IoT systems, reflecting users’ trustworthiness, willingness, experience, and ability to collect and share high-quality data contributions. The proposed trust-aware task assignment model exploits a reputation mechanism and is designed using blockchain and smart contract technologies to enable the decentralized provision of trustworthy services among entities and preserve users’ privacy, harnessing the decentralization, transparency and immutability offered by blockchain. Trust-based task assignment offers an effective solution for trustworthy users’ selection while ensuring high-quality contributions and users’ privacy.},

  abstract={The Metaverse is an online universe that combines virtual reality and augmented reality, linked together via a network.It has generated novel experiences that are fully engaging and transpire in real time, facilitating interpersonal communication and dialogue. Virtual environments with 3D space and avatars can boost patient-facing platforms, operational utilisation, digital education, diagnostics, and treatment choices in medicine and ophthalmology. Globally, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, with an estimated 25 percent of individuals presently contending with multiple chronic health issues. The management of chronic diseases is currently being rethought in light of the development of technology known together as “Smart Healthcare.” A prime example is state-of-the-art wearable technology that incentivizes people to embrace healthier lifestyles through the monitoring of physiological indicators and metabolic processes. With better data organisation and analysis, chronic disease patients may benefit from improved health, privacy, and quality of life. Through the examination of physiological data acquired from wearable devices on a patient, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to generate informed recommendations pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of illness. These recommendations can be provided by AI. The adoption of blockchain technology (BC) has the potential to significantly advance healthcare in a variety of ways, including decentralised data sharing, user privacy, user empowerment, and dependability in data administration. The potential impact of Wearable Technologies (WT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain Technology (BC) on Chronic Disease Management (CDM) could be a transition in emphasis from the hospital to the patient. This article provides a patient-centered technical framework for controlling chronic diseases using artificial intelligence, blockchain, and wearable technologies. Our proposed architecture depends on Metaverse environment. In order to participate in the Metaverse, both patients and physicians need to sign up on the Blockchain network. After entering, customers will be accompanied by avatars throughout the experience. A comprehensive record of all information gathered during doctor-patient consultations, including text, videos, images, audio, and clinical data, will be compiled, uploaded to the blockchain, and stored in perpetuity. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms examine these particulars in order to diagnose and forecast the progression of diseases.

  abstract={To achieve flexible, resilient and sustainable production, the generation of dynamic cross-company supply chains gains importance. The Shared Production scenario aims at sharing manufacturing services within distributed production network through digital interfaces. A prerequisite is secure data sharing in a trustworthy network with certified participants and a common understanding concerning vocahulary, message structure and interaction patterns Gaia-X provides a solution for a secure and federated data infrastructure according to European values (ie., European Data Protection, transparency and trust). Asset Administration Shells (AAS) provide semantic and vendor-independent information models and VDI/VDE 2193 proposes message structure and interaction protocols for bidding procedures. In this paper, we present the combination of the three concepts to enable the Shared Production scenario. We elaborate on the requirements of Shared Production, develop a system architecture and model AAS Submodel templates to perform an automated bidding procedure. Additionally, the implementation is evaluated based on the bidding of production services to produce model trucks in a demonstrator ecosystem.},

  abstract={In recent years, Intent-based Networks (IBNs) have emerged as an effective approach for managing and optimizing complicated networks. However, contemporary IBN systems continue to struggle with understanding user intent and converting it into network configurations. To address this problem, this research presents an intent-based network empowered by knowledge graph (IBN-KG), which combines knowledge graph technology with IBN to enhance intent translation and management. We concentrate on the construction of a knowledge graph for grid scenarios and its application to improve IBN performance. The paper also introduces a tailored Knowledge Graph construction scheme for vertical industry applications, focusing on smart grid scenarios. This involves a distinct data layer, knowledge extraction through natural language processing, knowledge fusion, knowledge updating, and knowledge application through user interfaces. In summary, the integration of Knowledge Graph technology with IBN promises a more intelligent, flexible, and effective way of translating and managing user intent in network configurations, with particular emphasis on applications in smart grid scenarios.},

  pages={61-71},
  abstract={Today’s critical infrastructure systems are more interconnected and dependent on the electric power grid. This interdependence means that disruptions in one system can have far-reaching consequences across many others. This is particularly evident when a cyberattack in the power grid leads to widespread outages and disrupts essential societal services. To prevent such disasters, it is crucial that proactive actions are taken to secure our power grid control centers and digital substations. This is where digital twins (DTs) play an important role: By creating virtual replicas of cyberphysical assets and processes, DTs allow system operators to anticipate and address potential vulnerabilities in our cybersecurity defenses before they can be exploited. As such, a DT can be considered as a key contributor to safeguard the power system against cyberattacks. This article examines the potential future benefits of DTs in enabling a cybersecure and resilient power grid, explores multiple use cases, and proposes a path forward.},

In recent years, business ecosystems have become more and more important to create various values for customers. In changing environment, firms have to create the new business ecosystem's capabilities such as robustness, productivity, and niche creation, but it is not easy. Microsoft Azure IoT is a typical success case to create the new business ecosystem by transforming the existing ecosystem. This paper analyzes this case from dynamic capability and ambidexterity viewpoints, and proposes the 4D (Detection, Derivation, Direction, and Diversion) process model. The proposed model contributes to business ecosystem research by introducing dynamic capability and ambidexterity into the traditional static business ecosystem model. Firms can logically understand how to transform their business ecosystem to fit their business environment by using this model.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={One of the focuses of smart manufacturing technology is data management and processing. However, there are issues which is difficult to integrate the data within the enterprise, share industry chain data and obtain open data in the management and processing of existing industrial data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a construction method of industrial data decentralized distributed symbiotic sharing space (iDS3) based on tensor. The proposed method consists of three core steps. First, metadata is extracted from multi-source heterogeneous raw data; Second, a knowledge graph is constructed using industrial mechanism to enrich the metadata; Finally, tensors are used to store metadata and its corresponding unique identifier ID. A metadata encoding rule based on industrial mechanisms is adopted in this work, which can support tensor queries in different application scenarios, thereby achieving ubiquitous storage of data by solving the distributed symbiotic sharing of multi-source heterogeneous raw data. At present, the industrial data governance platform (iDGP) developed based on iDS3 has been applied to the data integration of industrial enterprises such as ships, integrated circuits and new energy vehicles, the integration development with various the third-party data processing tools, and application services of industry dataspaces and so on, which shows that iDS3 has been a successful solution for the development of technology-driven Industry 4.0 to value-driven Industry 5.0.},

The Blockchain-based Shared Manufacturing concept envisions a decentralized platform that facilitates trustless and efficient collaborations between manufacturers and consumers. While this approach addresses several challenges associated with traditional manufacturing and supply chain management, it also faces issues related to establishing trust among participants and addressing challenges with blockchain scalability, including transaction throughput, privacy, and interoperability. This paper presents an analysis of these challenges and proposes potential solutions, including horizontal scaling via layer 2 solutions and parallel chains, and the use of social graphs, NFTs, and Self-Sovereign Identity for trust and reputation management. By addressing these challenges, the shared manufacturing concept can transform the manufacturing industry, paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and secure ecosystem.},

More precisely, we review what factory assets need to be protected, how to detect anomalies that may indicate an ongoing cyberattack, how to mitigate cyberattacks against those assets, and how to initiate suitable countermeasures. Furthermore, we study how to recover factory assets after a cyberattack. We describe how software-defined networking, machine learning, and neural networks can be used to monitor factory assets, manage identities and control access to factory assets, detect adversarial attacks against artificial intelligence-embedded assets, and support resilient operations of future factories. These findings provide useful insights into design and operation of secure and resilient factories of the future.},

  abstract={Recently IoT edge devices have become more diverse and lower cost. In addition, small low-power single-board computers' computing performance has significantly increased. These conditions make it possible to process locally without communicating to the cloud. Since the advantages of in-edge processing are security and privacy, we applied in-edge IoT to smart homes with rich private information to be secured. In in-edge processing, conventional cloud-managed abnormality monitoring and system maintenance cannot be involved. We developed a lamp control system with in-edge processing. It detects failures using camera image processing and recovers from the failure. The abnormalities of the image processing are detected by monitoring cyclic outdoor brightness change observed on windows captured with the same camera. We have developed a prototype system with Python with OpenCV and FastAPI, etc., over PHP-based lamp timer control while keeping source code size small and considering validation easiness. The camera detectors work at 10 FPS on Python with as small as 1607 total source code lines (three times of code lines against the original lamp control timer).},

  abstract={Medical device quality and safety are important because they affect people's lives and health, and society has placed a high value on these factors. Healthcare supply chain has been majorly intruded for fake medical devices and technologies. Products that are counterfeited are frequently created to reach profit from the original product's lower price. Because of its high risk, a traceability system must be set up. Most businesses are making greater efforts to prevent counterfeiting. The QR code system presented in this project is application-, security-and privacy-focused. The existing system uses non-fungible token (NFT) based solution that enhances the tokenization protocols. In our paper we propose the usage of QR technology. It is easy and affordable to create a QR code for a medical device's identification. Because QR codes are simple to use. This system stores the information in decentralized storage of the Blockchain technology system to verify the legitimacy of medical equipment, ensuring that users are not dependent on outside apps. Blockchain which is defined as the distributed ledger system that is based upon apowerful cryptographic technique and is used to capture and preserve information about medical devices, making it difficult for anybody to tamper with them. Along with Blockchain, the usage of decentralized system makes the privacy of the data more effective. The paper also allows the customer end to view and verify the medical device ownership.},

  pages={1702-1709},
  abstract={Raft is a consensus algorithm to coordinate the proper execution of protocols and rules within the system. Owing to its security and simplicity, it can be applied to the field of IoT with blockchains. When IoT device clusters run under the Raft consensus algorithm, as the number of devices increases, split voting is prone to arise, therefore the Raft algorithm cannot run efficiently under large-scale nodes. To improve the problem of split voting and delay in system recovery after a leader collapse (DISR), this paper proposes a high-fault-tolerant consensus algorithm based on synergistic collaboration of multi leaders within the IoT clusters—MCRaft. The concept of super node cluster is introduced. MCRaft elects three leaders to form a super node cluster mapping single Raft leader. The election of the MCRaft node is verified through the log hash stored by the node, and the voting overhead of the cluster is born by the node’s own computing power instead of relying on the voting mechanism, making the election of leaders more efficient and secure. According to the experiments, the synergistic collaboration of the super node clusters effectively prevents DISR issue hence achieve efficient transmission, improving the fault tolerance of the IoT cluster. MCRaft algorithm improves the election efficiency by about 84% compared with that of common Raft algorithm within 100 nodes. 200 crash experiments indicates that the MCRaft algorithm improves its stability by about 24% on average compared with that of common Raft.},

Many studies on key enabling technologies for resource organization and system operation of blockchain-secured smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0 had been conducted. However, the progression and promotion of these blockchain applications have been fundamentally impeded by various issues in scalability, flexibility, and cybersecurity. This survey discusses how blockchain systems can overcome potential cybersecurity barriers to achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0. In this regard, eight cybersecurity issues (CIs) are identified in manufacturing systems. Ten metrics for implementing blockchain applications in the manufacturing system are devised while surveying research in blockchain-secured smart manufacturing. This study reveals how these CIs have been studied in the literature. Based on insights obtained from this analysis, future research directions for blockchain-secured smart manufacturing are presented, which potentially guides research on urgent cybersecurity concerns for achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0.},

Currently, academia and industry have focused their attention on the Sixth Generation (6G) network, which is anticipated to be the next big game-changer in the telecom industry. The outbreak of COVID'19 has made the whole world to opt for virtual meetings, live video interactions ranging from healthcare, business to education. However, we miss an immersive experience due to the lack of supporting technology. Experts have anticipated that starting from the post-pandemic age, the performance requirements of technology for virtual and real-time communication, the rise of several verticals such as industrial automation, robotics, and autonomous driving will increase tremendously, and will skyrocket during the next decade. In this manuscript, we study the latest perspectives and future megatrends that are most likely to drive 6G. Initially, we describe the instances that lead us to the vision of 6G. Later, we narrate some of the use cases and the KPIs essential to meet their performance requirement. Further, we highlight the key requirements of 6G based on contemporary research such as UN sustainability goals, business model, edge intelligence, digital divide, and the trends in machine learning for 6G.},

  abstract={With 5G mobile communication systems having been commercially rolled out, research discussions on next generation mobile systems, that is, 6G, have started. On the other hand, vehicular technologies are also evolving rapidly, from connected vehicles called V2X (vehicle to everything) to autonomous vehicles to the combination of the two, that is, the networks of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV). How fast the evolution of these two areas will go hand-in-hand is of great importance, which is the focus of this article. After a brief overview of the technological evolution of V2X to CAV and 6G key technologies, this article explores two complementary research directions, namely, 6G for CAVs versus CAVs for 6G. The former investigates how various 6G key enablers, such as THz, cell free communication and artificial intelligence (AI), can be utilized to provide CAV mission-critical services. The latter discusses how CAVs can facilitate effective deployment and operation of 6G systems. This article attempts to investigate the interactions between the two technologies to spark more research efforts in these areas.},

  abstract={With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, cyber-physical systems (CPS) have revolutionized the engineering paradigm with profound applications in many aspects of society including homes, energy, agriculture, health-care, transportation, business, and manufacturing. A CPS uses suitable computational techniques such as game theory to enable different entities to interact with one another for taking necessary actions to obtain selected objectives. Recent literature on CPS has extensively used game theory to approach a variety of technical challenges. In order to make these contributions more accessible to a broader audience, there is a need for studies that can provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of different types of CPS and their attributes, then clearly outline why game theory is relevant for modeling different aspects of CPS, and also discuss how game theory has been used in relevant literature to date. This paper bridges this gap by 1) providing a general discussion of different types of CPS and their characteristics; 2) giving an overview of different types of game-theoretic approaches; 3) explaining why game theory is appropriate for modeling different types of CPS; and 4) finally, studying how game theory has been used in different CPS types to address their challenges. Further, we also identify some key research challenges for future investigation where game theory could be applied as a potential solution.},

  abstract={Emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are revolutionizing computing and data processing approaches with their strong impact on society. Data is processed with automated labelling pipelines rather than providing it as input to the system. The innovative nature increases the overall performance of monitoring/detection/reaction mechanisms for efficient system resource management. However, due to hardware-driven design limitations, networking and trust mechanisms are not flexible and adaptive enough to be able to interact and control the resources dynamically. Novel adaptive software-driven design approaches can enable us to build growing intelligent mechanisms with software-defined networking (SDN) features by virtualizing network functionalities with maximized features. These challenges and critical feature sets have been identified and introduced into this survey with their scientific background for AI systems and growing intelligent mechanisms. Furthermore, obstacles and research challenges between 1950–2021 are explored and discussed with a focus on recent years. The challenges are categorized according to three defined architectural perspectives (central, decentral/autonomous, distributed/hybrid) for emerging trusted distributed AI mechanisms. Therefore, resiliency and robustness can be assured in a dynamic context with an end-to-end Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for growing intelligent mechanisms and systems. Furthermore, as presented in the paper, the trust measurement, quantification, and justification methodologies on top of Trusted Distributed AI (TDAI) can be applied in emerging distributed systems and their underlying diverse application domains, which will be explored and experimented in our future related works.},

  abstract={When it comes to digitalization, construction sites are still at the beginning of an ongoing transformation process. Two major causes are the complexity of construction site environments and the lack of interoperability between the different actors, such as machines and site suppliers that are involved in the construction project. This has direct implications on the efficiency, quality, and production time of construction projects. Thus, there is a strong need to fill this digitalization gap by considering the latest advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as edge and cloud computing. In this paper, we suggest a data-driven approach for construction sites, in which we extract data from machines, send it to a central data storage with scalable computational resources and analyze it to improve the existing construction processes. For that, we studied requirements of selected construction site processes and designed a communication architecture that scales with the complex characteristics of real-world applications. Additionally, we propose a digital process platform that supports a wide range of users with their different roles on construction sites and builds the foundation for further research, implementation, and evaluation of according construction site innovations. With the proposed platform framework, we extend the construction site towards an integrated Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and contribute to the standardization of communication infrastructures within the construction sector by merging different solutions from the area of information and communication technologies.},

As the main RAMI4.0 specification, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is a standard digital representation of an industrial asset that plays a pivotal role in enabling interoperable communication among I4.0 components across the value chain. This paper provides an analysis of the current state-of-the-art of implementing AAS, discussing, amongst others, the key enabling technologies used to implement the AAS and the alignment of the research works found in the literature with the I4.0 components criteria.},
