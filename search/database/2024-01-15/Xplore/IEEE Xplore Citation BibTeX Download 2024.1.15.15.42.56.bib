  abstract={Industry 4.0 has come to the attention of companies as it enables to highly networked smart factories and leveraging of complex manufacturing processes. How to achieve trustworthy interoperability among several heterogeneous entities and also among companies is still a challenge; however, hence, there is a strong focus on research, standardization initiatives, and adaptation of solutions from other areas. Yet, companies interested in Industry 4.0 do not have any guidance on what solutions or concerns should be considered to architect Industry 4.0 systems that assure trustworthy interoperability. This article contributes a set of essential requirements for assuring a trustworthy interoperability in Industry 4.0. We first identified the main challenges regarding interoperability in real-case Industry 4.0 projects. Then, we designed a set of architecture drivers combining such challenges with quality aspects extracted a systematic literature review. We refined these drivers based on a rigorous survey with experts from Industry 4.0. As a result, we found seven architecture drivers: Authentication to the system, data access control, data privacy to protect sensitive information, traceability and auditability of data, availability of physical devices, availability of data, and compatibility of data and services. We recommend adopting all these drivers jointly to assure trustworthy interoperability, which is such an important factor for Industry 4.0.},

  abstract={Metaverse is the latest technological hype in the modern world due to its potential for revolutionizing the digital visual perspective. With the COVID-19 pandemic, most industries have moved towards digitization, and the metaverse is identified as one of the most promising platforms for such a transition, as it provides a three-dimensional (3D) immersive experience for the users. Currently, most digital service providers and organizations are actively working on metaverse- based applications. In addition, there has been a rapid increase on research work involving metaverse realization. Launching a large scale metaverse in the real world is a challenging task. However, fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) technologies are envisioned to improve the feasibility of pragmatic deployments. Although, there are several conceptual designs available, actual adaptations of the concepts are still limited. This survey focuses on providing a practical approach for metaverse realization using 5G and B5G technologies. Specifically, We discuss the importance of network slicing (NS) and multi-access edge computing (MEC) as emerging 5G technologies for enabling the realization of the metaverse. We first introduce the motivation behind metaverse for future envisaged technologies. Next, we present a holistic high-level framework for metaverse realization based on network slicing and edge computing. Moreover, we discuss the futuristic metaverse applications, their technical requirements, and methods to satisfy the requirements. Finally, we highlight the deployment challenges and possible approaches to overcome them for an actual metaverse realization.},

Power, heating, transport, building and industry sectors are progressively more interconnected. In addition, new business models and innovative technological solutions are driving change in the power industry. The new system being unfolded requires a much higher level of flexibility and coordination. The increased complexities can only be mitigated by actively managing the energy supply chain. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to play a key role in numerous areas such as demand forecasting, predictive maintenance, energy management and customer support. Among digital technologies, AI is the one with the highest adoption rate in the power sector. Considering the growing importance of AI, the paper analyses the current status and future prospects of the technology in the power industry. It also explores different issues and barriers to its wider adoption. The review of possible applications is conducted by analysing academic literature and by observing numerous companies around the world that are developing and implementing AI solutions on the grid’s edge.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe a decentralized demand response solution for energy communities based on blockchain and peer-to-peer energy flexibility trading. The solution is built on top of a blockchain energy ledger that stores and shares energy transactions based energy data of prosumers. The raw energy data are stored off-chain while the blockchain energy transactions are generated hourly using a hashing-based digital fingerprint to ensure tamper-evident registration. Peer-to-peer energy flexibility trading is implemented using smart contracts. The signals for adjusting the prosumers' energy-related behavior are determined as results of self-assessment and flexibility trading on the blockchain market. The program settlement considers the monitored energy data to financial remunerate the community flexibility providers using flexibility tokens. The results show the solution's feasibility in managing such programs by peer-to-peer trading of flexibility.},

  abstract={Blockchain (BC) technologies and cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) have the capability of reforming transport systems’ sustainability, safety, and efficiency. AI-powered solutions allow autonomous vehicles (AVs) to respond to potential hazards, navigate complex environments, make intelligent decisions, and examine real-time data. BC technologies offer secure and decentralized platforms for data management and sharing, fostering trust and cooperation among different stakeholders in the transportation system. An Autonomous Transport System (ATS) for secure vehicle and cargo matching intends to enhance and optimize transportation by using AVs and ensuring the secure transportation of goods. This mechanism combined AV technology, secure matching, and cargo tracking methods to securely and efficiently transport goods from one place to another. In this aspect, this article presents a Blockchain Assisted Vehicle and Cargo Matching using Optimal Fuzzy Restricted Boltzmann Machine (BAVCM-OFRBM) technique for Autonomous Transport System. The major aim of the BAVCM-OFRBM technique lies in the development of an automated vehicle and cargo matching approach using an optimal DL model. In addition, the BAVCM-OFRBM technique makes use of BC technology to secure transportation details such as order and shipment information. Moreover, the BAVCM-OFRBM technique exploits the FRBM model for the selection of appropriate vehicles and cargo for transportation purposes. Finally, the efficacy of the FRBM model can be improved by the use of Ingenious Crow Search Algorithm (ICSA) based hyperparameter tuning process. The simulation results of the BAVCM-OFRBM technique are tested under different aspects. The experimental outcomes emphasized the betterment of the BAVCM-OFRBM method in vehicle and cargo matching process.},

  abstract={Envisioned to be the next-generation Internet, the metaverse has been attracting enormous attention from both the academia and industry. The metaverse can be viewed as a 3D immersive virtual world, where people use Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices to access and interact with others through digital avatars. While early versions of the metaverse exist in several Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, the full-flesh metaverse is expected to be more complex and enabled by various advanced technologies. Blockchain is one of the crucial technologies that could revolutionize the metaverse to become a decentralized and democratic virtual society with its own economic and governance system. Realizing the importance of blockchain for the metaverse, our goal in this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey that clarifies the role of blockchain in the metaverse including in-depth analysis of digital asset management. To this end, we discuss how blockchain can enable the metaverse from different perspectives, ranging from user applications to virtual services and the blockchain-enabled economic system. Furthermore, we describe how blockchain can shape the metaverse from the system perspective, including various solutions for the decentralized governance system and data management. The potential of blockchain for security and privacy aspects of the metaverse infrastructure is also figured out, while a full flow of blockchain-based digital asset management for the metaverse is investigated. Finally, we discuss a wide range of open challenges of the blockchain-empowered metaverse.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of consumer electronics devices coupled with the emergence of 6G technology has led to the establishment of an extensive network of interconnected devices, forming the underlying infrastructure of the Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, this interconnectivity introduces a myriad of security concerns, given that these devices become susceptible to malicious activities and unauthorized breaches. Moreover, conventional intrusion detection systems encounter difficulties in managing imbalanced data scenarios, wherein the count of normal instances vastly exceeds that of intrusion instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for 6G-enabled consumer electronics device intrusion detection, leveraging the power of federated meta-learning and digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment. By leveraging the distributed intelligence of meta-learning across a network of devices, our framework enables efficient and accurate detection of intrusions while mitigating the impact of imbalanced data. Furthermore, by utilizing digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment, we create a scalable and controlled setting for experimentation, enabling the development and evaluation of intrusion detection algorithms in a realistic yet controlled manner. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting intrusions on 6G-enabled consumer electronics devices. The federated meta-learning approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional intrusion detection methods, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.},

  abstract={Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online and offline selves are not different. With the technological development of deep learning-based high-precision recognition models and natural generation models, Metaverse is being strengthened with various factors, from mobile-based always-on access to connectivity with reality using virtual currency. The integration of enhanced social activities and neural-net methods requires a new definition of Metaverse suitable for the present, different from the previous Metaverse. This paper divides the concepts and essential techniques necessary for realizing the Metaverse into three components (i.e., hardware, software, and contents) and three approaches (i.e., user interaction, implementation, and application) rather than marketing or hardware approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we describe essential methods based on three components and techniques to Metaverse’s representative Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook research in the domain of films, games, and studies. Finally, we summarize the limitations and directions for implementing the immersive Metaverse as social influences, constraints, and open challenges.},

  pages={5561-5578},
  abstract={It is known that there exist mathematical problems of practical relevance which cannot be computed on a Turing machine. An important example is the calculation of the first derivative of continuously differentiable functions. This paper precisely classifies the non-computability of the first derivative, and of the maximum-norm of the first derivative in the Zheng-Weihrauch hierarchy. Based on this classification, the paper investigates whether it is possible that a Turing machine detects this non-computability of the first derivative by observing the data of the problem, and whether it is possible to detect upper bounds for the peak value of the first derivative of continuously differentiable functions. So from a practical point of view, the question is whether it is possible to implement an exit-flag functionality for observing non-computability of the first derivative. This paper even studies two different types of exit-flag functionality. A strong one, where the Turing machine always has to stop, and a weak one, where the Turing machine stops if and only if the input lies within the corresponding set of interest. It will be shown that non-computability of the first derivative is not detectable by a Turing machine for two concrete examples, namely for the problem of computing the input–output behavior of simple analog circuits and for solutions of the three-dimensional wave equation. In addition, it is shown that it is even impossible to detect an upper bound for the maximum norm of the first derivative. In particular, it is shown that all three problems are not even semidecidable. Finally, we briefly discuss implications of these results for analog and quantum computing.},

  pages={22451-22468},
  abstract={Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) twin systems will be a fundamental enabler of zero-touch network and service management (ZSM) for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Thus, a reliable XAI twin system becomes essential to discretizing the physical behavior of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and identifying the reasons behind that behavior for enabling ZSM. To address the challenges of extensible, modular, and stateless management functions in ZSM, a novel neuro-symbolic XAI twin framework is proposed that to enable trustworthy ZSM for a wireless IoE. The proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin framework consists of two learning systems: 1) implicit learner that acts as an unconscious learner in physical space and 2) explicit leaner that can exploit symbolic reasoning based on implicit learner decisions and prior evidence. The physical space of the XAI twin executes a neural-network-driven multivariate regression to capture the time-dependent wireless IoE environment while determining unconscious decisions of IoE service aggregation, such as uplink, downlink, and service provisioning. Subsequently, the virtual space of the XAI twin constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based Bayesian network that can infer a symbolic reasoning score over unconscious decisions through a first-order probabilistic language model. Furthermore, a Bayesian multiarm bandit-based learning problem is proposed for reducing the gap between the expected explained score and the current obtained score of the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin. Experimental results show that the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin can achieve around 96.26% accuracy while guaranteeing from 18% to 44% more trust score in terms of reasoning and closed-loop automation.},

  abstract={With digital information applied in intelligent transportation system, pavement crack detection with digital twins has drawn widely attention since the past several years. However, it is still a challenge task to accomplish crack detection satisfactory results due to complex pavement background. This paper presents a pavement crack detection method based on 3D edge representation and data communication with digital twins. Firstly, pavement data is achieved by multiple sensors including video data and 3D scanning technology, and the digital twins based model is constructed based on data communication. Secondly, to distinguish between crack feature and pavement background in depth level, the point cloud data enhancement method based on fractional differential is proposed to strengthen crack boundary and maintain detail simultaneously. Thirdly, a 3D crack segmentation algorithm is proposed based on edge feature representation. After improved filter function with plane proximity and depth similarity, the gradient magnitude values of every point are estimated by the neighborhood and direction. Two thresholds are computed automatically using the iteration method to extract the crack from pavement. Finally, the dataset is established by 2600 crack data, and extensive experiments verify the proposed method could conduct better result compared with other existing methods using F-measure evaluation system.},

Automation and autonomy are key enablers of next generation cloud networks. With this in mind, we present a demonstrator of ML-assisted user plane resource management and orchestration. We considered a static resource management policy and implemented an intelligent agent that manages a virtual router location with the goal to minimize the latency of mobile users in a distributed network. The demonstrator illustrates a bottom-up way forward to develop an artificial network engineer that will improve the manageability of next generation cloud networking starting from small scale within network partitions, but effectively creating a fluid wide-area connectivity for computing anywhere with 6G cloud networks. We identify key open questions that need to be answered in order for the solution to scale to the incoming 6G cloud networks.},

  abstract={Department of Defense “Maintenance of the Future” capabilities will necessarily nest under the digital transformation banner and require near-term innovative solutions. The required attributes, while essentially common across the Services, will push long-standing, traditional maintenance facilities and practices out of comfort zones. Genuine transformation to agile software/hardware delivery, digital twins, information assured/resilient network architectures, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA) represent both the challenges and opportunities to harness Maintenance for the Future transformation - easier said than done. Maintainers and facilities need tomorrow's answers, today. Fortunately, many are available and adaptable for immediate integration. For example, Air Force Material Command and the Air Force Sustainment Center have shared with industry various overviews of their image for Flightline-of-the-Future and Digital Depots concepts, outlining that the government is in the process of data gathering to shape requirements as well as understand the cutting-edge capabilities of industry. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of capabilities and solutions for what the Flightline of the Future can be and how continuity can be maintained between all maintenance levels (Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot). This paper also explores approaches for Next Generation Test Systems by highlighting current solutions and goals for the future. We focus on breaking from legacy implementations of backplanes and instrumentation as well as new capabilities for ensuring cybersecurity, streamlined processing of Authority to Operate (ATO), MOSA frameworks for interfacing to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and potential schemas for advanced data analysis supporting logistical and predictive methodologies.},

  abstract={In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, billions of sensors and devices collect and process data from the environment, transmit them to cloud centers, and receive feedback via the Internet for connectivity and perception. However, transmitting massive amounts of heterogeneous data, perceiving complex environments from these data, and then making smart decisions in a timely manner are difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, is now a proven success in various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. AI introduced into the IoT heralds the era of AI of things (AIoT). This article presents a comprehensive survey on AIoT to show how AI can empower the IoT to make it faster, smarter, greener, and safer. Specifically, we briefly present the AIoT architecture in the context of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. Then, we present progress in AI research for IoT from four perspectives: 1) perceiving; 2) learning; 3) reasoning; and 4) behaving. Next, we summarize some promising applications of AIoT that are likely to profoundly reshape our world. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing AIoT and some potential research opportunities.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their promise for substantial and long-term benefits to society, economy, environment, and citizens. In addition, the rapid advances in computing, communication, and storage technologies have resulted in a revolution in the information communication technology domain and domination in the industry context. The utilization of CPSs in industrial settings has led to industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), which, in conjunction with the information-driven interactions, enables large-scale cooperation in industrial facilities and among all the stakeholders of the value chain. Hence, the research on ICPSs is essential, especially with respect to the engineering of such systems for industrial applications. This article presents an overview of recent developments in ICPSs. We first introduce the architecture of ICPSs. Then, we review the developments of ICPSs in relevant research domains. Finally, this article concludes by presenting some potential future research directions on ICPSs.},

  abstract={Recent technological breakthroughs in vehicular ad hoc networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed vehicles into smart objects thus paving the way for the evolution of the promising paradigm of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which is an integral constituent of the modern intelligent transportation systems. Simply put, IoV attributes to the IoT-on-wheels, wherein vehicles broadcast safety-critical information among one another (and their immediate ambiences) for guaranteeing highly reliable and efficacious traffic flows. This, therefore, necessitates the need to fully secure an IoV network since a single malicious message is capable enough of jeopardizing the safety of the nearby vehicles (and their respective passengers) and vulnerable pedestrians. It is also pertinent to mention that a malicious attacker, i.e., vehicle, is not only able to send counterfeited safety-critical messages to its nearby vehicles and the traffic management authorities but could further enable a compromised vehicle to broadcast both spoofed coordinates and speed-related information. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that malicious entities and their messages be identified and subsequently eliminated from the network before they are able to manipulate the entire network for their malicious gains. This paper, therefore, delineates on the convergence of the notion of trust with the IoV primarily in terms of its underlying rationale. It further highlights the opportunities which transpire as a result of this convergence to secure an IoV network. Finally, open research challenges, together with the recommendations for addressing the same, have been discussed.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a major innovative force and a major pillar in the fourth industrial revolution. This trend has been acknowledged by the European Commission, who has pointed out how high-performance, intelligent, and secure networks are fundamental for the evolution of the multiservice Next Generation Internet (NGI). While great progress has been done in the accuracy and performance of AI-enabled platforms, their integration in autonomous decision-making and critical systems requires end-to-end quality assurance. AI@EDGE addresses these challenges harnessing the concept of “reusable, secure, and trustworthy AI for network automation”. To this end, AI@EDGE targets significant breakthroughs in two fields: (i) general-purpose frameworks for closed-loop network automation capable of supporting flexible and programmable pipelines for the creation, utilization, and adaptation of the secure, reusable, and trustworthy AI/ML models; and (ii) converged connect-compute platform for creating and managing resilient, elastic, and secure end-to-end slices supporting a diverse range of AI-enabled network applications. Cooperative perception for vehicular networks, secure, multi-stakeholder AI for Industrial Internet of Things, aerial infrastructure inspections, and in-flight entertainment are the uses cases targeted by AI@EDGE to maximise its commercial, societal, and environmental impact.},

  abstract={Blockchain systems are challenged by the so-called Trilemma tradeoff: decentralization, scalability, and security. Infrastructure and node configuration, choice of the Consensus Protocol, and complexity of the application transactions are cited among the factors that affect the tradeoff balance. Given that Blockchains are complex, dynamic systems, a dynamic approach to their management and reconfiguration at runtime is deemed necessary to reflect the changes in the state of the infrastructure and application. This paper introduces the utilization of DigitalTwins for this purpose. The novel contribution of the paper is the design of a framework and conceptual architecture of a Digital Twin that can assist in maintaining the Trilemma tradeoffs of time-critical systems. The proposed Digital Twin is illustrated via an innovative approach to the dynamic selection of Consensus Protocols. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can effectively support the dynamic adaptation and management of the Blockchain.},

  abstract={Metaverse is a multidimensional virtual world that integrates digital twin space technology. It is an interactive and integrative process with the physical world, involving virtualization and digitization of the real world. The high demands of the metaverse on transmission latency, processing speed, and security pose significant challenges to network load. In this article, we study an online distributed caching model in the context of digital twin metaverse. With unknown file popularity, we elaborate a collaborative caching system to optimize the burst bit error rate of wireless transmission while satisfying the latency requirements in metaverse applications. Then, we propose a meta-based self-supervised learning algorithm that can jointly allocate caching resources among various small base stations (i.e., metaverse edge nodes) in a distributed manner. Notably, given the system heterogeneity due to the massive number of devices in the metaverse, we cleverly introduce a multi-exits mechanism for neural networks to cope with the strong demand for ultra-low latency in metaverse applications. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by numerical simulations, which significantly improve the transmission efficiency compared with existing comparative methods, thus facilitating the development of green communication technologies. Therefore, these methods are of great relevance to the future development and application of metaverse.},

  abstract={The metaverse is at the forefront of the next-generation internet application, where billions of users seamlessly immerse themselves in a hybrid reality of physical-virtual worlds and switch between virtual environments thanks to reliable resource allocation and synchronization. However, the exponential growth of users and computationally intensive applications make joint optimization of multiple indicators challenging. Therefore, predicting user behavior is pivotal in assisting the optimization process. Although graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in traffic prediction, most existing schemes link nodes based on their distances and require significant computational resources, limiting their generalization and deployment in the metaverse. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient Spatio-temporal Identity Multi-graph convolutional network Framework (SIMF) for application-level traffic prediction in the metaverse. In the SIMF, we design a spatio-temporal embedding layer and multi-graph convolutional module to jointly capture spatio-temporal correlations among nodes (avatars) and reduce the dependence on topology information, which is more consistent with the real relationship between avatars in the metaverse. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the SIMF, which show that our proposed framework achieves superior accuracy even without graph information while maintaining low time complexity, making it suitable for traffic prediction in the metaverse.},

  abstract={Cyberattacks on Industrial Control and Automation Systems (ICAS) have significantly increased in recent years due to IT and OT convergence. Traditionally, ICAS were isolated systems running proprietary protocols on specialised software and hardware. However, to improve business processes and efficiency, ICAS vendors are adopting smart technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), Machine to Machine (M2M), Digital Twin, cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This integration presents new vulnerabilities in ICAS that can be exploited by threat actors. ICAS are utilised in critical infrastructure and widely used in power, nuclear plant, water, oil, natural gas, and manufacturing industries. Therefore, cyberattacks on these systems can pose a significant threat to humans and the environment, disrupt social services, cause financial losses, and threaten national security. Because of these threats, numerous mitigation measures are being implemented to protect ICAS from cyberattacks. However, security experience and expertise have demonstrated that we can never fully protect a system and one should never propose that their solution will fully protect. Rather one can claim that their solution/mitigation technique adds a layer to the defence in depth approach. This paper discusses the different cybersecurity standards and frameworks for ICAS, investigates the existing threats and vulnerabilities, and methods of securing ICAS},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Throughout the life cycle of any technical project, the enterprise needs to assess the risks associated with its development, commissioning, operation and decommissioning. This article defines the task of researching risks in relation to the operation of a data storage subsystem in the cloud infrastructure of a geographically distributed company and the tools that are required for this. Analysts point out that, compared to 2018, in 2019 there were 3.5 times more cases of confidential information leaks from storages on unprotected (freely accessible due to incorrect configuration) servers in cloud services. The total number of compromised personal data and payment information records increased 5.4 times compared to 2018 and amounted to more than 8.35 billion records. Moreover, the share of leaks of payment information has decreased, but the percentage of leaks of personal data has grown and accounts for almost 90% of all leaks from cloud storage. On average, each unsecured service identified resulted in 33.7 million personal data records being leaked. Leaks are mainly related to misconfiguration of services and stored resources, as well as human factors. These impacts can be minimized by improving the skills of cloud storage administrators and regularly auditing storage. Despite its seeming insecurity, the cloud is a reliable way of storing data. At the same time, leaks are still occurring. According to Kaspersky Lab, every tenth (11%) data leak from the cloud became possible due to the actions of the provider, while a third of all cyber incidents in the cloud (31% in Russia and 33% in the world) were due to gullibility company employees caught up in social engineering techniques. Minimizing the risks associated with the storage of personal data is one of the main tasks when operating a company's cloud infrastructure.},

  title={On Active Learning for Supervisor Synthesis}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={21},
  number={1},
  pages={78-90},
  abstract={Supervisory control theory provides an approach to synthesize supervisors for cyber-physical systems using a model of the uncontrolled plant and its specifications. These supervisors can help guarantee the correctness of the closed-loop controlled system. However, access to plant models is a bottleneck for many industries, as manually developing these models is an error-prone and time-consuming process. An approach to obtaining a supervisor in the absence of plant models would help industrial adoption of supervisory control techniques. This paper presents  $SupL^{*}$ , an algorithm to learn a maximally permissive controllable supervisor in the absence of plant models. It does so by actively interacting with a simulation of the plant by means of queries. If the obtained supervisor is blocking, existing synthesis techniques are employed to prune the blocking supervisor and obtain the maximally permissive controllable and non-blocking supervisor. Additionally, this paper presents an approach to interface the  $SupL^{*}$  with a PLC to learn supervisors in a virtual commissioning setting. This approach is demonstrated by learning a supervisor of the well-known Machine Buffer Machine example simulated in Xcelgo Experior and controlled using a PLC.  $SupL^{*}$  interacts with the PLC and learns a maximally permissive controllable supervisor for the simulated system. Note to Practitioners—Ensuring the correctness of automated systems is crucial. Supervisory control theory proposes techniques to help build control solutions that have certain correctness guarantees. These techniques rely on a model of the system. However, such models are typically unavailable and hard to create. Active learning is a promising technique to learn models by interacting with the system to be learned. This paper aims to integrate active learning and supervisory control such that the manual step of creating models is no longer needed, thus, allowing the use of supervisory control techniques in the absence of models. The proposed approach is implemented in a tool and demonstrated using a case study.},

  abstract={The blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT networks typically consist of many sensors and actuators. Blockchain network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart factories or for reliable drone delivery in smart cities. The distributed ledger and data block validation across blockchain networks guarantee the ultimate data security. However, the current blockchain technology is restricted in terms of its overall deployment across IoT networks. A general permissionless blockchain technology typically targets high-performance network nodes with sufficient computing power and memory space. A blockchain node with less computing power and memory, such as an IoT sensor or actuator, cannot employ blockchain technology as a fully functional node. A lightweight blockchain provides practical blockchain availability to IoT networks. We propose an operational advance to develop a lightweight blockchain for IoT networks. The opportunistic block validation optimizes the block validation process. It measures the network vulnerability based on the node reputation, block validation degree, number of fraudulent messages, and network stability. The reinforcement learning mechanism employed in the opportunistic block validation determines whether block validation is to be performed. Two separately developed reinforcement learning methods can increase the processing performance while maintaining the transaction data integrity. In addition, the proposed blockchain technology is easily implementable because it adopts a Hyperledger development environment. Directly embedding the proposed blockchain middleware platform in small computing devices proves the practicability of the proposed block validation mechanism.},

  year={2023},
  volume={9},
  number={6},
  pages={1707-1720},
  abstract={Traditional centralized machine learning uses a large amount of data for model training, which may face some privacy and security problems. On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technologies with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs’ running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a Markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed scheme, and the scheme can significantly reduce the total cost by about 50% and improve the communication performance compared with baseline schemes.},

The overwhelming importance of Finite Element Analysis, a numerical tool based on minimum potential energy for complex problems with intricate geometry, in the field of asset monitoring and analysis is portrayed using simulations. The Finite element formulation in two-dimensional fields is given primary emphasis. Reliability centered maintenance and Root Cause Failure Analysis increases the independence of the grid, but is prone to data theft and vulnerability attacks.

  abstract={Building a new-type power system with renewable energy is the key to achieving the target of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, which has been the consensus of the clean, low-carbon, and safe energy transition. The construction of a new-type power system at the industrial park level is the first demonstration of the coordinated optimization and intelligent control of power sources, grid, load, and energy storage to make overall planning to achieve diversified development. To sustain the ‘balance, security, diversity, and low cost’ construction goals of the new-type power system at the park level, the power grid dispatching and control system is transformed to the direction of intelligence and automation, which is reflected in the rapid emergence and construction of complex systems such as digital twin, simulation, reinforcement learning, model training and prediction, and intelligent decision-making of the EMS (Energy Manage System). This brings more complex data sharing, interaction, construction, and other technical requirements than ever before. At the same time, along with the simultaneous construction of new power systems such as micro-grids, virtual power plants, and distributed photovoltaic systems, it has exacerbated the problems of data divergence from business, low data utilization, and centralized architecture brought by the data lakes and data warehouses under the previous monolithic architecture, leading to the data model hard to deploy to meet the demand for efficient collection, interaction, and sharing of scattered and heterogeneous data under the new generation energy structure and greatly increases the work pressure of the data team, making the data team a bottleneck for business applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel design scheme of data processing framework with the data mesh concept, supports the federal computing and analysis engine by building a distributed metadata center, changes the previous centralized data modeling method through data service and productization, realizes data sharing and interaction between complex multi-systems by defining service invocation and encapsulation technology means, improves data utilization, and better supports the automation, rationalization, and balanced construction of the intelligent dispatch system to meet the challenges and requirements brought by the new-type park-level power system.},

  abstract={The Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) technology is one of the future drivers of distributed form of data handling especially with blockchain dominating with immutable and secured e-transactions. With its influence and pre-dominant implementation in various sectors like banking, DLT has different use-cases applied in the E-Governance too. Countries like Estonia have come up with various blockchain based e-services for more transparency and privacy. Smart contracts / chain code in the permissioned blockchain could provide the basic Smart Governance needs such as simplified beneficiary authentication, transparency, privacy, security, automation, cost control, faster processing time and so on. This shows the DLT as a catalyst for automation in the future of Smart Governance along with other technologies like IoT, digital twin and so on. This paper analyses the benefits and challenges of blockchain based E-Governance implementation as well as the different DLT types available such as DAG, hashgraph, etc. apart from the blockchain and their potential for an effective citizen centric E-Governance.},

  abstract={Smart cities have deployed a myriad of devices to sense the status of the city and its citizens in order to reconfigure different elements to improve the quality of life. However, the analysis and reconfiguration of these elements on the fly can lead to unforeseen problems. The digital twin paradigm has risen as a promising technology to analyze and test these re-configurations before their execution. These digital twins are usually centralized in the cloud. However, the emulation of highly distributed systems can lead to scalability, response time, and security and privacy problems. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical and distributed architecture for digital twins, deployed over the Cloud-to-Thing Continuum. The proposal is illustrated by means of a case study about public transportation in smart cities.},

  abstract={As an essential part of mobile networks, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are beneficial to the improvement of traffic efficiency and safety through real-time information sharing between vehicles. Digital Twins (DT) have been utilized to facilitate the design, testing, and deployment of VANETs. However, constructing Digital Twins still faces interference from malicious vehicles. Despite most vehicles following communication rules honestly, the reliability and authenticity of traffic messages cannot be guaranteed due to the network’s openness and vulnerability. Meanwhile, vehicles may suffer tracking attacks during the interaction without an effective privacy-preserving method, leading to the leakage of sensitive data. To address these issues, a decentralized trust management scheme embedded with blockchain that considers identity authentication is proposed to detect malicious DT-vehicles. In our method, each vehicle in the Digital Twin of VANETs (DT-VANETs) is equipped with a certificate recorded on the blockchain as a legal identity, which is also served as a pseudonym for security during message transmission. The trustworthiness of the vehicle is evaluated based on direct trust and recommendation trust. Direct interaction between vehicles consists of message authenticity verification and active detection, which are the basis of direct trust calculation. For other vehicles, these direct trust opinions are treated as second-hand information to obtain recommendation trust. Unreliable recommendations are filtered by our proposed RTF algorithm, further resisting cooperation attacks. Vehicles judged to be malicious will have their certificates revoked and removed from DT-VANETs, providing a guarantee for the establishment of trust in DT-VANETs. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively resist malicious attacks in DT-VANETs.},

  abstract={Motivated by climate change, increasing industrialization, and energy reliability concerns, the smart grid is set to revolutionize traditional power systems. Moreover, the exponential annual rise in number of grid-connected users and emerging key players - for example, electric vehicles - strain the limited radio resources, which stresses the need for novel and scalable resource management techniques. Digital twin is a cutting-edge virtualization technology that has shown great potential by offering solutions for inherent bottlenecks in traditional wireless networks. In this article, we set the stage for various roles digital twinning can fulfill by optimizing congested radio resources in a proactive and resilient smart grid. Digital twins can help smart grid networks through real-time monitoring, advanced precise modeling, and efficient radio resource allocation for normal operations and service restoration following unexpected events. However, reliable real-time communications, intricate abstraction abilities, interoperability with other smart grid technologies, robust computing capabilities, and resilient security schemes are some open challenges for future work on digital twins.},

  abstract={For vehicular Metaverses, one of the ultimate user-centric goals is to optimize the immersive experience and Quality of Service (QoS) for users on board. Semantic Communication (SemCom) has been introduced as a revolutionary paradigm that significantly eases communication resource pressure for vehicular Metaverse applications to achieve this goal. SemCom enables high-quality and ultra-efficient vehicular communication, even with explosively increasing data traffic among vehicles. In this article, we propose a hierarchical SemCom-enabled vehicular Metaverses framework consisting of the global Metaverse, local Metaverses, SemCom module, and resource pool. The global and local Metaverse are brand-new concepts from the Metaverse's distribution stand-point. Considering the QoS of users, this article explores the potential security vulnerabilities of the proposed framework. To that purpose, this study highlights a specific security risk to the framework's SemCom module and offers a viable defense solution to encourage community researchers to focus more on vehicular Metaverse security. Finally, we provide an overview of the open issues of secure SemCom in the vehicular Metaverses, notably pointing out potential future research directions.},

  abstract={The upsurge of Industrial Internet of Things is forcing industrial information systems to enable less hierarchical information flow. The connections between humans, devices, and their digital twins are growing in numbers, creating a need for new kind of security and trust solutions. To address these needs, industries are applying distributed ledger technologies, aka blockchains. A significant number of use cases have been studied in the sectors of logistics, energy markets, smart grid security, and food safety, with frequently reported benefits in transparency, reduced costs, and disintermediation. However, distributed ledger technologies have challenges with transaction throughput, latency, and resource requirements, which render the technology unusable in many cases, particularly with constrained Internet of Things devices.To overcome these challenges within the Industrial Internet of Things, we suggest a set of interledger approaches that enable trusted information exchange across different ledgers and constrained devices. With these approaches, the technically most suitable ledger technology can be selected for each use case while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of the most widespread ledger implementations. We present state of the art for distributed ledger technologies to support the use of interledger approaches in industrial settings.},

As a new, efficient, prospective mode, Metaverse has been studied and successfully applied in various industries. However, there is still no research about its usage in mines. In this article, we apply Metaverse to mining and propose MetaMining. We present its definition and analyze the functions it could perform. Furthermore, we propose its development phases and architecture. Specifically, MetaMining is a mode, which aims to achieve high-efficiency, high-security mining in the physical world through the interaction between the physical world and the virtual world. Its development phases involve three steps: 1) digital twins; 2) digital natives; and 3) surreality. Its architecture consists of three components: 1) human world; 2) virtual mining system; and 3) physical mining system.

  abstract={The heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) is data. IoT services processes data from sensors that interface their physical surroundings, and from other software such as Internet weather databases. They produce data to control physical environments via actuators, and offer data to other services. More recently, service-centric designs for managing the IoT have been proposed. Data-centric or name-based communication architectures complement these developments very well. Especially for edge-based or site-local installations, data-centric Internet architectures can be implemented already today, as they do not require any changes at the core. We present the Virtual State Layer (VSL), a site-local data-centric architecture for the IoT. Special features of our solution are full separation of logic and data in IoT services, offering the data-centric VSL interface directly to developers, which significantly reduces the overall system complexity, explicit data modeling, a semantically-rich data item lookup, stream connections between services, and security-by-design. We evaluate our solution regarding usability, performance, scalability, resilience, energy efficiency, and security.},

  pages={140700-140730},
  abstract={Industry 5.0 follows the steps of the Industry 4.0 paradigm and seeks for revolutionizing the way industries operate. In fact, Industry 5.0 focuses on research and innovation to support industrial production sustainability and place the well-being of industrial workers at the center of the production process. Thus, Industry 5.0 relies on three pillars: it is human-centric, it encourages sustainability and it is aimed at developing resilience against disruptions. Such core aspects cannot be fully achieved without a transparent end-to-end human-centered traceability throughout the value chain. As a consequence, Auto-Identification (Auto-ID) technologies play a key role, since they are able to provide automated item recognition, positioning and tracking without human intervention or in cooperation with industrial operators. Although the most popular Auto-ID technologies provide a certain degree of security and productivity, there are still open challenges for future Industry 5.0 factories. This article analyzes and evaluates the Auto-ID landscape and delivers a holistic perspective and understanding of the most popular and the latest technologies, looking for solutions that cope with harsh, diverse and complex industrial scenarios. In addition, it describes a methodology for selecting Auto-ID technologies for Industry 5.0 factories. Such a methodology is applied to a specific use case of the shipbuilding industry that requires identifying the main components of a ship during its construction and repair. To validate the outcomes of the methodology, a practical evaluation of passive and active UHF RFID tags was performed in an Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) under construction, showing that a careful selection and evaluation of the tags enables product identification and tracking even in areas with a very high density of metallic objects. As a result, this article serves as a useful guide for industrial stakeholders, including future developers and managers that seek for deploying identification and traceability technologies in Industry 5.0 scenarios.},

  abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is pushing the integration of physical and virtual worlds. Sensor devices provide rich sensory information to context-aware services. Actuators implement in the physical world application needs. The role of software is increasing as more and more resources become virtualized and software-defined. Smart environment is an emerging concept that has the potential to address many of the humanity problems. In this context, what are the promising tools for building the smart environments of the future? This paper provides a review of platforms, middleware, and frameworks that can help in this big challenge, discussing their architectures, service life-cycling, digital twins, cloud-based operation, virtualization, security, privacy, communication model, support for AI and machine learning, among other aspects. The proposed revision innovates by employing previous work on future Internet key enablers as parameters for qualitative comparisons. The idea is to determine the degree of alignment among current initiatives for smart environments and the ones emerging from future Internet research. Among the main conclusions are: (i) heterogeneity come to stay; (ii) many contemporary proposals do not cover important aspects raised in future Internet research; (iii) publish/subscribe model is largely employed; (iv) many proposals are stuck to the limitations of current Internet model (another reason to explore the relationship among current platforms and previous future Internet research for IoT); (v) devices interoperability is a problem solved; (vi) ingredients from future Internet research, such as SDN/NFV, ICN and SCN are systematically being adopted for smart environments design. Many others are to come; (vii) AI, machine learning, and big data support are missing not only in TCP/IP-based approaches, but also in future Internet-based.},

  abstract={Metaverse and blockchain, as the latest buzzwords, have attracted great attention from industry and academia. They will inevitably promote technological innovation in the field of building information modeling (BIM) in the future. BIM organizes various building information into a whole by establishing a virtual three-dimensional model of architectural engineering using digital technology. The metaverse seamlessly integrates the real world and the virtual world, and conducts rich activities such as creation, display, and trading. Therefore, through the exploration of the metaverse, it will be possible to build an exciting digital world and transform the physical world better. Meanwhile, introducing the blockchain technology could ensure the fairness and security of resource transactions, data storage, and other activities. In this survey, we delve into the metaverse and blockchain empowerment by studying BIM components, metaverse applications in virtual world construction, and the latest research on blockchain. We also discuss how BIM technology and blockchain can be integrated with metaverse. The collaborations between academia and industry would be certainly required for further development and interdisciplinary research on the metaverse and the integration of blockchain into BIM. We hope to see our survey help researchers, engineers and educators build an open, fair and rational future BIM ecosystem.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a critically important implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting IoT devices ubiquitously in an industrial environment. Based on the interconnection of IoT devices, IIoT applications can collect and analyze sensing data, which help operators to control and manage manufacturing systems, leading to significant performance improvements and enabling automation. IIoT systems are characterized by a variety of IIoT applications, which generate different computing tasks depending on their functionalities. Some tasks are time sensitive (TS), while others are not, and more importantly, some tasks are nonpreemptive in IIoT scenarios. Thus, processing the different IIoT applications efficiently in an IIoT environment is key to achieving automation. Since computing resources are limited in IIoT, how to rapidly process TS tasks is a critical issue. Although some existing scheduling schemes can deal with the latency requirements of TS tasks, they lack consideration for nonpreemptive tasks. To address this issue, in this article we consider a typical smart warehouse system as an example and propose a generic task scheduling scheme that reserves computing resources to wait for upcoming TS tasks in such an IIoT environment. In doing so, our proposed scheme is capable of minimizing the overall waiting time for TS tasks. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we have implemented a simulation platform for a smart warehouse and conducted extensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme, which can allocate computing resources so that the processing time for the TS tasks can be reduced. Additionally, we discuss some potential research directions toward improving performance in IIoT environments with respect to resource management, machine learning, and security and privacy.},

  abstract={To overcome increasing traffic, provide various new services, further ensure safety and security, and significantly improve travel comfort, a new communication system for railways is required. Since 2019, public networks have been evolving to fifth generation (5G) communication worldwide, whereas the main railway communication system is still based on second generation (2G) communication. It is thus necessary for railways to replace the current 2G-based technology with the next generation railway dedicated communication system with improved capacity and capability, and the 5G for railways (5G-R) technology is a promising solution for further intelligent railways. This article gives a review of the current developments of next generation railway communications, followed by a discussion of the typical services that 5G-R can provide to intelligent railways. Then the main application scenarios of 5G-R are summarized, and system configurations are compared. Some key technologies of 5G-R such as network architecture, massive MIMO, millimeter-wave, multiple access scheme, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication are presented and analyzed. Finally, some challenges of 5G-R are highlighted.},

  abstract={Robotics engineering is gradually becoming an essential part of our daily life. However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.},

Therefore, the objective of this study is to describe the current state of implementation of Big Data relating IT-Infrastructure in large companies. Through three pilot case studies the realization of Industry 4.0 regarding the topics Data Exchange, Cloud Solutions, Data Analysis, Production supported by IT, IT-Security and ERP-Integration in companies is analysed. The sources of information for the case studies were interviews and desktop research. The different cases are compared to the state of the art as described in the literature. Generally, it can be detected, that all three cases are competitive in their industry sectors with regards to IT-Infrastructure. Facts as described in literature can be transferred to the cases. For instance, the horizontal integration of data exchange can be reflected in practice, where an advanced implementation level can be identified. However, there are contradictions with regard to standardized transmission standards as e.g. OPC-UA, a standard for vertical data exchange, as well. The cases can be seen as a sample for enhancing the individual implementation of Big Data processes by improving the IT-Infrastructure.},

  abstract={The purpose of this exploration of blockchain in vehicle management based on Digital Twins in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) is to further improve intelligent transportation in smart cities. In view of the complexity of pedestrians in the real road network, the Digital Twins (DTs) technology is used to map the traffic situation in the real road network to the virtual space. Furthermore, the concrete interaction of vehicle data information is stored and transmitted by using blockchain technology. Finally, the DTs model of vehicle-mounted Ad Hoc network based on blockchain is constructed, and its performance is analyzed by simulation. The results suggest that the model algorithm adopted in this work shows a lower average delay time, its data message delivery rate is basically stable at 80%, the data message leakage rate is basically stable at approximately 10%, and the communication overhead does not exceed 700 bytes. Therefore, the in-vehicle self-organizing network model constructed in this work shows high network security performance while ensuring low latency performance, enabling information to interact more efficiently. Therefore, it can provide an experimental basis for the intelligent development and safety performance improvement of the transportation field of smart cities.},

  abstract={Metaverse is an emerging virtual universe where humans can have real-time interactions and solid social links like in the physical world, and it opens up a new era of Internet and interactions. In Metaverse, an immersive and photorealistic environment promotes social activities, including education, meetings, and shopping of digital avatars based on critical technologies, including 3D rendering, extended reality, digital twins, artificial intelligence, and Blockchain. However, the limitations of computation, storage, and energy resources restrict the development of Metaverse, and a series of system issues (e.g., latency, security, and battery-life) continue to arise. As a result, how to find corresponding measurements to mitigate unsatisfactory influences becomes the focus. Mobile edge computing (MEC) as a distributed computing paradigm offloads computation-intensive tasks to the edge of the network. It brings the resources as close as possible to the end devices, addressing the shortcomings mentioned above. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive survey of the MEC-based Metaverse. Particular emphasis is given to the technologies convergence, architectures, and application scenarios, e.g., BoundlessXR and CloudXR.

  abstract={Radio access network (RAN) technologies continue to evolve, with Open RAN gaining the most recent momentum. In the O-RAN specifications, the RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) are software-defined orchestration and automation functions for the intelligent management of RAN. This article introduces principles for machine learning (ML), in particular, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in the O-RAN stack. Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art research in wireless networks and cast it onto the RAN framework and the hierarchy of the O-RAN architecture. We provide a taxonomy for the challenges faced by ML/RL models throughout the development life-cycle: from the system specification to production deployment (data acquisition, model design, testing and management, etc.). To address the challenges, we integrate a set of existing MLOps principles with unique characteristics when RL agents are considered. This paper discusses a systematic model development, testing and validation life-cycle, termed: RLOps. We discuss fundamental parts of RLOps, which include: model specification, development, production environment serving, operations monitoring and safety/security. Based on these principles, we propose the best practices for RLOps to achieve an automated and reproducible model development process. At last, a holistic data analytics platform rooted in the O-RAN deployment is designed and implemented, aiming to embrace and fulfil the aforementioned principles and best practices of RLOps.},

  year={2023},
  volume={8},
  number={4},
  pages={2832-2841},
  abstract={The traffic environment and driving behaviors are of great complexity and uncertainty in our physical world. Therefore, training in the digital world with low cost and diverse complexities become popular for autonomous driving in recent years. However, the current training methods tend to be limited to static data sets and deterministic models that do not sufficiently take into account the uncertainty and diversity prevalent in real traffic scenarios. These approaches also limit more possibilities for the comprehensive development and optimization of vision systems. In this paper, we develop a parallel training method based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) for the intelligent optimization and learning of the aforementioned agents in uncertain driving spaces. Parallel training creates a virtual driving space following the instruction of the ACP approach and conducts large-scale rehearsal experiments for possible scenarios. By enhancing the diversity of virtual scenarios, intelligent vehicles are trained to respond and adapt to the diverse uncertainties in the physical real-world driving space. Specifically, parallel training first proposes a standard operating procedure for intelligent driving systems, namely the projection-emergence-convergence-operation (PECO) loop. Digital quadruplets for parallel training, i.e., physical, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive coaches, are also proposed. With the guidance of parallel training, virtual and real-world driving spaces are set up in parallel and interact frequently. They are closely linked and unified in opposition to each other, ultimately building a parallel driving system that fulfills safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness (6S).},

  abstract={Aiming to provide a novel paradigm of oil fields, metaverses-based parallel oil fields are proposed in this article. Compared with the existing smart/intelligent oil fields in cyber–physical systems (CPS), parallel oil fields can take human factors into full consideration and expand the operation space to cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), which can be regarded as the abstract and scientific explanation of metaverses. In the proposed parallel oil fields, there are three kinds of workers (human workers, digital workers, and robotic workers) coordinating to construct a more reliable and intelligent oil field. Furthermore, the framework and methodology of parallel oil fields are illustrated by parallel systems and the artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel executions (ACP) approach. Based on the proposed framework, parallel oil fields are capable of generating a more trustworthy artificial system and guaranteeing the realization of the 6S (safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness) goal. Finally, based on dynamometer cards, fault diagnosis of sucker rod pumping systems (SRPS) is investigated in parallel oil fields.},

  abstract={As power grids modernize to include wide area monitoring and advanced metering infrastructures, the applications for data-driven methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) for situational awareness, reliability, and security continue to grow. However, obtaining effective training data that captures normal and anomalous operations in power systems remains a great challenge. This paper proposes a data-augmentation method that can efficiently build effective training data sets, benefiting various data-driven applications used in power grids without increasing the size of training data set. By leveraging load prediction in smart grids, we obtain the knowledge of future operating conditions and potential anomalies, which are integrated with the historical data in the training data set. By utilizing this augmented training data set, we significantly increase the accuracy of data-driven fault detection, e.g., 8.6% on average, compared to the results trained based on historical data only.},

  abstract={Land use and land cover information in combination with other thematic datasets related to detailed reference spatial data in localities from an important dataset for different types of analyses in different domains. At the time being, when it comes to the strategy of the SDG, Green Deal, Destination Earth, and construction of Earth’s digital twins, there is no model and database that would effectively gather information about the Earth’s surface in sufficient detail and complex relations. The situation is much worse in Africa compared to Europe since there exist only scattered map layers from public sources across all Africa like Africover and CCI Land Cover 2016. Moreover, the other close option ‘OpenStreetMap’ with a continent-wide coverage collects data on a voluntary basis with minimal attributes. For this reason, it’s prudent to provide validation and harmonisation of this data. Therefore, there was a focus on developing and optimising a new solution based on the Open Land Use (OLU) 2.0 data model. The OLU 2.0 database combined various thematic data with the most detailed reference geometry available. Thematic datasets were focused primarily on the information of land use and land cover and additionally on other themes like soil, topographic characteristics, climatic parameters, data from classification of remote sensing data, vegetation indices of field blocks, etc. and in different time periods. In this way, OLU4Africa 2.0 defined a model which can have large potential in Africa for high-end applications such as food security modelling; environment, biodiversity, and ecosystem protection; planning purposes; forest and water protection. It is worth mentioning that the OLU4Africa 2.0 application has been nominated among WSIS Prizes 2022.},

  abstract={The digitalization trend is prominent in a wide variety of sectors, and the energy sector is no exception. The incorporation of blockchain, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), in energy services has been examined in literature and quite a few endeavors of DLT adoption in energy applications have been implemented by companies, universities and other organizations. The European LIFE project “InEExS” pursues to apply DLT through specific business cases, so as to offer improved digital energy services and encourage energy efficiency. In this paper, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis has been conducted as a first stage of DLT potential usages evaluation in the contexts of the InEExS, with the purpose of demonstrating the reasons why blockchain could support the digitalization of energy applications and acceleration of energy transition, while pointing out the most important barriers that should be addressed to ensure that DLT integration would be truly beneficial. The decentralized nature of blockchain, combined with the transparency and safety it provides, make it a very promising technology for energy management and trading implementations, among others. However, technical constraints, such as the scalability problem, security threats, as well as sociopolitical and regulatory barriers should not be neglected. The findings of our SWOT analysis are combined with an assessment of prospective blockchain usages in the business cases deployed by the InEExS, so that the best practices to optimally exploit DLT in various energy applications, within and beyond the project, are identified.},

  abstract={Currently, powerful and ubiquitous mobile devices provide an opportunity to map physical conditions to cyberspace and realize Digital Twins enabled Healthcare (DTeH). Especially, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic renders it necessary to keep an eye on the changing trend of respiration. Long-term respiration monitoring helps to assess personal health status and thus becomes an important issue in DTeH. However, previous mobile device-assistant methods mostly implement the monitoring via short-time detection in a best-effort way and with less consideration of identity recognition, the only mean to bind physical vital signs into personal profiles in digital twins space. Thus, it is necessary to introduce the identification to complete string multiple short-time detections and form long-term personal monitoring. To this end, we propose IDRes, an identity-based respiration monitoring system for DTeH. This system employs mobile devices to generate a high-frequency sonar signal to complete respiration detection and identity recognition. As well as it also estimates the respiration rate by tracking the phase change of the sonar signal and recognizes identity via the Doppler frequency shift of the signal to capture characteristics of chest movement. Moreover, via band-pass filtering to remove the low-frequency voice component of the received signals, the usage of the high-frequency sonar signal also enhances security at the physical level. At last, we conduct a series of experiments under different conditions. Experimental results illustrate that IDRes achieves the mean detection error of 0.49bpm with over 93.3% recognition accuracy, and manifest that IDRes can satisfy the requirements of mapping the accurate vital sign data to the personal profile of DTeH.},

  abstract={We have been witnessing an unprecedented increase in the aging population in human history. It is nontrivial to ensure the health and safety of seniors living alone. The prohibitive human labor cost necessitates more sustainable, technology-oriented approaches instead of labor-intensive solutions. The raising digital healthcare services (DHS) leveraging the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Digital Twins (DT), and advanced fifth-generation and beyond (B5G) wireless communication technology, are widely recognized as promising solutions. By enabling a seamless interwoven of the physical world and cyberspace, Metaverse makes an ideal home for the next generation of DHS. Thanks to characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and unalterability, Blockchain is envisioned to enhance security properties in Metaverse. This paper proposes MetaSafe, a DHS architecture for seniors’ safety monitoring in Metaverse. Based on monitoring data collected by sensors, the activities and status of seniors, who are considered as the physical objects (PO), are mirrored to corresponding logical objects (LO) in a virtual community in the Metaverse, where activity recognition, potential risk prediction, and alert generation are realized. By leveraging Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technology to tokenize identities (POs and LOs) and data streams of the DHS on the blockchain, an NFT-based authentication fabric allows for verifiable ownership and traceable transferability during the data-sharing process. Specifically, an instant alerting system is introduced in this work that leverages a hybrid algorithm combining the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach with the long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Through an extensive experimental study, MetaSafe is validated as a feasible and promising approach to protect seniors living alone.},

  abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) is increasingly considered for use in real industrial applications [8]. In our industrial research lab at Siemens Technology, we are continuously discussing suitable AR scenarios in business sectors involving power plants, wind turbine plants, and oil and gas factories. We have developed a company-internal AR system architecture, Hololayer, which provides AR facilities in a reusable manner to development engineers such that they can build their own AR applications for their specialized use cases. The integration of AR technology into industrial processes encounters many complex issues: we need to adhere to many safety, security and quality guarantees while also adapting quickly to the rapidly changing state of the art of AR devices (HMDs, tablets). To increase flexibility, it might be good to integrate Hololayer with one of the open frameworks that have recently been proposed [11], [29], [38]. Yet, care must be taken when converting an already existing, large company-owned framework like Hololayer to such platforms. Some of the proposed standardized APIs and communication protocols may be difficult to abide by, without requiring significant rewriting efforts or even violating company-internal regulations. In this paper, we report on our efforts to combine Hololayer with one such platform, Ubi-Interact [38]. This is a collaboration between Siemens technology and the FAR group at TU Munich. After exemplary descriptions of typical application scenarios, we present the underlying principles of Hololayer to support this range of applications. We then describe rudimentary concepts of Ubi-Interact, followed by an elaboration on the efforts to combine both systems for a selected application scenario and a discussion of the results achieved thus far.},

  abstract={Recently, the industry has been driven to move industrial control systems to the cloud due to the significant advantages it offers in terms of storage and computing resources. However, this shift also brings forth significant security challenges. By moving control systems to the cloud, the potential for attackers to infiltrate the system and launch damaging attacks increases. These attacks can result in severe disruptions and potentially catastrophic consequences. Hence, attack detection and mitigation mechanisms are crucial for cloud control systems. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages the digital twins concept and virtual actuator method to detect and mitigate deception attacks on control signals within cloud control systems. By conducting experiments on a real testbed and subjecting it to a set of attacks, we validate the effectiveness of our solution. Our proposed method successfully detects attacks in a timely manner and keeps the plant stable, with a good performance during the attack.},

  abstract={Sea-based rescue organizations play a vital role in maritime civil security by resolving offshore emergencies, securing sea routes, and monitoring critical naval infrastructure. However, increasing marine traffic makes rescue operations more difficult, demanding better organization and orchestration of available resources. Therefore, ensuring efficient maintenance, availability and timely deployment of rescue cruisers is of great importance, particularly in rough sea conditions. To achieve this, we design an AI-based system for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring that enables real-time analyses of the ship’s sensory data and the detection of anomalies in the system behavior. In this paper, we detail our software and hardware architecture for these purposes, and we discuss the respective requirements regarding onboard and off-ship data analysis from various data sources (sensor data, camera data, weather data). We underpin our approach by emulating data flows derived from sensory data. Finally, we provide the first results in AI-based anomaly detection, allowing, for instance, early engine malfunctions identification before the actual failure occurs.},

  abstract={Uncertain, unpredictable, real-time, and lifelong evolution causes operational failures in intelligent software systems, leading to significant damages, safety and security hazards, and tragedies. To fully unleash such systems' potential and facilitate their wider adoption, ensuring the trustworthiness of their decision-making under uncertainty is the prime challenge. To overcome this challenge, an intelligent software system and its operating environment should be continuously monitored, tested, and refined during its lifetime operation. Existing technologies, such as digital twins, can enable continuous synchronisation with such systems to reflect their most up-to-date states. Such representations are often in the form of prior-knowledge-based and machine-learning models, together called ‘model universe’. In this paper, we present our vision of combining techniques from software engineering, evolutionary computation, and machine learning to support the model universe evolution.},

  pages={448-469},
  abstract={The automotive industry aims to deploy commercial level-5 fully autonomous self-driving vehicles (FA-SDVs) in a diverse range of benefit-driven concepts on city roads in the years to come. In all future visions of operating networks of FA-SDVs, humans are expected to intervene with some kind of remote supervisory role. Recent advances in cyber-physical systems (CPS) within the concept of Internet of Everything (IoE) using tactile Internet (TI) teleport us to teleoperate remote objects within the cyber-world. Human-on-the-loop (HOTL) haptic teleoperation with an extension of human control and sensing capability by coupling with artificial sensors and actuators with an increased sense of real-time driving in the remote vehicle can help overcome the challenging tasks when the new driver — artificial intelligence (AI) agent — encounters an unorthodox situation that can’t be addressed by the autonomous capabilities. This paper analyses HOTL real-time haptic delay-sensitive teleoperation with FA-SDVs, in the aspects of human-vehicle teamwork by establishing two similar remote parallel worlds — real-world vehicle time-varying environment and cyber-world emulation of this environment, i.e., digital twins (DTs) — in which a human telesupervisor (HTS), as a biological agent, can be immersed with no cybersickness enabling omnipresence through a timely bidirectional flow of energy and information. The experiments conducted as a proof of concept of HOTL haptic teleoperation regarding learning with human-vehicle collaboration show promising results and the potential of benefiting from the proposed framework.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={61144-61160},
  abstract={Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA’s) have been employed by botnet orchestrators for controlling infected hosts (bots), while evading detection by performing multiple DNS requests, mostly for non-existing domain names. With blacklists ineffective, modern DGA filtering methods rely on Machine Learning (ML). Emerging needs for higher intrusion detection accuracy lead to complex, non-interpretable black-box classifiers, thus requiring eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. In this paper, we utilize SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to derive model-agnostic, post-hoc interpretations on DGA name classifiers. This method is applied to binary supervised tree-based classifiers (e.g. eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost) and deep neural networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to assess domain name feature importance. SHAP visualization tools (summary, dependence, force plots) are used to rank features, investigate their effect on model decisions and determine their interactions. Specific interpretations are detailed for identifying names belonging to common DGA families pertaining to arithmetic, wordlist, hash and permutation based schemes. Learning and interpretations are based on up-to-date datasets, such as Tranco for benign and DGArchive for malicious names. Domain name features are extracted from dataset instances, thus limiting time-consuming and privacy-invasive database operations on historical data. Our experimental results demonstrate that SHAP enables explanations of XGBoost (the most accurate tree-based model) and MLP classifiers and indicates the characteristics of specific DGA schemes, commonly employed in attacks. In conclusion, we envision that XAI methods will expedite ML deployment in networking environments where justifications for black-box models are required.},

  abstract={Rapid processing of abandoned objects is one of the most important tasks in road maintenance. Abandoned object detection heavily relies on traditional object detection approaches at a fixed location. However, detection accuracy and range are still far from satisfactory. This study proposes an abandoned object detection approach based on vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and edge artificial intelligence (AI) in road scenes. We propose a vehicular detection architecture for abandoned objects to achieve task-based AI technology for large-scale road maintenance in mobile computing circumstances. To improve detection accuracy and reduce repeated detection rates in mobile computing, we propose a detection algorithm that combines a deep learning network and a deduplication module for high-frequency detection. Finally, we propose a location estimation approach for abandoned objects based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system and an affine projection model to accurately compute the positions of abandoned objects. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 99.57% and 53.11% on the two datasets, respectively. Additionally, our whole system achieves real-time detection and high-precision localization performance on real roads.},

  abstract={Metaverse is a collective term for all economic and social activities in the space where the physical world, digital world, and consciousness world are interactively integrated and mutually empowered. The metaverse is the advanced stage of digital civilization and the future formation of human society. The basis for developing metaverse is general digital technologies such as high-performance network, high-performance storage, high-performance computing, high-performance security, and artificial intelligence. On the basis of the above, the key to developing the metaverse lies in researching core technologies such as digital life technologies, trusted collaborative network technologies, natural interaction technologies, ubiquitous operating system technologies, technologies and methods for computational experiments, and theories and technologies for crowd intelligence science. We should take typical metaverse application scenarios as entry points, such as the key fields of agriculture, industry, service industry, military, social governance, and other economic and social areas, to break through key metaverse technologies and implement pilot demonstration projects of metaverse. Through the demonstration, we can systematically promote the application of metaverse in economy and society from point to line, and continuously iterate and evolve the metaverse technology to advance the metaverse to a higher stage. This paper systematically analyzes the current development status and future directions of metaverse from the concept, key technology, and vision of metaverse, paving the way for the subsequent research of metaverse.},

  abstract={The recent development of cloud computing and edge computing shows great promise for the Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV), by enabling CAVs to offload their massive on-board data and heavy computing tasks. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, different entities in the intelligent transportation system (e.g., vehicles, infrastructure, traffic management centers, etc.) get connected with each other, thus making the entire system smarter, faster, and more efficient. However, these advances also bring significant challenges to public authorities, industry, as well as scientific communities. In terms of system design and control, current cloud and edge architecture of CAVs need to be refined or even redesigned to better function under uncertainties in demand, and to better cooperate with existing conventional vehicles and infrastructure. From the performance assessment perspective, models and simulation tools based on artificial intelligence and big data have been widely developed for validation and evaluation of cloud computing and edge computing, but the validity of these models needs to be re-examined with field implementations. Finally, while the increasing connectivity among vehicles and infrastructures may help improve their perception of the environment and enable coordinated decision making, it also presents new challenges to ensure system safety and security, with inherent disturbances to wireless communication networks and also the inevitably larger attack surface that may be exploited by malicious attacks. In this tutorial, experts from academia and industry introduce the trends and challenges of applying cloud and edge computing for CAVs, highlight representative works in the literature and discuss their limitations, present new promising solutions, and outline future directions in research and engineering. Particular focus will be given to methodologies and tools for building digital twin frameworks with cloud and edge computing for CAVs, quantitative and formal analysis for ensuring CAV safety under disturbances and uncertainties, system-level CAV security threat landscape and defense solution space, and experiences from practical deployment of cloud and edge computing for CAVs.},

The proposed method optimizes resource utilization, lowers energy consumption, and adapts to changing conditions by using cutting-edge algorithms and machine-learning techniques.

  abstract={Recent research has demonstrated that the heat induced by high data rate transmission could cause low-temperature burns. As a promising application for future wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is capable of providing high data rate transmission for ground users. Inspired by this progress, this article focuses on the resource allocation for the UAV scenario and proposes a novel framework to consider the newly mentioned phenomenon named by power-consumption outage (PCO). Specifically, we give the analysis of heat transfer model in the smartphone based on which we initially integrate the influence of PCO into the optimization problem of the UAV scenario. Furthermore, to solve the problem with joint optimization of bandwidth allocation and trajectory design, we propose a machine learning model consisting of the position prediction based on echo state network and the joint optimization based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Due to the continuity in action space, DRL optimization is specifically implemented by the normalized advantage function algorithm. Besides, considering the restriction for the implementation of machine learning, we propose a digital twin-enabled architecture to provide a virtual environment for the training. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed scheme in total throughput and the adaptability for trajectory design in the presence of PCO.},

First, a dynamic model of the current-controlled VSCs system based periodic forced oscillations is established to describe the relationships between system parameters and intrinsic quantities. Then, the multi-scale method is introduced to derive the mathematical expressions of approximate analytical solutions and relationship equation. Next, these characteristics, containing jumping phenomenon, frequency shift, doubling frequency response, and frequency coupling, are found and described by analyzing the mathematical expressions.

  abstract={Integrating a high share of electricity from intermittent and non-dispatchable Inverter Based Resources (IBRs) predominantly from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are essential for meeting the future energy needs while decarbonising the power sector. However, short circuit responses and dynamic characteristics of IBRs connected to transmission grid are decided by the converter control strategy under different operating conditions which are fundamentally different from traditional synchronous generators (SGs). Consequently, the performances of commercially available protection relays used for transmission lines protection are challenged. Therefore, there is an extreme need for in-depth and groundbreaking studies to develop new or modified techniques on design and testing of protection relays to ensure effectiveness, reliability, and security of operation of the protection system used for transmission network. In this paper, the results of the literature review on the impact of IBRs on the performances of transmission line protections are presented and the emerging technologies that target these challenges to provide the required flexibility, adaptability, and dynamic capability of future protection relays under different operating conditions and regulatory requirements are introduced. In addition, the importance of setting regulatory frameworks and standardization of relay testing strategies using modern validation tools such as Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL), Software-in-the-loop (SiL) real time testing and digital twin environment is highlighted.},

  abstract={Change detection and irregular object extraction in 3D point clouds is a challenging task that is of high importance not only for autonomous navigation but also for updating existing digital twin models of various industrial environments. This article proposes an innovative approach for change detection in 3D point clouds using deep learned place recognition descriptors and irregular object extraction based on voxel-to-point comparison. The proposed method first aligns the bi-temporal point clouds using a map-merging algorithm in order to establish a common coordinate frame. Then, it utilizes deep learning techniques to extract robust and discriminative features from the 3D point cloud scans, which are used to detect changes between consecutive point cloud frames and therefore find the changed areas. Finally, the altered areas are sampled and compared between the two time instances to extract any obstructions that caused the area to change. The proposed method was successfully evaluated in real-world field experiments, where it was able to detect different types of changes in 3D point clouds, such as object or muck-pile addition and displacement, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. The results of this study demonstrate important implications for various applications, including safety and security monitoring in construction sites, mapping and exploration and suggests potential future research directions in this field.},

  pages={iii-vi},
  abstract={With the growing maturity of the advanced edge-cloud collaboration and integrated sensing-communication-computing systems, edge intelligence has been envisioned as one of the enabling technologies for ubiquitous and latency-sensitive machine learning based services in future wireless systems. However, with the ever-growing scale of the edge-cloud systems as well as the rapid advances in future 6G technologies, there exists a critical issue that limits the deep penetration of future 6G enabled edge intelligence services, i.e., how to accurately evaluate the performance when leveraging the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms into the existing systems. The recent advanced Digital Twin (DT) has been envisioned to provide a fault-tolerant and low-cost platform for accurately simulating and evaluating the emerging technologies, protocols, and algorithms, without causing any negative influence on the existing systems. The essence of DT aims at enabling a systematic and fully digitalized modeling systems that can produce accurate digital model of the corresponding physical identity in the DT-space. By simulating the digital models in the DT-space, DT can accurately and reliably predict and estimate the dynamics and evolutions of the physical networks during the entire life cycle, thus providing a timely and risk-free methodology for evaluating the performance when adopting the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms for network management. Therefore, DT has been considered as an efficient scheme for addressing the challenging issue to 6G enabled edge intelligence, and thus has attracted lots of interests from both academia and industries. It is observed that DT and edge intelligence can benefit each other, which thus yields a deep convergence of themselves. On the one hand, the increasing network scale, complexity, and security risks of edge intelligence raise more challenges to the security and reliability. DT can accurately simulate and predict the performance of edge intelligence services and thus provide accurate benchmark references for edge services. On the other hand, to enable accurate mapping and real-time synchronization between the physical identifies and their digital models, DT necessitates massive sensing of the targeted physical identifies as well as the consequent data analytics and modeling. Moreover, efficient yet low-latency transmissions of the sensing data and the data analytics (e.g., the inference models) are required. 6G edge intelligence can naturally provide a solution to these requirements. Therefore, this special issue focuses on the convergence of DT and 6G enabled Edge Intelligence, from the perspectives of theories, algorithms, and applications.},

  abstract={Internet of Everything (IoE) brings unprecedented challenges regarding scability, mobility, availability, and security to wireless communications. Cybertwin emerges as a promising paradigm for the next-generation mobile network, i.e., 6G. Basically, it serves as the communication anchor of a user at the edge and performs fundamental authentication and network resources control functionalities. Cybertwin is also an indispensable enabler of the cloud native network paradigm and can efficiently support the digital twin and metaverse. With cybertwin, heterogeneous access networks can be easily exploited in a synergic manner, such that advanced applications, such as multiscreen multistream rich media delivery, can be realized with guaranteed QoS. Furthermore, a user’s activities in cyberspace can be recorded naturally which becomes his/her/its digital asset. In the future, cybertwin may become the personal assistant and even an immortal second life of the user.},

  abstract={6G communication networks are expected to become an integral part of the infrastructure needed for developing a smart society in the future. Addressing the challenges on the road towards realizing 6G network requirements in terms of quality of service, user experience, and security, is therefore of utmost importance. The digital twin (DT) technology can potentially improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of 6G networks. Digital twins for mobile networks (DTMNs) are seen as a key factor in harnessing the full benefits of 6G. Using digital twins can help address several problems, including network optimization, fault diagnosis, and fault management. Furthermore, DTMNs can characterize the physical entities in a 6G network and their relationships to each other, build their virtual models, and use simulation, learning, and reasoning capabilities to make predictions and support informed decision-making,},
