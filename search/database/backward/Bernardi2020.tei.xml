<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Complex systems have presented mostly the need to be analysed with holistic approaches rather than with reductionist methods. These last years have brought one of the more powerful and promising revolutions, that is the advent of data-driven techniques. They tackle the complexity of phenomena and elicit hidden dynamics that traditional top-down methods are not capable to do: machine learning, deep learning, data mining are just some of the most popular research trends and they can be collected in the wider context of the Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>Furthermore, when modern societies started to rely on computer-based systems for key services, the infrastructures and the systems that offer such services started to become critical. The design and quality assurance of critical (complex) infrastructures and systems are two challenging tasks for engineers. Academy and industry are devoting a growing interest in the topic of moving AI techniques to the design and the quality assurance of critical systems. Nowadays, some applications are present in different domains: from self-driving cars to automated trading systems and medical diagnoses.</p><p>Researchers and practitioners have also started to query about the limit of AI and how to control and assess such algorithms: among all the main features such AI applications should have (e.g., resilience, data agnosticism, learning over time, real-time, etc.), one that is subject of growing scientific debate, is the need for AI techniques that ''explain'' their reasoning processes in order to be inspected and assessed (eXplainable AI -xAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The integration between model-based knowledge and datadriven approaches, and the knowledge extraction from results of the application driven methods are clearly two key factors to make xAI a reality (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). The advantages of such integration are numerous:</p><p>• to scale up the complexity of data analysis allowing to reduce dimensionality in real-world problems;</p><p>• to boost human activities in the supervision of complex system operations;</p><p>• to improve the trustworthiness of the system models built manually;</p><p>• to enhance the accuracy of the results predicted with the analysis. Inaccurate results may lead to invalid engineering and business decisions that have serious consequences in the critical domain;</p><p>• to support the creation of model@runtime that is to align models with data logged by the system in operation; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.03.035 0167-739X/© 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><p>• to enable automatic validation of models extracted by data mining. This special issue of Future Generation of Computer Systems focuses on model-driven approaches able to combine models and data according to different paradigms and techniques (e.g., data annotation, model learning, feature engineering). Such combination may be oriented to the assessment/supervision of functional properties (e.g., correctness, absence of mis-behaviours) or quality of service (e.g., performance, dependability, and security). In particular, this special issue takes a picture of some novel approaches and techniques answering the needs here expressed: they mainly present results in the extraction of knowledge from data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Motivation</head><p>Nowadays, the pervasive diffusion of energy-efficient and less expensive smart devices have increased the availability of operational and process data in different and very heterogeneous domains. These data are usually identified as Big Data, because of their high volume and acquisition rate, and their unstructured format. System and infrastructure interconnections, functional dependencies between components and dynamics interactions are in many cases impossible to model a-priori due to their complexity, and here it is where engineering shows its weaknesses. The knowledge discovery process on the collected Big Data can detect patterns, highlight flaws and criticalities and, in some cases, predict with high precision possible problems, reducing the propagation of failures and increasing the overall availability and dependability of the systems.</p><p>The scientific and industrial literature offers different examples showing the importance of the knowledge discovery process within the system lifecycle. As Big Data can hide relevant knowledge, it is important to consider Big Data analytics yet at the requirement elicitation stage. As discussed by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, considering Big Data analytics during requirement elicitation can reduce requirements refinement process and it helps in following a more user-centric system development. The same topic has been addressed by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, who have dealt with the synchronization of heterogeneous, unstructured and unmaintained data sources. In particular, they propose an approach for the datadriven definition of a business ontology, based on the exploitation of the available data, that is easy to be understood by human intelligence and that can be used by the management to develop a smart manufacturing process. Badii et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have defined an approach exploiting the knowledge discovery process to propose innovative services for citizens based on the data profiling their interactions.</p><p>The knowledge elicitation process can also positively contribute to a more sustainable environmental policy. Pérez-Chacón et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have defined and discussed an approach to discover power consumption in electrical networks by combining available data and machine learning with the aim of distributing the power demand and reducing the waste of energy. Marinakis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> define a high-level architecture to gather cross-domain Big Data and exploit embedded knowledge to develop a web-based decision support system for energy managers, which allow them to define an efficient energy plan to reduce CO2 emissions and the waste of energy. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> define a data-driven approach that leverages classical machine learning algorithms to address cybersecurity issues in Industrial Control Systems. These few examples demonstrate that the increasing synergies between data-driven approaches, model-based engineering and machine learning have become the key tools to develop the future cutting-edge systems and infrastructures.</p><p>There is also an increasing interest on the topic expressed by several European project calls. The Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018-2020 on Information and Communication Technologies dedicates close to 400Me to AI and related techniques in different critical domains, from smart hospitals to automated driving. Among the latest calls, the call Towards a vibrant European network of AI excellence centers 3 aims at ensuring European strategic autonomy in AI (considered as a critical technology), reinforcing and building on Europe's assets in AI. Explainable AI is clearly considered as an approach for trusted AI solutions and it is also one of the five interconnected AI scientific areas of the An European AI On Demand Platform and Ecosystem (AI4EU) platform. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> This platform will be the main outcome of an ongoing European H2020 project, where 80 partners from 21 countries are involved, and it will act as a world reference innovation tool for stimulating scientific discovery and technological innovation.</p><p>Among the past projects, it is worth mentioning Platform for Open Development of Systems of Artificial Intelligence (Bonseyes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> that aimed at developing a collaborative environment that integrates a Data Marketplace, a Deep Learning Toolbox, and Developer Reference Platforms for entrepreneurs, researchers and investors who want to adopt AI in their critical applications. The main objective of this environment is to transform current solutions, requiring high level of expertise, time and cost, to embedded products in the domain of low power IoT devices, embedded computing and data centre servers. In addition, the project SAGE 6 offered a next-generation intelligent data storage system, and provided roadmaps of technologies supporting data access. The main goal was to enable sophisticated data processing techniques within a storage system infrastructure. At last, the project Data Learning on Manifolds and Future Challenges (DEDALE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> was an interdisciplinary project that adopted novel data analysis methods, based on machine learning, to increase the precision of data extraction in critical astrophysics applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Summary of the contributions</head><p>The papers of this special issue consider different domains of computer-based critical systems -aerospace, air-traffic control, knowledge-based information systems, cloud-based application and IoT -and deal with different kinds of non-functional properties to be assessed or monitored -safety, security, performance, resilience and adaptability. Three of them propose novel approaches for extracting knowledge from data, one paper deals with data uncertainty in modelling and analysis, and one paper presents a timely survey on smart troubleshooting. In the following, we summarize the work presented in each paper.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> considers non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques that are used to test the structural health of aerospace systems and addresses the problem of the subjective interpretation of the testing results. In particular, the authors propose a classifier, based on genetic programming, to model the defects of aerospace structures detected by NDT with the aim of providing a human-independent interpretation of the testing results. The effectiveness of the classifier has been validated considering a specific technique, namely Eddy Current Testing (EDT), and a publicly available EDT dataset, which contains the results from EDT performed on aircraft structures.</p><p>3 https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/ opportunities/topic-details/ict-48-2020.</p><p>4 https://www.ai4eu.eu.</p><p>5 https://www.bonseyes.com.</p><p>6 http://www.sagestorage.eu.</p><p>7 http://dedale.cosmostat.org.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> addresses the problem of knowledge extraction from large datasets of textual and heterogeneous application logs for security situational awareness, and it proposes a novel method to filter and prioritize the events in the logs. The method relies upon the logarithmic entropy to compute a numeric score for each event in the logs, considering the context (i.e,. frequency of the event occurrence) and the behavioural baseline of the system under normative operations. The scores are then used to decide whether to retain or discard an event and to prioritize the retained events for forensic analysis purposes. The effectiveness of the method in retaining those events that occur when an attack is launched has been demonstrated on an Air-Traffic Control Information System case study.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> addresses the issue of evaluating the performance of employees in a knowledge-based organization and proposes a business intelligence framework, based on the use of Big Data analytics, to solve it. The performance of an employee is quantified by an original algorithm that considers his/her seniority and professional development. The algorithm also identifies internal factors that may cause an employee to leave the workplace. The authors have developed a prototype and the approach has been validated with real and anonymized data from a multinational company.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> addresses the problem of dealing with epistemic uncertainty in performance modelling and analysis of complex critical systems, such as cloud-based applications, and proposes new closed-form analytical models that allow studying the propagation of the epistemic uncertainty input parameters (i.e., arrival and service rates) of a queueing model to output parameters (i.e., number of entities and average response time). The epistemic uncertainty of input parameters captures the lack of knowledge about their values, only lower and upper bounds can be established. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, the authors consider a cloud-based application that is continuously re-deployed on different platforms.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> surveys frameworks, methodologies and tools that provide support for smart troubleshooting of cyber-physical systems, with emphasis on Internet of Things (IoT). The authors define the concept of smart troubleshooting as a ''semi-automatic process for identifying failures, matching the relevant information, applying the appropriate recovery procedures'' with the goal of enhancing the self-healing capabilities of IoT systems and, thus, their resilience. In the paper, a total of 107 publications have been surveyed and categorized according to a two-dimensions taxonomy (i.e., the phases of the smart troubleshooting and the Five W's questions). Several open issues are finally highlighted, among them: the heterogeneity of logs generated by the different system components that complicate log analysis, and the current limited availability of digital twins, which play a crucial role in the development of smart troubleshooting solutions.</p></div>
