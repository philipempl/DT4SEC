<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As digital twin (DT) is considered as an efficient way to realize the fusion between physical and virtual spaces, both academic researchers and industrial practitioners have applied it in various fields. This chapter summarizes the existing applications of the DT from two perspectives. First, scientific literature about DT applications in different stages of a product's lifecycle is collected and investigated. Second, industrial applications/potential applications of the DT are explored, which are grouped into 11 domains: aerospace, electric power generation, automotive, oil and gas, healthcare and medicine, maritime/shipping, etc. Some of the important exemplary applications are discussed to offer deeper understanding of the DT in industry. As the DT holds great promise to promote the industry development, the future market for the DT is predicted and challenges for DT applications are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">DIGITAL TWIN IN PRODUCT LIFECYCLE</head><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.1, the entire product lifecycle can be divided into three stages: design stage, production stage, and service stage. Each stage can be subdivided into more detailed phases. Accordingly, to explore the academic research of the digital twin (DT) in product lifecycle thoroughly, the related works can be classified into the following categories: (1) DT in design stage, (2) DT in production stage, (3) DT in service stage, and (4) DT across multiple stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. Functions and advantages of the DT in each category are explored separately. Based on analysis and statistics of the existing research and published papers, two conclusions are obtained: first, production and prognostics and health management (PHM) are the most popular fields for application of the DT; and second, the DT has attracted the greatest attention in the United States, China, and Europe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Digital Twin in Design Stage</head><p>As the design stage can determine the overall structures and specifications of a product or a system and thereby determine the subsequent stages, it has an important meaning in the entire product lifecycle. A good design not only can show advantages in planning, but also has good manufacturability. To improve the traditional design method, current research introduces the DT in the design stage. Some related works are reviewed in this section.</p><p>Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> believed the emergence of the DT would change the entire current product design paradigm, including conceptual design, detailed design, and virtual verification. At present, there exist some weaknesses in big data-driven product design processes, cloud manufacturing-based processes, and some other design processes. The DT is expected to overcome these weaknesses, because it can reflect asdesigned and as-built products at the same time and eliminate their differences.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed a DT-driven methodology for rapid individualized design of an automated flow-shop manufacturing system, which applies physics-based system modeling and distributed semiphysical simulation to generate a digital design of the system at preproduction stage. The authors also proposed an iterative design framework based on the DT for the iterative optimization between static design and dynamic execution, and explored key enabling technologies for the framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Based on this work, how the production would perform in the real world could be simulated in advance and optimization guides for the design could be provided.</p><p>Ferguson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> demonstrated how the US-based Mechanical Solutions, Inc. (MSI) used a simulation package from Siemens Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) Software (i.e., STAR-CCM 1 software) to build DT models for water pumps and to address design challenges. Via this software's powerful simulation capabilities, designers could easily and efficiently predict the performance of the pumps and avoid damaging effects.</p><p>Stark et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> introduced a new architecture based on the DT for modularized design of cyberÀphysical production systems (CPPS). Through integrating existing production resources in a construction kit, an evaluation method for new manufacturing processes was developed to help identify needs for new machines and cyberÀphysical system (CPS) units. Furthermore, with a virtual prototype, the architecture of the CPPS was validated and optimized.</p><p>Damiani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> applied DT-based simulation to design a real plant that produces anchoring plates for electric motor brake discs. AnyLogic software, which describes layouts, products, operators, machines, and packaging workings, was used to construct the plant and to simulate the operation process. It aims at achieving the lowest level of work in process (WIP), thus reducing the cost of storing.</p><p>Mavris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> explored a design method for an aircraft based on the DT and digital thread, which could efficiently deal with challenges in traditional design methods, including lacking physical data, uncertainty, integrating of multiple disciplines, and data and knowledge management.</p><p>With high-fidelity simulation provided by the DT, the design for a product or a production system can be validated to eliminate the potential failures before actual execution. What is more, as the DT can reflect asdesigned and as-built products synchronously, it can eliminate differences between the two.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Digital Twin in Production Stage</head><p>Production is a complex process, during which material, energy, and information flow exist synchronously and interact with each other. At this stage, researchers have made a lot of efforts, including increasing flexibility of production processes, reducing energy consumption, improving product quality, etc. Recently, some related research has combined the DT with production and obtained performance improvement.</p><p>Rosen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> discussed how the DT could be applied in supporting autonomous production systems. As the DT integrates all available data and knowledge seamlessly, it could combine related data to perform accurate simulation-based forecasting for the production, which allows high-level flexibility and automaticity.</p><p>Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposed the concept of digital twin shop-floor (DTS), and explored the conceptual model, interaction mechanism, characteristics, and key technologies for the DTS. Moreover, they discussed the operation mechanism and fusion method for each composition of the DTS to give more insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Based on the above work, an application on equipment energy consumption management in the DTS was presented and potential advantages were analyzed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Coronado et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> designed a framework of a shop-floor DT for production control and optimization. In the framework, raw data collection for physical assets is enabled using MTConnect, a mobile device application, and hypertext transfer protocol. Based on the collected data, the shop-floor DT in virtual space was created to serve the managers, providers, and clients, who take actions that affect the factory. The proposed framework was finally validated in a manufacturing research center, achieving good performance.</p><p>Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> proposed two DT models for an assembly line to improve its throughput. A throughput improvement DT model was designed to analyze real-time status of the line and provide optimized schemes for improving the line throughput, while a throughput prediction DT model was developed to predict the future throughput with low model simplicity and high accuracy.</p><p>Uhlemann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> explored the modeling method of the DT for a CPPS, mainly focusing on the concept. Collection and integration of multimodal data were discussed, and a concept for the realization of the CPPS by the DT was presented. Furthermore, they compared the traditional value stream mapping using manual data with the DT combining real-time data to illustrate the advantages of the DT in production <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> discussed an architecture of DT-driven smart shopfloor, which included a physical shop-floor layer, network layer, data layer, cyber layer, and application layer. Then in the architecture, a dynamic resource allocation optimization method was designed to reduce the task completion time.</p><p>Senington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> proposed a linked data approach to link raw data from machines to simulation models of the DT for the purposes of analysis and optimization of the manufacturing process. The authors believed that the proposed approach would play an important role in Industry 4.0, as it could support decentralized data storage and processing, modularity of software for smart factories, interoperability of heterogeneous data sources, and virtualization of factories.</p><p>Leng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> presented a DT-driven manufacturing cyberÀphysical system (MCPS) for parallel control of shop-floors. By establishing cyberÀphysical connection via decentralized DT models, various manufacturing resources could be formed as a dynamic autonomous system to create personalized products. The framework, key technologies, and implementation of the MCPS were discussed, respectively.</p><p>Vachálek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> optimized a physical production line based on the DT. As the DT collected real-time data from the actual production process, it could evaluate the production in real-time and satisfy the real-time requirements to simulation parameters. In addition, it has the ability to keep the actual process working as expected.</p><p>Banerjee and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> described a mechanism to extract and infer knowledge from large-scale production line data based on the DT, which enhances manufacturing process management with reasoning capabilities. As the DT integrates data from manufacturing, maintenance, operations, and operating environments, it could reflect the key behaviors of each asset, system, or process, thus providing intelligence for the mechanism.</p><p>Weyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> predicted that the DT would represent the next generation simulation, and it would play a critical role in developing CPPS. As the DT was characterized by the synchronization between physical and virtual spaces, it enables human operators to monitor the production process and to make timely adjustments. The methods about how to work with the DT were also discussed.</p><p>Parrott and Warshaw <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> discussed the DT model of a manufacturing process from an integrated and holistic aspect and described the DTenabled closed loop from physical space to virtual space and back to the physical space again. Ameri and Sabbagh <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> considered the DT as a digital factory that could represent the technological capabilities of manufacturing facilities. The authors described the creation method for the digital factory, including capability extraction, supply chain configuration, and factory digitalization, and applied it to a machine shop.</p><p>Brenner and Hummel <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> reported that the DT would lead to a new paradigm of creating a digital shop-floor. They analyzed the hardware and software requirements for implementing the DT in the European School of Business (ESB) Logistics Learning Factory to realize smooth interactions among person, machine, and product. Zhuang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> explored a DT-based smart production management and control framework for the complex product assembly shopfloor and discussed the related technologies. The proposed framework was applied to a satellite assembly shop-floor.</p><p>Knapp et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> developed a DT for the additive manufacturing process to predict cooling rate, temperature gradient, microhardness, velocity distribution, and solidification parameters. It was shown that the usage of the DT has led to more accurate predictions of cooling and melting rate than the level set method, volume of fluid, and heat conduction models on the basis of the finite element method (FEM).</p><p>From these studies, it can be seen that as the DT offers a bridge to link the physical and virtual spaces together, it can make the virtual space mirror the physical practical situations in a timely manner and control behaviors of the physical objects in real-time. Based on these findings, the DT has the abilities to optimize and elevate the production process to a higher level of effectiveness and flexibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Digital Twin in Service Stage</head><p>In the service stage, PHM is a crucial step that is used to monitor the health of a product, perform diagnosis and prognosis, and provide design rules for maintenance strategies. However, traditional works on the PHM are primarily driven by the physical product and its data, with little connection to its virtual model, which affects the efficiency of the PHM. To change this situation, some researchers have introduced the DT into this field.</p><p>Glaessgen and Stargel <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> introduced a DT-based prognosis method for future National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and U. S. Air Force vehicles, which could tightly combine historical data, fleet data, and sensor data to generate insights for fault prediction. It has the ability to improve conventional methods that are inadequate to meet the increasing needs for real-time monitoring and accurate prediction.</p><p>Tuegel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> applied the DT to predicting the remaining structural life of an aircraft considering multiphysics modeling, multiscale damage modeling, integration of structural FEM and damage models, uncertainty quantification, big database manipulation, and high-resolution structural analysis. They claimed that the DT could enable better management of the aircraft service life.</p><p>Zakrajsek and Mall <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> built a DT model to predict the touchdown wear and the probability of failure for aircraft tires. It was shown that the DT model could demonstrate certain superiorities over the traditional models in predicting the probability of failure for the varying sink rate, yaw angle, and speed.</p><p>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> built a DT model based on a dynamic Bayesian network for the diagnosis and prognosis of an aircraft wing fatigue crack growth. The method integrates physics models and various aleatory and epistemic uncertainty sources in crack growth prediction, and has produced accurate prediction results.</p><p>Gockel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> discussed challenges for implementing an ultrarealistic and cradle-to-grave DT model for an airframe to forecast its structural life. They concluded seven technology gaps that need to be addressed in the future for realizing this envisioned process.</p><p>Reifsnider and Majumdar <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> introduced a method to build highfidelity DT models for fleet management. The method was superior to the traditional methods because it no longer requires damage initiations to perform the fault diagnosis and shows a high sensitivity to fracture development.</p><p>Seshadri and Krishnamurthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> developed a damage characterization structural health management method for damage diagnostics and prognostics for aircraft structures. The method uses a genetic algorithm-based optimization procedure to predict damage location, size, and orientation and shows high efficiency and accuracy.</p><p>Kraft and Kuntzagk <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> built DT models with three layers to support deterioration and failure analysis for engines, and to predict remaining life for their critical parts. The authors validated the method in CFM56-5C, a mature commercial two-spool high bypass engine installed on the Airbus A340-300 and the experiment results presented major improvements.</p><p>Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> built twin models for manufacturing machines to integrate sensory data, record historical data, and manage hundreds of similar physical machines, to further assess machine conditions, identify the failure mode, and provide selfawareness and selfprediction through simulation.</p><p>Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> explored a DT-driven PHM method for complex equipment. A five-dimension modeling method for the DT of the equipment was constructed, and then based on the model, a three-stage workflow was developed to guide the PHM activities. The method was finally validated on a wind turbine.</p><p>Bitterwolf et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> trained and evaluated a supervised machine learning method based on the DT for the automated fault detection. The method was validated with a motor control model and could reduce costs associated with unnecessary maintenance or premature breakdowns.</p><p>Motivated by the DT concept, Cerrone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> presented the asmanufactured geometry to predict crack paths on a material test specimen. A specimen DT was modeled and simulated in a commercial finite element software package to deal with the ambiguity problem of the crack paths.</p><p>Magargle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> used a simulation-based DT combining with physics-based modeling techniques for heat monitoring and predictive maintenance for an automotive braking system. The method displayed immense superiority in collecting sensor information to train learning algorithms, which could contribute to accurate diagnosis of the controller in the system and failure detection of the tone ring, a speed sensor for wheel speed measurement.</p><p>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> proposed a system architecture of DT ecosystem, in which the DT fused multisource data, including historical information, technical data, maintenance report, manufacturing report, asset features, etc. to generate knowledge for the proactive maintenance, thus reducing costs and downtimes.</p><p>Cai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> constructed a DT virtual machine based on sensor data integration and information fusion to help engineers conduct diagnosis and prognosis through checking the DT model when a machine breaks down.</p><p>Hochhalter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> combined the DT with sensory materials to overcome shortcomings of traditional methods, which are overly dependent on the empirical data and hence could not respond to uncertainties in a timely manner. Using a nonstandard test specimen as an example, it was proven that the new approach could result in more accurate predictions of repair, inspection, and replacement.</p><p>Gabor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> developed a DT-based architecture that includes four tiers: physical necessity, machineÀenvironment interface, immediate reaction, and planned reaction, to predict the behaviors of CPS during its operation.</p><p>Yun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> proposed a novel architecture of large-scale DT platform including distributed DT cooperation framework, flexible datacentric communication middleware, and a platform-based DT application to develop a reliable advanced driver assistance system. For these works, on one hand, the DT-based simulation can provide more insights for diagnosis and prognosis. On the other hand, abundant models and simulated data can be obtained and integrated with physical data to generate more comprehensive and valuable information for health condition detection and analysis. Therefore, combined with the DT, the PHM has the potential to be improved to achieve higher efficiency and accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4">Digital Twin Across Multiple Stages</head><p>In the PLM, due to different processes and characteristics, data from different stages are always isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which hinders the efficient management of the entire lifecycle. As the DT can integrate data from the lifetime of a product seamlessly, it has been applied into the PLM by some researchers.</p><p>Tuegel <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> proposed an airframe DT concept for airframe designing and maintenance, which can reduce model uncertainty with increasing service experience. As modeling of the DT is a core step in the method, some technical challenges in developing the DT model were discussed in detail.</p><p>Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> put forward a DT-driven product design, manufacturing, and service method to support the product across its lifetime. The frameworks for the DT applications in the three stages were presented and further validated in bicycle design, drive shaft manufacturing, and power transformer service, respectively. Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> also explored potential applications of the DT in different stages across the product lifetime.</p><p>Liau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> introduced the DT into stages of the injection molding industry, including mold design, mold making, and the injection molding process. The DT helped the entire injection molding process move toward real-time process optimization, process monitoring, and prediction of quality defects through building a closed loop between physical and virtual spaces.</p><p>Söderberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> developed a DT to secure good geometrical quality in final products. The DT supported locating scheme optimization and statistical variation simulation in the design stage, inspection preparation in preproduction stage, as well as virtual trimming, joining sequence optimization, root cause analysis, etc. in the production stage. They further specified the related strategies in another paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Talkhestani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> developed an anchor point method to synchronize cross-domain mechatronic data models of mechatronic components in the DT during the lifecycle of existing production systems, which could detect changes in the production systems to reduce the occurrence of expensive errors.</p><p>Boschert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> believed that the DT could provide continuous values across the lifecycle of the physical entity and bridge the gaps between different stages. It could shorten the design period by using historical lifecycle experience in design, make accurate simulations in various conditions and analyze root causes of failures in production, and detect faults and give solutions for maintenance in service.</p><p>Grieves and Vickers <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> showed how the DT worked across the product lifecycle, including the creation, production, operation, and disposal stages. They deemed that the DT was helpful for transforming clients' thoughts, knowing systems deeply, checking accuracy of predictions, etc. Obstacles and opportunities of the DT were discussed as well.</p><p>Schleich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> proposed a comprehensive reference model based on "skin model shapes" as the DT of a physical product in design and manufacturing stages. The model abstraction, representation, and operations were presented and applied to the geometrical variations management for the product.</p><p>Gregory et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> believed that the DT has great significance for selfaware vehicles, as it could provide information on structure states and vehicle dynamics to assess vehicle states and generate both real-time and offline diagnosis and prognosis for structural health to improve maintenance efficiency.</p><p>Bohlin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> launched a study on necessary infrastructure, components, and data flows in the DT for geometry assurance for parts. A closed loop was described with the DT to explain what the parts experienced and relevant methods were also introduced.</p><p>Konstantinov et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> believed that the DT was consistent with CPS to some extent and developed a set of virtual engineering tools to support the manufacturing system lifecycle description. The authors used an electric machine assembly station as a case study to verify the efficiency of the presented tools.</p><p>Zhuang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> established an architecture for a product DT; discussed implementation methods for the DT in design, production, and service stages, respectively; presented its potential functions; and finally pointed out the future development trends.</p><p>Yu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> proposed that a product DT could continuously integrate and perfect data and knowledge from the product lifecycle, and hence realize data management, tracking, and maintaining for product configuration management and improve visualization and transparency during management.</p><p>Tao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> introduced methods of modeling and simulation, dynamic prediction, and evaluation for a complex product during its lifecycle based on the digital thread and the DT. The methods realized the dual mapping between physical and virtual spaces and implemented a closed loop of the product lifecycle.</p><p>With the DT, data generated from the product lifecycle can be recorded and integrated into a high-fidelity digital model with a unified encapsulation. Via powerful computing and analysis abilities of the DT, valuable information and knowledge can be mined continuously, forming continuous value streams to support activities in the PLM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.5">Observations</head><p>Based on the above papers, the following observations are obtained:  First, for PHM, as it was the earliest field in which the DT was applied, related works and technologies have been developed over a longer period of time and some exciting results have been obtained, which has inspired more researchers to work in the field. Besides, as NASA and the U.S. Air Force have introduced the DT into the PHM for future aircrafts, the DT is considered as one of the most promising technologies in the field, and thereby has attracted a lot of attention. However, current research on the PHM still has some limitations. For example, the application areas mainly focus on high-value equipment because of the DT's high costs. There will be broader applications as DT technology matures.</p><p>Second, for production, as the era of smart manufacturing is coming, many researchers are concentrating on how to realize smart operations in the production process. As the DT has the ability to bridge physical and virtual spaces seamlessly and maintain the two spaces consistently and synchronously, it shows a great potential in real-time process control and optimization, as well as accurate prediction. Hence, researchers focusing on production feel excited about the DT and have been making efforts to deploy it in their research. In the future, with the advancement of technologies and infrastructures in factories, the DT will be further popularized and adopted in production. The United States, China, and Europe are the world powerhouses in manufacturing. They have proposed strategies at their respective national levels, including Industrial Internet, CPS or CyberManufacturing, Made in China 2025, and Industry 4.0, to encourage and support related researchers and practitioners to explore implementation ways of smart manufacturing. As the DT appears as a pragmatic technology for seamless cyberÀphysical fusion, which is the core of future manufacturing, researchers in the United States, China, and Europe have enthusiastically placed great emphasis on DT-related studies ahead of other countries. They are currently in the leading position in DT literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">DIGITAL TWIN IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS</head><p>DT has been widely applied in industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. In Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.1, major industrial applications/potential applications of the DT in 11 domains are listed for easy review. In the following sections, some important examples in each domain are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Digital Twin in Aerospace</head><p>Aerospace is the earliest industrial domain adopting the DT, which was initially launched by NASA and the U.S. Air Force. Subsequently, many large companies, for example, Northrop Grumman, Airbus, Boeing, and General Electric Company (GE), also combined DT technology with their related businesses, including the aircraft maintenance, production, assembly, safety and security management, etc. Some examples are presented as follows.</p><p>To predict malfunctions and design maintenance strategies for an aircraft in space, NASA <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> has built a DT to mirror the actual conditions of the aircraft. Through feeding the DT with real-time data, it can optimize performance of the aircraft, predict potential faults in advance, and help engineers on Earth better understand the faults and provide efficient solutions. At present, NASA also attempts to use the DT to ensure crews' safety when the aircraft is out of order.</p><p>The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> has released a plan, that is, Spiral 1, for the development of the DT in aerospace. AFRL  has signed a $20 million commercial contract with GE and Northrop Grumman to carry out related research that integrates the most advanced technologies and aims at identifying the differences between entities and models accurately.</p><p>Northrop Grumman <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> has applied the DT to the final assembly line for the F-35 fighter to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce cost. It set up a digital thread-based infrastructure to support decision making on unsatisfactory products, and has improved multiple engineering processes. For example, based on the infrastructure, the decision-making time for processing machining defects of air inlets for F-35 was shortened by 33%, which contributed to Northrop Grumman winning the Defense Manufacturing Technology Achievement Award from the U.S. Department of Defense in 2016.</p><p>In 2011, Airbus [66À67] adopted an intelligent location solution from Ubisense (UBI) that connects entities in the A350XWB final assembly line in real-time, makes industrial processes and equipment applications transparent, and grasps distributions of equipment in the plant. Since then, UBI's solutions have continuously been introduced into the assembly lines and aircraft projects in the Airbus, involving the A330, A380, and A400M. Based on this, the Airbus has further deployed RFID on key tools, materials, and parts and finally established a DT for the assembly line that could predict bottlenecks based on models and optimize operation performance.</p><p>In terms of DT applications, aerospace is a relatively mature domain and a good amount of research has been conducted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.11">Digital Twin in Security and Emergency</head><p>Security and emergency measures, which are critical to the protection of assets, infrastructure, and private information against malicious attacks, are commonly involved in various industries. The DT can be introduced to the domain to achieve lower cost and better performance.</p><p>VIAKOO <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref> has discussed how the DT can protect the security of a company. In the traditional situation, when a company's devices or machines fail, the company has to provide a maintenance team with an access to its internal system to collect private data for failure identification. This is often a security risk. As the DT has the ability to integrate a large amount of data from the lifecycle of a physical asset and generate valuable information through computing, it can automatically inform the company of potential failures and related maintenance strategies. Therefore, the DT allows the company to keep maintenance in-house without enlisting a permanent team, and thus can avoid the potential security risk. System Applications and Products (SAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref> deems that the DT can prevent disasters through providing PHM services to equipment in harsh environments, such as subsea equipment. On one hand, the DT can replace or complement complex and costly physical inspections with more cost-efficient digital inspections. On the other hand, it can simulate the conditions of the equipment accurately to mimic what is exactly happening and what will happen, to optimize decision making.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.12">Observations</head><p>At present, the DT has been introduced to various industries. Among them, applications of the DT in aerospace are relatively mature. The reasons mainly include three aspects. 1. Aerospace employs and integrates the most advanced technologies in industry (e.g., high-fidelity modeling and simulation, lifecycle data integration and fusion, and connection and interconnection), which makes it a good candidate for the introduction of DT. 2. As DT applications in aerospace have been developed over a longer period of time than other industries, more researchers and practitioners have dedicated their efforts to the domain, leading to substantial improvements and progress. 3. Aerospace engineering is a special sector. As it is closely related to national defense, it has a high requirement for security and confidentiality, but a relatively low requirement for services. Hence, the initial three-dimension DT concept can exactly satisfy the requirements of this sector. However, for other sectors, it is a crucial step to encapsulate functions provided by the DT into standard services for easy and convenient use, as well as for a more enjoyable user experience. For the new demand, the initial DT concept shows shortcomings that could hinder its acceptance. As the DT is an emerging technology, developments on related models, technologies, tools, infrastructures, and standards are still lacking. In the future, with the continuous improvement and perfection of the DT, more mature applications can be realized in different industries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">CHALLENGES OF DIGITAL TWIN APPLICATIONS</head><p>Challenges of DT applications are summarized in the following seven aspects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Cognitive and Technical Level of People</head><p>First, as the DT is an emerging technology, most people lack a comprehensive understanding and cannot identify its values clearly, which leads to an oversight of the DT. Second, due to psychological and cultural boundaries, people may be limited by old stereotypes and prefer to stay in comfort zones with familiar ways than to be challenged by new approaches. Third, considering the differences in technical levels of operators, some of them do not have sufficient skills (e.g., modeling, simulation and data fusion) to work with the DT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">Technology and Infrastructure</head><p>To realize DT applications, many technologies will be involved, such as high-fidelity modeling and simulation, real-time data collection and fusion, flexible data architecture construction, continuous two-way interaction, etc. Some of the technologies have not yet been fully developed and related commercial products are lacking, which has put up barriers to the popularization and application of the DT. In addition, infrastructure (e.g., Internet connectivity, broadband speed, and sensor performance) also need to be improved to serve the corresponding technologies efficiently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3">Support Tools</head><p>Although many researchers and practitioners feel excited about the DT, when it comes to DT applications, they are not clear about related support tools. Although some big companies (e.g., Siemens, PTC and GE, Microsoft) have launched their respective software and hardware to support the DT applications, these tools are still fragmented and isolated, and have not been adopted widely. Hence, for users, a set of integrated and universal tools are urgently needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4">Standards and Specifications</head><p>For DT applications, there is a lack of standard specifications, which should be jointly developed by related researchers, suppliers, and users and should formally describe the standards for models, interfaces, protocols, data, etc. For example, heterogeneous data from different sources need to be involved and processed, but as a standardized format for the data is lacking, it is difficult to complete the data exchange, integration, and fusion to further feed the DT with valuable information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.5">Cost Control and Management</head><p>At present, constructing a complete DT is a costly project. On the one side, building high-fidelity models to precisely and thoroughly simulate entities or processes will be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. On the other side, realizing real-time collection and processing for a large amount of data needs the support of high-performance hardware and software. Therefore, in most situations, the DT will play an important role in the management of high-value, major products, equipment, or processes. For users, before deploying the DT, taking full consideration of the balance between costs and benefits brought by the DT is necessary but challenging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.6">Cyber Security and Intellectual Property Rights</head><p>Assets and businesses of enterprises can be digitalized and virtualized via the DT. Hence, cyber security is important to protect sensitive information and ensure the success of DT applications. Ample measures must be taken to ensure security, including improving security systems to deal with emerging threats, protecting networked systems in production and office space, and resisting malicious attacks on sensory devices. In addition, with developments of the DT, a set of innovative invention patents will be generated predictably. To establish a fair and orderly investment environment and market for the DT, protecting intellectual property rights efficiently is mandatory but challenging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.7">Insufficient Development of Digital Twin</head><p>As the DT is an emerging technology with a short history, it is still in the infant stage and has many issues, such as confusion in concepts, insufficiency in tools and technologies, and shortage of talents, which bring difficulties to the DT applications. In addition, as a new technology, the DT has uncertainties in its future development and may bring risks in multiple aspects, such as products, markets, businesses, investments, etc. The insufficient development of DT has thus far hindered its progress to some extent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">SUMMARY</head><p>This chapter reviews the DT applications from both academic and industrial perspectives. The conclusion can be drawn easily that the DT can be used in the entire product lifecycle and various industries, showing highly promising values in monitoring, control, optimization, and prediction of any operations.
