<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Trends Within Automotive Industry</head><p>Aside from the effects of IoT, the automotive sector is prone to further influences, such as electrification, assisted and autonomous driving (AD) and diversity in mobility services (as depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Despite apparent convergence of the push from technological and societal perspective on one side and the market pull on the other, user acceptance is heavily reliant on successful integration of IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The resulting solutions for remote monitoring and control are projected to maximise the expected benefits. A range of vulnerabilities are exposed when such solutions are deployed. Additional risks are presented by a combination of incomplete standardisation and heterogeneous, complex and dynamic nature of available architectures, components and applications. Despite the abundance of applications (e.g. electrification, Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), diverse mobility etc.), there is no established methodology for systematically building homogeneous end-to-end solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The resulting risks are strongly correlated to dependability; a quality that may not be compromised when considering future applications, such as fully autonomous driving, which is expected to drastically minimise traffic fatalities as well as to remove driver/passenger accountability for eventual accidents. The IoT and CPS based solutions are integral constituents of business digitalisation and contribute to the acceleration of development, validation, instrumentation and deployment of complex industrial products over their full lifecycle. The benefits of these solutions are maximised through integration of novel </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Trustworthy IoT for CPS</head><p>IoT4CPS is an Austrian flagship project, formed by diverse industrial and academic partners. The project seeks to generate guidelines, methods and tools for trustworthy and secure integration of IoT and CPS into AD and corresponding smart production. It addresses safety and security aspects in a holistic fashion.</p><p>Common system dependability approaches are adjusted. Additional constraints sourced from highly automated and connected functionalities are also considered. The project's lighthouse status drives for additional needs besides the intended technical achievements. It also aims to provide guidance and inspiration for sustainable exploitation of benefits in the post-project phase. Hence, the project partners are seeking to enhance created impact through identification and coordination of interfaces to related ecosystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Motivation and Paper Structure</head><p>Recent technology advancements impact both connected car and AD. Novel business models and services disrupt the entire traditional Automotive Industry supply chains, e.g. vehicles exchange data with external sources, enabling data analyses that may raise cybersecurity and safety related concerns. For example, a survey of connected and autonomous vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> demonstrates that the greatest obstacles to the growth of the two vehicle types are related to cybersecurity and privacy (63%), intellectual property protection (58%) and safety e.g. personal injury and property liability (55%). By broadening fundamental knowledge of trustworthy CPSs, IoT4CPS is through technical achievements maximising the benefits for its diverse stakeholders. These include, but are not limited to: CPS practitioners, security solution vendors, academic/research institutions, governmental bodies and incident response teams. Increased security levels achieved by adoption of IoT4CPS solutions is directly aimed to benefit AD and smart manufacturing applications. IoT4CPS also targets industrialisation and consequent gain of the market share through improved competitiveness, also promoting SPI's value A <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. Project partners exhibit high commitment to go-to-market strategy. The partner synergy contributes to capitalisation in terms of generation of knowledge, skills and experience through strengthened cooperation with all stakeholders. The industrial partners aim to create new and strengthen the existing revenue streams. This paper considers IoT4CPS's core use case: AD. It demonstrates main concepts of resilient IoT solutions integrated with CPSs, including Digital Twin technology that is directly associated with cybersecurity and privacy capabilities of automotive ecosystem. It also describes the methods to improve stakeholder confidence in technical capabilities and to improve relevant processes (promoting SPI value B <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>) in terms of cybersecurity and safety. The proposed validation methods are designed as mathematical and data science </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Use Case: Autonomous Driving</head><p>One of the IoT4CPS's main use cases focuses on AD. Many core technologies that form the set of complex mechanisms required by AD, have already achieved levels of maturity needed for integration into commercially available vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As safety is a critical factor in driving applications, the use case is used to pinpoint the security and safety aspects of technologies capable of meeting the challenges related to automated and context-aware vehicles. As the project aims to address holistic safety and security along the value chain and the product life cycle, the entire technology stack is considered from semi-conductors (subcomponent level), through control systems (component level), to applications (system level). Vehicle to infrastructure communication is crucial aspect of the use case, due to reliance on information about specific aspects of the external environment. The data exchange and management are also scrutinised in terms of privacy, security and safety. The connected controls in smart cars collect information ranging from driver behaviour data used for analysis and adjustment of personalised settings, to on-board sensor navigation informing about precise vehicle location, where and for how long it was parked. The identifiable driving patterns can help advertising and insurance organisations to tailor their services to the information sourced from the tracking systems. Such data can be further processed, combined and correlated to other sensitive information e.g. bank accounts, health information, etc. Our scenario collects ADAS data and interprets driving patterns, typical routes and driver habits, designed to augment customisation of smart cars and user driving experience. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> illustrates flow of interactions between the smart car (with real-time sensor data measurements and collections), Digital Twin (with historical data and ML analytics models) and a formal security and safety knowledge base with metrics used to detect and assess privacy concerns and risks. The smart car (the real asset) and its digital representation (the Digital Twin) are interact via cloud and edge computing. Smart car is designed to be managed at the edge, capturing various alerts and states measured by its on-board sensors. In the cloud, the Digital Twin captures all the information referring to the operational driving state of the car, including its manufacturing and operational history. The data is transmitted to stakeholders. The real-time insight into the operational driving states provided by the Digital Twin, enables operational efficiency and automated feedback to drivers. As edge and cloud computing raise security and privacy issues, the goal of designing our demonstrator is to detect and assess security and safety conditions and enhance related processes. The overall outcome should be faster and better-informed decisions on possible security and safety vulnerabilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Digital Twin for Security and Safety Validation in Autonomous Driving</head><p>The Digital Twin is a virtual counterpart to actual physical devices (entities).</p><p>The core benefits of the Digital Twin are summarised in the literature as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>:</p><p>-it enables visibility in the manufacturing operations -it can predict the future state of the machines -it can simulate various conditions, which would be impractical in real life -it can be used to connect with the backend business applications to support supply chain, financial decisions etc.</p><p>To achieve such capabilities, the Digital Twin demands technologies and methods to be effectively combined e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI), real-time predictive analyses, and forecasting algorithms using Big Data derived from the IoT sensors and historical data. Through intelligent toolsets and methods, the Digital Twin enables monitoring of execution of simulated processes generated on top of multiple sensor data streams and gains insights required to optimise the processes, improve the entire lifecycle and enhance product performances on the fly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Methodology for the Design and Implementation of Digital Twins for Automotive Security and Safety Validation</head><p>The concept of Digital Twin opens new paths to enhance IoT and CPS security and safety. The literature review on adopting Digital Twins for the Information Security domain suggests several research directions for overcoming current security and safety challenges related to IoT and CPSs. Digital Twins are generally intended to support security and safety capabilities of IoT and CPSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>. For example, an approach presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> compares configuration data of physical devices to their virtual replicas to detect possible manipulated configurations and deviations that may refer to an attack-based compromised CPS setting and enable Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The Digital Twin-based penetration tests could enable relevant tests virtually (instead of on real system), during both the operation phase and during engineering phase to fix vulnerabilities early in the CPS lifecycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Digital Twin concepts are studied for privacy assessments and protection of the privacy of smart cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We suggest the following steps to be taken for the design of Digital Twins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>):</p><p>STEP 1: Identification of assets and relevant security and safety objectives and their modelling. The outcomes are asset data sets, asset lifecycle data (e.g. timeseries sensor data), inferred and historical data, and data describing security and safety objectives. The functionality of a Digital Twin improves over time as more data is accumulated and processed by effective algorithms.</p><p>-Asset modelling is about designing the structure of Digital Twin's assets (physical things) and components, measurable physical parameters and other digital manufacturing information that describe the assets (e.g. maintenance history). Asset modelling adds value to connected sensor data and contributes to new insights, e.g. provides insight on sensor health through inferring, correlates and transforms measured sensor values and asset states, conditions and maintenance records <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. It may also include a different visualisation forms for different user groups, e.g. some users may require insights into operational data, while the others could have interest into devices. -Security and safety objectives identification and modelling are of utmost importance. The iterative process is driven by usage scenarios and application requirements. The output are data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) data related to functional requirements of applications and data related to role-based permissions and policies of the application usage.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Problem Scope: Multi-metrics Approach for Security and Safety Validation</head><p>Our method for security and safety validation is based on the multi-metrics security approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> that requires security metrics to be: (i) measurable (consistently measured, with objective criteria), (ii) context specific e.g. relevant to the CPS assets, (iii) expressed as a cardinal number, average or percentage and (iv) expressed using at least one unit of measure. The adoption of the multimetrics approach suggests the following steps, which can be directly mapped to the steps shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>:</p><p>Step 1: Identify and assign assets to the corresponding layers (e.g. network) and security indicators (e.g. CIA properties). This step is directly mapped to the step 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>.</p><p>Step 2: Select the right metrics according to security requirements and risks.</p><p>Step 3: Analyse the metrics domain values (define value ranges). Note that steps 2 and 3 of the multi-metrics approach correspond to step 2 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>. The analysis of metrics domains needs to be informed by the nature of assets (identified in step 1) and by the threats that are identified as potentially viable for further investigation.</p><p>Step 4: Risk assessment (the probability of occurrence of an undesirable event and the magnitude of its consequences over a specified period). This step of the multi-metrics approach corresponds to the step 3 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>.</p><p>In the following, we describe how the problem scope of the AD use case (from Sect. 2) can be analysed using the multi-metrics approach. Firstly, all mission critical assets and applications are identified. The functionality of the identified assets and applications is described and linked to possible security, privacy and safety concerns and mitigations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Secondly, specific security and safety indicators are assigned to the identified assets and applications and the Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Assets in the automotive driving use case risk assessment for each mission critical asset and application is performed to select the right metrics. Finally, CPS risks and threats are evaluated based on metrics and models for cybersecurity defence, including the probability of their occurrence and the magnitude of possible consequences (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Note that in</p><p>Step 3 of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, analysis of the metrics domain values need to be performed for all assets and applications from Step 1 of the same table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IoT and CPS Security and Safety for AD</head><p>ICT security greatly impacts CPS safety. Many security incidents are owed to design or implementation flaws. ICT system security evaluation is crucial for design and development processes, since such evaluations enable detection of vulnerabilities and their resolve at early stages. A systematic survey of CPS security <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, focuses on security aspects of several distinct and heterogeneous CPSs. The definition of proper criteria for system security evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> in combination with some previously defined frameworks was previously applied for collection and organisation of the criteria e.g. Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) defined by the US Department of Defence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>, or the EC's Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) in 1991. Dependability is a key enabler for development of intelligent systems that enable automatic reasoning based on cloud interactions. Nevertheless, the methods to ensure runtime dependability are yet to be established. Both safety and security engineering focus on system-wide features and must be integrated into the existing process landscape. A major barrier comes from fundamentally different safety and security viewpoints, engineering approaches and nomenclatures.</p><p>The functional safety focuses on defects, failures and errors, which have a potential to be foreseen at design-time, as well as on mathematical models that rely on failure probabilities and system models. The standards, (e.g. ISO26262   <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>) define domain specific processes and methods for development of safetycritical embedded systems. They minimise systematic failures at development (e.g. unimplemented requirement) and to control random failures during operation (e.g. component breakdown). These standards rely on quality management at development stage and on systematic hazard identification and management throughout development lifecycle. Safety augmentation considers: technical concept, validation planning and trace management between these items. Security standards (e.g. ISO 21434 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>) offer high-level guiding principles for the lifecycle process framework, some basic guiding cybersecurity principles, or focus on a subset of complete engineering process. Today's design practice evaluates dependability features during the development, while emerging development of Cyber-Physical System of Systems (CPSoS) evaluates these features at operation time. Hence, there is a need for trustworthy approaches supporting the runtime evaluation of connections and interactions e.g. the Digital Dependability Identity (DDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. We propose leveraging contract-based design for capturing non-functional properties (e.g. safety and security) to describe component behaviour. Contract-based design views components as abstractions -hierarchical entities representing single units of design. Therefore, a component could represent an interface module, a software application, or a control device. The paradigm's essence is to decompose a component into different independent views referred to as contracts, which capture the behaviour of a target functional or non-functional property under certain conditions. Contract-based design contributes to a self-adaptive software system that enables addition of resilience mechanisms to individual and compositions of control devices and adaptations at runtime. The intention of self-adaptive software systems was introduced by the Autonomic Computing Initiative in 2001, in response to anticipated software complexity crisis. Self-adaptive software modifies own behaviour in response to changes in its operating environment. Our proposed self-adaptive system builds upon adaptation loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> called Monitor Analyse Plan Execute -Knowledge (MAPE-K) loop. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> illustrates the SCARI approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, which exploits information of the system virtualised by a digital twin (as in Sect. 3). The system configurations are thus verifiable with respect to functional and non-functional properties. One must ensure correctness of control system's overall configuration at design time and that the self-adaptive software system detects and reacts to anomalies. This application adds safety and security metrics and control mechanisms to control systems.</p><p>The method seeks to tolerate hardware faults, to defend devices against security attacks, to detect software bugs, to reveal misconfigurations and to react to faults in environment. The self-adaptive system is deployed at each device and organised in a hierarchical way. The design time models are used for detection, reasoning, and structural adaptation of single control devices and networks. The transformation of design-time models to run-time models can be done by either a supervisory or commissioning computers. The application of this approach is presented in context of industrial domain CPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Acknowledgment</head><p>Autonomous driving is no longer a vision from the future, but the reality. Its safety and security aspects are considered in a holistic manner, within the scope of IoT4CPS. A method is proposed to address a selection of exposed vulnerabilities with the help of virtualisation through digital twins of complex systems. A methodology is proposed for application of Digital Twins to autonomous vehicles. Its application during the development process and at runtime operation should help tackle risks early in the life cycle of CPSs. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
