from a diverse range of industries and propose a heuristic algorithm for finding a near-optimal solution (digital twin setup) with sub-exponential time complexity.
In addition, we plan to extend the solution to support different pricing strategies
for the various implementations, such as software bundles with contribution
margin-based pricing. We also plan to (1) add new types of constraints, e.g.,
constraints that take the physical space available within the digital twin that
will be implemented (e.g., a small room or an open space) into account; (2)
consider implementations of multiple elements as virtual or simulations on the
same machine; and (3) handle identical setups in an industrial environment
(e.g., if two similar production lines are implemented, there is no need to test
both of them). Finally, a general knowledge base of possible tests and their test
dependencies should be researched and established.",

Calo2018,"Defining the right “high-level guidance”:Access control policies
were introduced as the general approach for simplifying
the application of access control mechanisms to a divergent

set of use-cases. We need to define a similar concept for
“high level guidance” which will be applicable to various
scenarios and contexts in a general way. The semantics to
be used for high-level guidance needs to be defined. While
that semantics can be defined for each of the different generation
approaches discussed in Section 3, an open challenge
remains that of identifying the abstraction that will create
the concept of the “high level guidance” that will be applicable
to a broad set of use-case scenarios regardless of the
approach used to generate policies.
(2) Defining the right discovery process: Generating the right
access control policy requires each of the resources in the
environment to be aware of the other devices in the environment.
Given the lack of widely adopted standards for
discovery of resources, and the many security exposures
that may result from a flawed discovery process, new discovery
techniques that can provide sufficient security in many
dynamic contexts are needed.
(3) Determining the situational context: The definition of the
situational context, as well as its determination, remains
a hard and open research challenge. Access control needs
to account for not only the other resources that any given
resource interacts with, but also for the resources that may
indirectly use the information provided by that resource.
Understanding the situation on the ground in sufficient detail
to provide workable security is a challenge that can be solved
on a case-by-case basis, but a general formulation remains
an open challenge.
(4) Policy deconfliction without human guidance: When access
control policies are generated by the resources, they may
conflict among themselves, or with other policies that are
imposed on the system to meet other requirements, such
as performance, reliability or availability requirements. In
the presence of a human, such conflicts can be resolved and
deconflicted using the human provided input. Similar algorithms,
which can operate without a human in the loop, need
to be developed.
(5) Controlling emergent behavior: When resources create their
own policies, there is a danger of uncontrolled emergent
behavior [15]. Emergent behavior is behavior shown by a
collection of systems which was not originally designed but
happens due to the dynamic interactions among different intelligent
systems. Such emergent behavior can be controlled,
but the design needs to account for that. The control of
emergent behavior in complete generality remains an open
challenge, but there may be solutions that can be developed
for specific domain of access control.
(6) Learning-related challenges: The approach used by resources
to learn their access control policy has to use some type of
learning approach, which creates a generalization based on
its past experiences, but such learning mechanism has its
challenges. The set of experiences for access control in each
use-case has only a few small data points to draw from,
which means that either existing learning techniques that
use only a few data points need to be used, or new learning
techniques requiring small data for training needs to be actor may manipulate the data so as to force the device to
learn an invalid model which could lead to generation of
insecure access control policies. Solutions to such adversarial
learning in uncontrolled environments need to be developed.
(7) Increase in attack surface. The increase in complexity due
to autonomous generation of policies by devices can lead
to new types of security vulnerabilities and threats, e.g. the
adversarial learning example given above. This could lead to
challenges with established assurance processes in enterprise
and government networks, and the right way to provide
assurance for systems using dynamically generated access
control policies need to be developed.
(8) Power, computation and communication efficiency. While in
the past several years there have been tremendous advantages
in the computational capacity of small devices, devices
that need to learn and manage their own policies may find
themselves unable to use approaches that require specialized
hardware, or significant computational power, e.g. learning
mechanisms based on deep neural networks. For any solution
developed with dynamic access control policies, system
design should incorporate mechanisms that take into account
the limitations on a resource, which usually manifests
itself as limited amount of battery power, computational
capacity or the ability to communicate at high bandwidth
rates.",

closure of feedback loops along and the coherent linkage
between the lifecycle phases of the asset. Here, the gain of
new insights can lead to a win-win situation among the
involved parties. Currently, very little is known about
potential data-driven business models, their power of digital
disruptiveness and pricing strategies for DT services.
Research can contribute by identifying the strategic role of

detecting deviations in the behavior of digital twins to spot attacks
as early as possible",   
Eckhart2018a,"While the results of this work are promising, there are still some
challenges to be addressed to improve the state replication approach.
For example, depending on the nature of the device or caused by
inaccuracies of the specification, inferring the device’s characteristics
based on the role definition may be infeasible. In this case,
users are required to either add details about stimuli or explicitly
label inputs as stimuli. Another possible option, yet more complex
to implement, may be to develop a code analyzer that automatically
inspects all programs, which are referenced in a CPS’s specification,
for the purpose of stimuli identification. Furthermore, as our
approach focuses only on states of software programs, support for
replicating stimuli that manifest themselves in the form of analog
signals is lacking. Thus, analog values that constitute stimuli must
be converted to a binary representation, before they can be replicated
in the virtual environment. However, considering that CPSs
typically consist of analog-intensive components, further research
in this area is worth pursuing.",

Empl2021,"In the future, we will work on implementing a prototype of this
security analytics service. The design of a specific implementation
can be structured in several ways.We recommend a design based on
virtual machines, dockerized applications, and specific connectors
for a straightforward adoption and application of the capability
modules. As we admit in the introduction, data is vital to generate
wisdom. By bundling the data sources and types of data (stream
vs batch) required to fulfil a particular capability module (e.g., the
descriptive module takes batch data), analytical techniques can be
instantiated. Thus, each capability module should be represented by
one virtual machine. The virtual machines can be interconnected
with dedicated bridges to accomplish the dependencies between
the capability modules. Each of the virtual machines is running
on Docker to establish containerized and modular applications.
There are many open-source software and tools for security analytics
applications that need to be categorized depending on their
functionality, e.g., Suricata is an intrusion detection tool and is,
therefore, available in the detective module. In this context, the
security analytics repository is considered a collection of dockerized
applications. Besides provisioning dockerized applications, the
security analytics repositories need to yield connectors for each
application to bind multiple applications’ sinks and sources. Additionally,
machine learning models can be shared across the security
analytics repository and integrated into the desired capability module.
Those machine learning models might be integrated into the
predictive module (stream data) and the descriptive module (batch
data). The different analytical techniques can be tagged inside the
security analytics repository (e.g. for detective module) and ranked
by other users. These mechanisms are resulting in transparency as
to which methods are successfully contributing to the cybersecurity",

Veledar2019,N/A,   
Wu2020,"Therefore, in future work, a way has to be found for the collaborative and
consistent description of needs between different stakeholders,
as well as their validation and evolution. Therefore, the future research focus is to connect the dots
between the existing isolated technologies as they are not consistently
aggregated, which requires a multidisciplinary system
integration that across lifecycle phases. But what useful data fromCPPSs can be integrated effectively
into EIS has not been addressed and need to be investigated in
future work. One future direction concerning
the branch of the additional information in the concept map
is to investigate how to extract additional information to
improve the EISs in terms of business processes and its evolution. This level covers all three dimensions of integration.
Concerning the branch of decision making in the concept
map, one future direction of the organizational integration is
to figure out how to decentralize part of the decisions that are
currently made in the EISs field to CPPSs’ components (such
as smart machines and smart products).",

Xu2021,"In future work, we plan to conduct more experiments on
real-world CPS of various domains to evaluate the scalability
and generalization of ATTAIN. We will also consider exploring
digital twins for more challenging tasks, such as detecting
attacks targeting multiple CPS at the same time, which requires
developing an integrated digital twin model. We also want
to investigate how digital twins can be extended to provide
additional advanced analyses during the operation of CPS such
as predicting uncertainties and non-functional properties.",
